        Typically, this is a URL to a repository on GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc. for resources like ontologies. This is useful in two ways: first, it allows to quickly find the related issue tracker. Second, it enables external contributions.

      description: |
        The regular expression (regex) that matches all of the identifiers in the nomenclature authority. If you're not sure how to write a regex, please make sure you've included an example identifier and we'll be happy to help you out!

        Do include a carat `^` at the beginning and a dollar sign `$` at the end to signify that your pattern only matches the identifier, and not potentially any other parts of the string.

        Do not include a redundant prefix within the pattern (e.g., do not write `^CHEBI:\d+$`).
      placeholder: ex. ^\d+$

      description: |
        A URI format string is a URI with a placeholder (`$1`) for the local unique identifier that can be used in combination with a given local unique identifier to make a URI for the local unique identifier.

        While it is encouraged that these URIs can resolved to a webpage, it is not strictly necessary, e.g in the case of many ontologies, URIs are auto-generated.
