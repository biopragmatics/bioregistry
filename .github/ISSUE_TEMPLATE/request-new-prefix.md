## Required

The following fields are required for all new entries in the Bioregistry:

### Name

> Replace this with the full name of the resource (expand all acronyms, please)

### Description

> Replace this with a description of the resource. A good description says what kind of entities the resource makes identifiers for, why the resource exists, and who might want to use it.

### Prefix

> Replace this with the prefix you'd like to assign to this resource

### Homepage

> Replace this with the homepage for the resource. If your resource is part of a website that issues several resources, try picking a page that's as specific as possible.

### Example Identifier

> Replace this with an example identifier from the resource.

## Optional

The following entries are optional, but nice to have. If you're having trouble with some of these, go ahead and submit your issue and we can discuss below :)

### Pattern

> Replace this with a regular expression that matches all identifiers in the resource. Do not include redundant information about the prefix within the pattern. This information can be inferred from the "Namespace Embedded in Identifier" field directly below

### Namespace Embedded in Identifier

> Replace this if the namespace appears in the identifier. Please write it out exactly as it appears in the identifier. For example, a GO identifier contains a redundant `GO:`, so write this text exactly.

### Contact Email

> Replace this with the contact email address for the resource. Note: this will be public.

### Comments

> Replace this with any free text you want to include with this resource in an additional field to the description
