"""Run the mapping checking workflow.

Detect potentially incorrect mappings by comparing embeddings of bioregistry entry metadata
against the metadata corresponding to mapped prefixes. Low similarity scores indicate a potential
false positive mapping that can be reviewed manually and removed if confirmed to be incorrect.

Run with either of the following commands:

1. ``uv run --script mapping_checking.py``
2. ``python -m bioregistry.analysis.mapping_checking``
3. ``tox -e mapping-checking``
