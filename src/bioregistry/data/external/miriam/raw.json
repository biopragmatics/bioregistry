        "description": "Archival Resource Keys (ARKs) serve as persistent identifiers, or stable, trusted references for information objects. Among other things, they aim to be web addresses (URLs) that don’t return 404 Page Not Found errors. The ARK Alliance is an open global community supporting the ARK infrastructure on behalf of research and scholarship. End users, especially researchers, rely on ARKs for long term access to the global scientific and cultural record. Since 2001 some 8.2 billion ARKs have been created by over 1000 organizations — libraries, data centers, archives, museums, publishers, government agencies, and vendors. They identify anything digital, physical, or abstract. ARKs are open, mainstream, non-paywalled, decentralized persistent identifiers that can be created by an organization as soon as it is registered with a NAAN (Name Assigning Authority Number). Once registered, an ARK organization can create unlimited numbers of ARKs and publicize them via the n2t.net global resolver or via their own local resolver.",

For example, an Evidence Item might describe a line of evidence supporting the notion that tumors with a somatic BRAF V600 mutation generally respond well to the drug dabrafenib. A Variant may be a single nucleotide substitution, a small insertion or deletion, an RNA gene fusion, a chromosomal rearrangement, an RNA expression pattern (e.g. over-expression), etc. Each clinical Evidence statement corresponds to a single citable Source (a publication or conference abstract).",

In the genomics era, while gene expression, genetic association, and network analysis provide unprecedented means to decode the genetic basis of complex phenotypes, it is important to recognize the possible effects genetic progress in one trait can have on other traits. This database is designed to collect all published livestock genetic/phenotypic trait correlation data, aimed at facilitating genetic network analysis or systems biology studies.",

Monitoring of regulatory agencies for new drugs approvals ensures the resource is up-to-date. DrugCentral integrates content for active ingredients with pharmaceutical formulations, indexing drugs and drug label annotations, complementing similar resources available online. Its complementarity with other online resources is facilitated by cross referencing to external resources. At the molecular level, DrugCentral bridges drug-target interactions with pharmacological action and indications. The integration with FDA drug labels enables text mining applications for drug adverse events and clinical trial information. Chemical structure overlap between DrugCentral and five online drug resources, and the overlap between DrugCentral FDA-approved drugs and their presence in four different chemical collections, are discussed. DrugCentral can be accessed via the web application or downloaded in relational database format.",

The Human Endogenous Retrovirus Database (hERV) is compiled from the human genome nucleotide sequences obtained from Human Genome Projects, and screens those sequences for hERVs, whilst continuously improving classification and characterization of retroviral families.

Information in GOLD is organized into four levels: Study, Biosample/Organism, Sequencing Project and Analysis Project. \nStudy is an umbrella Project that broadly defines the overall goal of a research proposal. It consists of sequencing projects along with corresponding organism or Biosample information as well as any analysis done on the sequencing projects.\nE.g., Gs0016050: Human Microbiome Project (HMP), Gs0000008: A Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea (GEBA) study.\nBiosample is the description of the environment from where the DNA/RNA sample was collected. Currently GOLD Biosample entities are defined for all metagenome and metatranscriptomes projects, i.e. for non-isolate genomes. E.g., Gb0055733\nOrganism is an individual living thing. It can be a bacterium, plant, fungus etc. In GOLD, all isolate or single cell genome sequencing projects are associated with an organism. Additionally, GOLD Organisms are also created for genomes assembled from metagenome sequences(MAGs). E.g., Go0003442\nSequencing Project represents the procedures undertaken for generating sequencing output from an individual Organism or Biosample. An individual genome project may be composed of more than one sequencing reactions and/or sequencing technologies. A Sequencing Project may be an isolate genome, or a metagenome, transcriptome, or metatranscriptome etc.\nE.g., Gp0003442\nAnalysis Project represents the computational processing of sequencing data generated by a sequencing project. It describes how the assembly and annotation of a Sequencing Project were performed. \nE.g., Ga0027275",

LiceBase is a database for sea lice genomics, providing genome annotation of the Atlantic salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis, a genome browser, and access to related high-thoughput genomics data. LiceBase also mines and stores data from related genome sequencing and functional genomics projects.",

        "description": "The PANTHER (Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships) Classification System is a resource that classifies genes by their functions, using published scientific experimental evidence and evolutionary relationships to predict function even in the absence of direct experimental evidence. The PANTHER Pathway Component collection references specific classes of molecules that play the same mechanistic role within a pathway, across species. Pathway\r\ncomponents may be proteins, genes/DNA, RNA, or simple molecules. Where the identified component is a protein, DNA, or transcribed RNA, it is associated with protein sequences in the PANTHER protein family trees through manual curation.",

The families in Rfam break down into three broad functional classes: non-coding RNA genes, structured cis-regulatory elements and self-splicing RNAs. Typically these functional RNAs often have a conserved secondary structure which may be better preserved than the RNA sequence. The CMs used to describe each family are a slightly more complicated relative of the profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) used by Pfam. CMs can simultaneously model RNA sequence and the structure in an elegant and accurate fashion.",

Each data release contains the complete genomic sequences for all viral pathogens and related strains that are available for species in the above-named families. In addition to sequence data, the VBRC provides a curation for each virus species, resulting in a searchable, comprehensive mini-review of gene function relating genotype to biological phenotype, with special emphasis on pathogenesis.",
