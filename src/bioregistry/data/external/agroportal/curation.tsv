AEO	Agricultural Experiments Ontology	http://lovinra.inra.fr/	AEO is an ontology aimed to represent objects related to agricultural practices.
AFEO	Agri-Food Experiment Ontology	http://opensilex.org/vocabulary/2016/v1/afeo.owl	The Agri-Food Experiment Ontology (AFEO), a new ontology network was developed based on two existing ontology resources, i.e., OAE (Ontology for Agriculture Experiment) and OFPE (Ontology for Food Processing Experiment).
AFO	Agriculture and Forestry Ontology		The Agriculture and Forestry Ontology (AFO) is based on the Agriforest thesaurus maintained by the Viikki Campus Library, University of Helsinki. The combination of AFO and the Finnish General Upper Ontology YSO has been created in the FinnONTO project by the Viikki Science Library in cooperation with the Semantic Computing Research Group. The ontology was created by aligning the Agriculture and Forestry Ontology with the Finnish General Upper Ontology (YSO) using the top ontology and other modelling principles of YSO. This way the equivalent and differing concepts and their links to more general concepts could be explicitly described. This combination of ontologies can be used for describing resources especially in domain of agriculture, forestry, veterinary medicine, food science, environmental science and biology.
AGRORDF	AGRORDF	http://www.openagramap.org	agroXML is an XML dialect for representing and describing farm work. It provides elements and XML data types for representing data on work processes on the farm including accompanying operating supplies like fertilizers, pesticides, crops and the like. It can be used within farm management information systems as a file format for documentation purposes but also within web services and interfaces between the farm and external stakeholders as a means to exchange data in a structured, standardized and easy to use way. It covers topics relevant to on farm activity including “crop”, “cropSpecies”, “chemical substance”, “harvestDate”, “enginePower”. There exists an XML version and an RDF version.

ASCOPAIN-T	Terminology of French bread descriptors		"The AsCoPain-T terminology lists and defines the main quality assessment descriptors used by bread-making professionals and those used in scientific studies. It aims at linking professional and scientific terminologies, as language can vary greatly to denote similar processing operations and observations that are made on the dough and bread.
The AsCoPain-T terminology is the result of successive efforts: expert knowledge collected by the INRA AsCoPain project first resulted in the definition of the relations between bread-making control variables and the different states of the dough and bread. These relations were implemented into the expert system used to predict the state of the dough throughout the kneading process. The terminology collected during this work was then published in the form of a glossary in a document referenced by the FAO (see http://prodinra.inra.fr/record/48319).
The recent adaptation of its content to the semantic web standards now allows unforeseen uses, in particular by applications. The terminology is available in French. Its translation in English will soon be under way. , La terminologie AsCoPain-T définit les descripteurs qualité utilisés usuellement par les professionnels de la panification et ceux issus des travaux scientifiques. Son objectif est d’établir un lien entre terminologies professionnelles et scientifiques ; le langage employé pour caractériser les mêmes opérations de la transformation et les nécessaires observations de la pâte étant très varié. 
La terminologie AsCoPain-T est issue d’un travail préalable de recueil de connaissances dans le cadre du projet INRA AsCoPain qui a permis d’intégrer les relations entre des variables de contrôle du procédé de panification et des états de la pâte et du pain dans un système expert de prédiction de l’état de la pâte tout au long de l’opération de pétrissage. Ce travail a aussi produit un glossaire terminologique publié dans un document référencé par la FAO (voir http://prodinra.inra.fr/record/48319). 
L’adaptation de son contenu aux standards du web sémantique permet d’envisager de nouveaux usages de la terminologie, notamment son utilisation par des programmes informatiques. La terminologie est disponible en français et une version en anglais est en projet."

CGO	Common Greenhouse Ontology	https://gitlab.com/ddings/common-greenhouse-ontology	Greenhouses are used to grow vegetables and plants year-round. The climate in the greenhouse has a considerable influence on the growth of the crops. Therefore, it is important to optimally control the climate. Increasingly more tools become available to help with this, such as a climate computer, sensors, and other systems. All these systems produce different data, such as temperatures, crop growth, weather statistics, which is stored in different databases. In this repository, you can find the Common Greenhouse Ontology (CGO). It provides semantic alignment of different databases, as well as a standard on high-tech greenhouses and their components. The CGO was created in a national project Data-Driven Integrated Greenhouse Systems (DDINGS). In this project, a platform was created to connect databases and perform data analysis [1]. In that work, we also introduced a first version of the CGO. Since then, we fully developed the CGO with different modules, a broad set of classes that describe the components of greenhouses, and an integration with other ontologies such as the Semantic Sensor Network ontology [2] and the Ontology of units of Measure [3]

GACS	Global Agricultural Concept Scheme	http://agrisemantics.org/gacs/	The Global Agricultural Concept Scheme (GACS) is a hub for concepts related to agriculture, in multiple languages, for use in Linked Data. The idea for GACS emerged out of discussions at the World Congress of IAALD, the International Association of Agricultural Information Specialists, in July 2013. The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), CAB International (CABI), and the National Agricultural Library of the USA (NAL) agreed in October 2013 to explore the feasibility of developing a shared concept scheme by integrating their three thesauri: the AGROVOC Concept Scheme, the CAB Thesaurus (CABT), and NAL Thesaurus (NALT). In the GACS vision, the integration of these three thesauri is but the first step towards the realization of a hub that links to and from the concept schemes beyond the initial three, and in multiple language areas.

PEAO	Plant Experimental Assay Ontology	https://bitbucket.org/PlantExpAssay/ontology	The Plant domain has been the subject of several attempts to structure and formally define terms and corresponding relations, such as their anatomical features, developmental stages, and the application of particular experimental procedures to a biological problem. However, a focus on experimental assays in order to describe the whole experimental procedure, to the best of our knowledge, has only been attempted in the context of a very general description based on classical views of the scientific method. In this study, we focus on the development and proposal of an ontology dedicated to the description of these experimental procedures, regardless of the scientific questions that prompted the assays. This ontology includes entities from three distinct realms (biological, physical and data), which include both experimental products, their relations and the protocols describing their manipulation.

The STARS4ALL project is composed by partners such as Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, ESCP Europe, Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries, Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias, University of Southampton, Europan Crowdfunding Network, and CEFRIEL (Società Consortile a Responsabilita Limitata). SAREF4ENVI has two main aims: on the one hand, to be the basis for enabling the use of SAREF in the environment domain and, on the other hand, to exemplify how to enable interoperability between environmental devices in cooperation. SAREF4ENVI is an OWL-DL ontology that extends SAREF with 32 classes (24 defined in SAREF4ENVI and 7 reused from the time, SAREF and geo ontologies), 24 object properties (22 defined in SAREF4ENVI and 2 reused from the SAREF and geo ontologies), 13 data type properties (9 defined in SAREF4ENVI and 4 reused from the SAREF ontology), and 24 individuals (9 defined in SAREF4ENVI and 12 reused from the OM ontology). SAREF4ENVI focuses on extending SAREF for photometers to solve the lack of interoperability between sensors that can measure and share information about light pollution. Such extension involves the following use cases (more details can be found in ETSI TR 103 411 [i.1]): Use case 1: Monitor light pollution in a city, through the data collected by photometers about the magnitude of the light emitted in a given area. Use case 2: Adjust lampposts light intensity due to high pollution, after identifying the most contaminating lampposts and therefore the areas where more energy is being thrown away. Use case 3: Register a photometer, in which a new collection of photometers is incorporated into an existing sensor network.

SNPO	Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Ontology	https://members.loria.fr/ACoulet/files/snpontology1.6_description.html	SNP-Ontology is a domain ontology that provides a formal representation (OWL-DL) of genomic variations. Despite its name, SNP-Ontology, is not limited to the representation of SNPs but it encompasses genomic variations in a broader meaning. SNP-Ontology is general enough to enable the representation of variations observed in genome of various species. Latest versions of SNP-Ontology include the representation of haplotype and of CNV. The unambiguous representation of genomic variations provided by SNP-Ontology enables to integrate heterogeneous data related to genomic variations. To achieve this goal SNP-Ontology enables (1) to represent one variation in accordance with various ways that exist for describing it, (2) to represent the equivalence between two distinct descriptions of one variation, and (3) to represent correspondence between a genomic variation and its outcome at the transcriptome and proteome levels.

TOP	Thesaurus of Plant Characteristics	http://top-thesaurus.org	The Thesaurus Of Plant characteristics (TOP), aims to harmonize and formalize concepts for plant characteristics widely used in ecology. TOP concentrates on two types of plant characteristics: traits and environmental associations. Characteristics are modelled as the ‘Quality’ of an ‘Entity’ used in the context of Open Biological Ontologies. Whenever possible, the Entities and Qualities are taken from existing terminology standards, mainly the Plant Ontology (PO) and Phenotypic Quality Ontology (PATO) ontologies. TOP provides names, definitions, units, synonyms and related terms for about 850 plant characteristics.
TRANSMAT	Matter Transfer Ontology	https://www6.inra.fr/cati-icat-atweb/Ontologies/Transmat	The Matter Transfer ontology is dedicated to matter transfer (e.g. O2, CO2, H2O) and mechanical properties of materials (eg food packaging tensile strength).

WHEAT_TAX	Wheat Taxa Gold Standard	http://ontology.irstea.fr/pmwiki.php/Site/AgronomicTaxon	Manually built by Catherine Roussey, inspired by https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomiedublé. Each species proposed into the wheat species table have been validated with European Wheat data base http://genbank.vurv.cz/ewdb/. The taxon name and its ranking was firstly validated with the use of taxref reference table from INPN. NCBI's taxonomy have been used when not found in taxref. Then links to agrovoc's thesaurus, NAL and CABI Have been added. Links to ITIS database have been added, and also the links to DBpedia. Be warned : DBpedia contains two missing species :triticum zhukovsyi and triticum compactum erinaceum which are not in taxref. triticum zhukovsyi is in European Wheat data base. Links to TAXREF-LD have also been added.
