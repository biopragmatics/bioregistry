This domain of interest is further defined as:\r\n\r\nProtocol-driven research and its associated regulatory artifacts: i.e. the data, organization, resources, rules, and processes involved in the formal assessment of the utility, impact, or other pharmacological, physiological, or psychological effects of a drug, procedure, process, or device on a human, animal, or other subject or substance plus all associated regulatory artifacts required for or derived from this effort, including data specifically associated with post-marketing adverse event reporting.\r\n\r\nThis OWL version of the BRIDG model is create by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). \r\n\r\nSource repository: https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/WebSVN/listing.php?repname=bridg-model&path=%2Ftrunk%2FModel+-+OWL%2F&","documentation":null,"publication":null,"publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","date_created":"2012-09-04T20:57:02Z","home_page":"http://www.bridgmodel.org/","version":"3.2","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":0,"nb_individuals":0,"nb_properties":0,"max_depth":0,"max_children":0,"avg_children":0,"classifiable":false,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":false,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"CCO","name":"Cell Cycle Ontology","status":"Unloadable","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":429,"download_url":"media/ontologies/CCO/9/cco.owl","submission_id":9,"domain":null,"description":"An application ontology integrating knowledge about the eukaryotic cell cycle.","documentation":null,"publication":"http://genomebiology.com/2009/10/5/R58","publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2015-12-16T00:00:00Z","date_created":"2015-12-16T08:32:30Z","home_page":"http://www.semantic-systems-biology.org/apo/","version":"2015","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":0,"nb_individuals":0,"nb_properties":0,"max_depth":0,"max_children":0,"avg_children":0,"classifiable":false,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":false,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"RCD","name":"Read Codes, Clinical Terms Version 3 (CTV3) ","status":"Unloadable","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":443,"download_url":"media/ontologies/RCD/9/rcd.umls","submission_id":9,"domain":null,"description":"Clinical Terms Version 3 (CTV3) (Read Codes) (Q199): National Health Service National Coding and Classification Centre","documentation":null,"publication":null,"publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2017-02-06T21:26:21Z","date_created":"2017-02-06T21:26:21Z","home_page":null,"version":"2016AB","has_ontology_language":"UMLS","nb_classes":140065,"nb_individuals":0,"nb_properties":3,"max_depth":17,"max_children":162,"avg_children":3,"classifiable":false,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":false,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"InterNano","name":"InterNano Nanomanufacturing Taxonomy","status":"Unloadable","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":464,"download_url":"media/ontologies/InterNano/138/internano.owl","submission_id":138,"domain":null,"description":"The InterNano Taxonomy is a unique, custom-built terminology to describe the nanomanufacturing enterprise.

The BIM ontology provides semantic vocabularies to describe the manually curated image annotations as well as annotations generated by online bioinformatics services using content extracted from images by the Semantic Enrichment of Biomedical Images (SEBI) system. The BIM ontology is represented in three parts; (i) image vocabularies - which holds vocabularies for the annotation of an image and/or region of interests (ROI) inside an image, as well as vocabularies to represent the pre and post processing states of an image, (ii) text entities - covers annotations from the text that are associated with an image (e.g. image captions) and provides semantic representation for NLP algorithm outputs, (iii) a provenance model  - that contributes towards the maintenance of annotation versioning. To illustrate the BIM ontology’s utility, we provide three annotation cases generated by BIM in conjunction with the SEBI image annotation engine.","documentation":"http://cbakerlab.unbsj.ca/unbvps/BIM","publication":"https://code.google.com/p/bio-ont/","publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2014-09-26T00:00:00Z","date_created":"2015-10-08T22:02:57Z","home_page":"https://sites.google.com/site/bimontology/","version":"1.3","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":125,"nb_individuals":34,"nb_properties":73,"max_depth":3,"max_children":50,"avg_children":6,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"EPO","name":"Early Pregnancy Ontology","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":767,"download_url":"media/ontologies/EPO/1/epo.owl","submission_id":1,"domain":null,"description":"The early pregnancy ontology contains the concepts to describe ectopic pregnancy ultrasound images, organized into several subsumption hierarchies for types of ectopic pregnancies and the signs, anatomical structures and technical elements of imaging associated with ectopic pregnancy.\r\nVersion 1.1 was used for ultrasound image annotations (Dhombres et al.

The domain that has been chosen is human nervous system (HNS) disorders. It is hypothesized here that an ontology-based patient records management system is more effective in meeting and addressing complex information needs of health-care personnel. Therefore, this study has been based on the premise that developing an ontology and using it as a component of the search interface in hospital records management systems will lead to more efficient and effective management of health-care. It is proposed here to develop an ontology of the domain of HNS disorders using a standard vocabulary such as MeSH or SNOMED CT. The principal classes of an ontology include facet analysis for arranging concepts based on their common characteristics to build mutually exclusive classes. We combine faceted theory with description logic, which helps us to better query and retrieve data by implementing an ontological model. Protégé 5.2.0 was used as ontology editor. The use of ontologies for domain modelling will be of acute help to doctors for searching patient records. In this paper we show how the faceted approach helps us to build a flexible model and retrieve better information. We use the medical domain as a case study to show examples and implementation.","documentation":"https://github.com/subhashishhh/HNS-Ontology","publication":"https://www.ergon-verlag.de/isko_ko/downloads/ko_46_2019_3_c.pdf","publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","date_created":"2020-05-05T19:45:08Z","home_page":"https://github.com/subhashishhh/HNS-Ontology/blob/master/HNS_ontology.owl","version":"4.0","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":546,"nb_individuals":142,"nb_properties":15,"max_depth":7,"max_children":28,"avg_children":4,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"HOIP","name":"Homeostasis

It is a component of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project (https://commonfund.nih.gov/idg). The DTO project develops a novel semantic framework to formalize knowledge about drug targets with a focus on the current IDG protein families. The DTO is developed as a reference for drug targets with the longer-term goal to create a community standard that will facilitate the integration of diverse drug discovery information from numerous heterogeneous resources. The first version of the DTO consists of asserted class hierarchies of the four IDG protein families, GPCRs, kinases, ion channels, and nuclear hormone receptors. Protein classes are linked to tissue and disease via different levels of confidence. DTO also contains drug target development level classifications developed in the IDG project (http://targetcentral.ws/), and functional and qualitative annotations and classifications for kinase proteins, GPCR ligands and ion channels. DTO is modeled in OWL2-DL to enable further classification by inference reasoning and SPARQL queries. DTO is implemented following a modularization approach. DTO is used as the organizational framework for drug targets in the IDG PHAROS User Interface Portal (https://pharos.nih.gov) and also the Tin-X Target Importance and Novelty Explorer (http://newdrugtargets.org).","documentation":"http://drugtargetontology.org/","publication":"http://drugtargetontology.org/","publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2017-12-08T02:01:34Z","date_created":"2017-12-08T02:01:35Z","home_page":"http://drugtargetontology.org/","version":"1.1","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":10075,"nb_individuals":3,"nb_properties":42,"max_depth":11,"max_children":636,"avg_children":4,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"DUO","name":"Data Use Ontology","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":4303,"download_url":"media/ontologies/DUO/9/duo.owl","submission_id":9,"domain":null,"description":"DUO is an ontology which represent data use conditions.","documentation":null,"publication":null,"publications":null,"products":[{"id":"duo.owl","ontology_purl":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/duo.owl"}],"taxon":null,"date_released":"2021-03-01T13:17:10.013258Z","date_created":"2021-03-01T13:17:10.013270Z","home_page":"https://github.com/EBISPOT/DUO","version":null,"has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":300,"nb_individuals":22,"nb_properties":51,"max_depth":11,"max_children":39,"avg_children":4,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":"b150506aa3a0fece85eef888f09c0388"}},{"acronym":"ECP","name":"Electronic Care Plan","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":681,"download_url":"media/ontologies/ECP/2/ecp.owl","submission_id":2,"domain":null,"description":"Our focus in this work is to define in a formal way (ontology-based) and platform independent representative metadata and relationships of care plans.

disease (AD) pathophysiology is still imperfectly understood and current paradigms have not led to curative outcome. Omics technologies offer great promises for improving our understanding and generating new hypotheses. However, integration and interpretation of such data pose major challenges, calling for adequate knowledge models. AlzPathway is a disease map that gives a detailed and broad account of AD pathophysiology. However, AlzPathway lacks formalism, which can lead to ambiguity and misinterpretation.

The initial proposal of the first stage project is presented in Hindawi Publishing Corporation http://www.hindawi.com- The Scientific World Journal with the title “FoodWiki: Ontology-driven Mobile Safe Food Consumption System”. After that, another project as an extension of the first stage project was funded again by TUBITAK toward the end of 2014.

BAO is an extensible, knowledge-based, highly expressive (currently SHOIQ(D)) description of biological assays making use of descriptive logic based features of the Web Ontology Language (OWL).  BAO currently has over 1000 classes and also makes use of several other ontologies.  It describes several concepts related to biological screening, including Perturbagen, Format, Meta Target, Design,  Detection Technology, and Endpoint.  Perturbagens are perturbing agents that are screened in an assay; they are mostly small molecules. Assay Meta Target describes what is known about the biological system and / or its components interrogated in the assay (and influenced by the Perturbagen).  Meta target can be directly described as a molecular entity (e.g. a purified protein or a protein complex), or indirectly by a biological process or event (e.g. phosphorylation).  Format describes the biological or chemical features common to each test condition in the assay and includes biochemical, cell-based, organism-based, and variations thereof.  The assay Design describes the assay methodology and implementation of how the perturbation of the biological system is translated into a detectable signal.  Detection Technology relates to the physical method and technical details to detect and record a signal.  Endpoints are the final HTS results as they are usually published (such as IC50, percent inhibition, etc.).  BAO has been designed to accommodate multiplexed assays.  All main BAO components include multiple levels of sub-categories and specification classes, which are linked via object property relationships forming an expressive knowledge-based representation.","documentation":"http://www.bioassayontology.org/","publication":"http://www.bioassayontology.org/","publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2017-10-05T01:00:16Z","date_created":"2017-10-05T01:00:16Z","home_page":"http://www.bioassayontology.org/","version":"2.3.3","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":7125,"nb_individuals":1,"nb_properties":223,"max_depth":13,"max_children":178,"avg_children":3,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"SITBAC","name":"Situation-Based Access Control Ontology","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":147,"download_url":"media/ontologies/SITBAC/3/sitbac.owl","submission_id":3,"domain":null,"description":"Context-based healthcare access-control policies","documentation":null,"publication":null,"publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","date_created":"2011-02-22T06:31:24Z","home_page":"http://mis.hevra.haifa.ac.il/~morpeleg/","version":"1.3","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":178,"nb_individuals":163,"nb_properties":74,"max_depth":5,"max_children":10,"avg_children":3,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"SMASHSOCIAL","name":"SMASH ontology, Social Activity Ontology","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":444,"download_url":"media/ontologies/SMASHSOCIAL/4/smashsocial.owl","submission_id":4,"domain":null,"description":"The SMASH (Semantic Mining of Activity, Social, and Health data) system ontology describes concepts used in describing the semantic features of healthcare data and social networks.

In order to bridge the gap between the overflow of HTS data and the bottleneck of integrated analysis tools, herein, we provide the first comprehensive GPCR ontology. The development and utility of GPCR ontology was based on previously developed BioAssay Ontology (BAO). The GPCR ontology contains information about biochemical, pharmacological, and functional properties of individual GPCRs as well as GPCR-selective ligands inclusive of their HTS screening results and other records.

Facet-based methodology has been used for ontology formalization for quite some time. Ontology formalization involves different steps such as identification of the terminology, analysis, synthesis, standardization and ordering. A vast majority of the ontologies being developed nowadays lack flexibility. This becomes a formidable constraint when it comes to interoperability. We found that a facet-based method provides a distinct guideline for the development of a robust and flexible model concerning the domain of brain tumours. Our attempt has been to bridge library and information science and computer science, which itself involved an experimental approach. It was discovered that a faceted approach is really enduring, as it helps in the achievement of properties like navigation, exploration and faceted browsing. Computer-based brain tumour ontology supports the work of researchers towards gathering information on brain tumour research and allows users across the world to intelligently access new scientific information quickly and efficiently.","documentation":"https://github.com/subhashishhh/BTO-Ontology","publication":"Das, Subhashis, and Sayon Roy. \"Faceted Ontological Model for Brain Tumour Study.\" KO KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION 43, no. 1 (2016): 3-12.","publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","date_created":"2020-05-04T09:51:06Z","home_page":"https://github.com/subhashishhh/BTO-Ontology/blob/master/BrainTumour_ontology.owl","version":"1","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":28,"nb_individuals":146,"nb_properties":9,"max_depth":4,"max_children":11,"avg_children":4,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"MCCL","name":"Cell Line Ontology [by Mahadevan]","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":328,"download_url":"media/ontologies/MCCL/2/mccl.owl","submission_id":2,"domain":null,"description":"Ontologies provide a common platform of controlled vocabulary for researchers who need to share information across a particular domain, inclusive of machine-interpretable definitions of basic concepts in the domain and relations among them. The need for ontologies that provide a systematic arrangement of available data and allow cross talk across various related domains is gaining momentum. In this backdrop, we have developed a comprehensive ontology on primary and established cell lines-both normal and pathologic. It covers around 400 cell lines. This ontology has been built to include the major domains in the field of biology like anatomy, bio-molecules, chemicals and drugs, pathological conditions and genetic variations around the cell lines. An extensive network of relations has been built across these concepts to enable different combinations of queries. The ontology covers all cell lines from major sources like ATCC, DSMZ, ECACC, ICLC etc. and is built in OWL format.","documentation":null,"publication":null,"publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2014-08-05T00:00:00Z","date_created":"2014-08-05T04:29:27Z","home_page":"http://www.molecularconnections.com","version":"2","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":5475,"nb_individuals":0,"nb_properties":17,"max_depth":9,"max_children":2155,"avg_children":4,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"LIFO","name":"Life Ontology","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":1299,"download_url":"media/ontologies/LIFO/1/lifo.owl","submission_id":1,"domain":null,"description":"The Life Ontology (LifO) is an ontology of the life of organism.

However, a focus on experimental assays in order to describe the whole experimental procedure, to the best of our knowledge, has only been attempted in the context of a very general description based on classical views of the scientific method. In this study, we focus on the development and proposal of an ontology dedicated to the description of these experimental procedures, regardless of the scientific questions that prompted the assays. This ontology includes entities from three distinct realms (biological, physical and data), which include both experimental products, their relations and the protocols describing their manipulation. The final outcome is a useful and comprehensive ontology in the plant domain, to be used as a log book by experimentalists, providing a formal relation between entities.","documentation":null,"publication":null,"publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2014-12-17T00:00:00Z","date_created":"2014-12-17T15:10:11Z","home_page":"https://bitbucket.org/PlantExpAssay/ontology","version":null,"has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":2298,"nb_individuals":1,"nb_properties":74,"max_depth":9,"max_children":75,"avg_children":4,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"PECO","name":"Plant Experimental Conditions Ontology","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":4052,"download_url":"media/ontologies/PECO/27/peco.owl","submission_id":27,"domain":"experimental conditions","description":"A structured, controlled vocabulary which describes the treatments, growing conditions, and/or study types used in plant biology experiments.","documentation":null,"publication":null,"publications":[{"id":"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx1152","title":"The Planteome database: an integrated resource for reference ontologies, plant genomics and phenomics."}],"products":[{"id":"peco.owl","ontology_purl":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/peco.owl"},{"id":"peco.obo","ontology_purl":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/peco.obo"}],"taxon":null,"date_released":"2020-11-16T13:16:33.844692Z","date_created":"2020-11-16T13:16:33.844708Z","home_page":"http://planteome.org/","version":null,"has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":3121,"nb_individuals":0,"nb_properties":124,"max_depth":31,"max_children":603,"avg_children":2,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":"72ac980b4e39b45afb3398b8b743c6c4"}},{"acronym":"NCBI_NMOsp_1_0_0","name":"NeuroMorpho.Org Species Ontology v.1.0.0","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":529,"download_url":"media/ontologies/NCBI_NMOsp_1_0_0/1/ncbi_nmosp_1_0_0.obo","submission_id":1,"domain":null,"description":"A lighter version of the NCBI taxonomy that is customized for the NeuroMorpho.Org species.","documentation":null,"publication":null,"publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","date_created":"2010-06-14T02:47:12Z","home_page":"","version":"1","has_ontology_language":"OBO","nb_classes":438,"nb_individuals":0,"nb_properties":0,"max_depth":36,"max_children":51,"avg_children":2,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"ELD","name":"EthiopianListOfDiseases","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":4666,"download_url":"media/ontologies/ELD/5/eld.skos","submission_id":5,"domain":null,"description":"This is the list of Ethiopian Diseases approved by MOH Ethiopia","documentation":null,"publication":null,"publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2021-07-23T00:00:00Z","date_created":"2021-11-01T10:17:06Z","home_page":null,"version":"4","has_ontology_language":"SKOS","nb_classes":2,"nb_individuals":2077,"nb_properties":0,"max_depth":1,"max_children":2,"avg_children":2,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"ELIG","name":"Eligibility Feature Hierarchy","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":579,"download_url":"media/ontologies/ELIG/1/elig.owl","submission_id":1,"domain":null,"description":"We derived a set of 1,437 eligibility features that were organized into a feature hierarchy using 80 breast cancer trials.

Instances of the Document Indexing System have been realised for French, English and Dutch ; (ii) The Consultation System allows users to access the information contained in PDSs previously indexed by the Document Indexing System. The test domain for the project was coronary diseases. The existing prototype shows promising results for information retrieval from natural language PDSs and for automatically encoding PDSs into an existing classification such as ICD-9-CM. A set of components, tools, knowledge bases and methods has also been produced by the project. These include language-independent ontology and models for the domain of coronary diseases; conceptual description of the relevant ICD-9-CM codes.\r\nThis ontology includes a top-ontology, a top-domain ontology and a domain ontology (Coronay diseases surgery).

WSIO is however independent of the application domain and relevant for both SOAP and REST Web services, and for batch execution engines in general. If the interaction scenario with a Web service is nontrivial (and incorporates session handling), annotation with WSIO concepts will enable automatic generation of client programs, scripts, or interactive applications with a graphical user interface. WSIO also enables automation of different ways of data transfer and data un-/compression or en-/decoding. We strongly discourage providers from developing complex interaction and data-transfer/compression scenarios, however when needed, WSIO may enable smooth automated interaction with them. Future versions will support more interaction scenarios. WSIO aims to serve also as a means to standardise the complex interaction scenarios primarily within both SOAP and REST Web services, and secondarily to apply also to batch execution infrastructure in

The Society encourages the free flow of information between its members and interested groups, through workshop meetings and teaching programs, and by the dissemination of a classification scheme and pertinent scientific data.\r\n\r\nThe updated classification was approved at the May, 2018 General Assembly in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and can be found at https://www.issva.org/classification.\r\n\r\nWhat is the ISSVA Ontology?\r\n\r\nThe ISSVA ontology has been created to represent a sharable semantic data model of the ISSVA classification. This ontological representation of the ISSVA classification is machine-readable and facilitates interoperability between systems that capture data about vascular anomalies. It is structured hierarchically and contains all concepts of the ISSVA classification and the relationships between them. The ontology is available in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) format, and can be browsed and downloaded online: https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ISSVA\r\n\r\nHow to Use the ISSVA Ontology?\r\n\r\nThe ISSVA ontology does not substitute the ISSVA classification, instead, it should be used as an additional component to facilitate interoperability. Every concept in the ISSVA ontology has a unique code that should be attached to the corresponding data element. In the context of databases, the ISSVA ontology codes could be added as an extra column to the existing data. \r\n\r\nMappings to Other Ontologies?\r\n\r\nThe ISSVA ontology contains machine-readable mappings to equivalent concepts in other ontologies, namely: the Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO), SNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), National Cancer Institute thesaurus (NCIT), and the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). This means that data annotated with codes from the ISSVA ontology are interoperable with data annotated with the aforementioned ontologies, without any extra effort, as long as there exists a mapping between the concepts.\r\n\r\nIssue Reporting\r\n\r\nPlease contact ISSVA at info@issva.org in case you have any issues and/or feature requests for the ISSVA ontology. The ontology can then be updated accordingly.","documentation":"https://github.com/brunasv/ISSVA","publication":null,"publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2021-02-19T00:00:00Z","date_created":"2021-04-29T16:05:21Z","home_page":"https://www.issva.org","version":"1.1.3","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":194,"nb_individuals":5,"nb_properties":1,"max_depth":8,"max_children":40,"avg_children":6,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"MO","name":"Microarray and Gene Expression Data Ontology","status":"Unloadable","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":291,"download_url":"media/ontologies/MO/1/mo.owl","submission_id":1,"domain":null,"description":"Concepts, definitions, terms, and resources for standardized description of a microarray experiment in support of MAGE v.1.","documentation":"http://mged.sourceforge.net/software/downloads.php","publication":null,"publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2015-08-19T00:00:00Z","date_created":"2009-05-21T17:24:23Z","home_page":"http://mged.sourceforge.net/ontologies/MGEDontology.php","version":"1.3.1.1","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":236,"nb_individuals":698,"nb_properties":127,"max_depth":8,"max_children":31,"avg_children":5,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"NPOKB","name":"Neuron Phenotype Ontology","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":5275,"download_url":"media/ontologies/NPOKB/6/npokb.owl","submission_id":6,"domain":null,"description":"An ontology of neuron types based on the phenotypic dimensions of cells that can be measure experimentally.","documentation":"https://github.com/SciCrunch/NIF-Ontology/blob/master/docs/Neurons.md","publication":null,"publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2022-08-08T01:16:12Z","date_created":"2022-08-08T01:16:21Z","home_page":"https://github.com/SciCrunch/NIF-Ontology","version":"2022-08-05","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":5309,"nb_individuals":91,"nb_properties":76,"max_depth":36,"max_children":1327,"avg_children":5,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"NMOSP","name":"NeuroMorpho.Org species ontology","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":883,"download_url":"media/ontologies/NMOSP/18/nmosp.owl","submission_id":18,"domain":null,"description":"The species ontology of NeuroMorpho.Org was updated (OntoSearch v1.3) to map the new species and strains added in  NeuroMorpho.Org v6.3 release.","documentation":null,"publication":null,"publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2017-11-28T02:12:14Z","date_created":"2017-11-28T02:12:14Z","home_page":"NeuroMorpho.Org","version":"1.3","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":1562,"nb_individuals":191,"nb_properties":0,"max_depth":40,"max_children":408,"avg_children":3,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"MPO","name":"Microbial Phenotype Ontology","status":"Unloadable","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":382,"download_url":"media/ontologies/MPO/7/mpo.owl","submission_id":7,"domain":null,"description":"An ontology for describing microbial phenotypes","documentation":null,"publication":null,"publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2014-02-20T00:00:00Z","date_created":"2014-02-20T08:59:20Z","home_page":null,"version":"Version 0.5 alpha","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":337,"nb_individuals":120,"nb_properties":132,"max_depth":8,"max_children":24,"avg_children":4,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"OF","name":"OntoFood","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":641,"download_url":"media/ontologies/OF/1/of.owl","submission_id":1,"domain":null,"description":"This is an ontology with SWRL rules of nutrition for diabetic patient.
