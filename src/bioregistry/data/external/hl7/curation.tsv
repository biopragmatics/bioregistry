1.0.21000.6	Complete	iso21000-6-2004E-RDD	ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004(E) Rights Data Dictionary	http://iso21000-6.net/	ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004 describes a Rights Data Dictionary which comprises a set of clear, consistent, structured, integrated and uniquely identified terms to support the MPEG-21 Rights Expression Language (REL), ISO/IEC 21000-5. Annex A specifies the methodology for and structure of the RDD Dictionary, and specifies how further Terms may be defined under the governance of a Registration Authority, requirements for which are described in Annex C.Taken together, these specifications and the RDD Dictionary and Database make up the RDD System. Use of the RDD System will facilitate the accurate exchange and processing of information between interested parties involved in the administration of rights in, and use of, Digital Items, and in particular it is intended to support ISO/IEC 21000-5 (REL). Clause 6 describes how ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004 relates to ISO/IEC 21000-5.As well as providing definitions of terms for use in ISO/IEC 21000-5, the RDD System is designed to support the mapping of terms from different namespaces. Such mapping will enable the transformation of metadata from the terminology of one namespace (or Authority) into that of another namespace. Mapping, to ensure minimum ambiguity or loss of semantic integrity, will be the responsibility of the Registration Authority. Provision of automated trm look-up is also a requirement.The RDD Dictionary is a prescriptive dctionary, in the sense that it defines a single meaning for a trm represented by a particular RddAuthorized TermName, but it is also inclusive in that it can recognize the prescription of other Headwords and definitions by other Authorities and incorporates them through mappings. The RDD Dictionary also supports the circumstance that the same name may have different meanings under different Authorities. ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004describes audit provisions so that additions, amendments and deletions to Terms and their attributes can be tracked.ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004 recognizes legal definitions as and only as Terms from other Authorities that can be mapped into the RDD Dictionary. Therefore Terms that are directly authorized by the RDD Registration Authority neither define nor prescribe intellectual property rights or other legal entities.

1.0.639.1	Complete	iso639-1	ISO 639-1: Codes for the representation of names of languages -- Part 1: Alpha-2 code	http://www.iso.org/iso/home.htm	This part of ISO 639 provides a code consisting of language code elements comprising two-letter language identifiers for the representation of names of languages. The language identifiers according to this part of ISO 639 were devised originally for use in terminology, lexicography and linguistics, but may be adopted for any application requiring the expression of language in two-letter coded form, especially in computerized systems. The alpha-2 code was devised for practical use for most of the major languages of the world that are not only most frequently represented in the total body of the world's literature, but which also comprise a considerable volume of specialized languages and terminologies. Additional language identifiers are created when it becomes apparent that a significant body of documentation written in specialized languages and terminologies exists. Languages designed exclusively for machine use, such as computer-programming languages, are not included in this code.The code set is available from http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=22109&ICS1=1&ICS2=140&ICS3=20

This has been superceded by ISO 639-3 for many purposes.  ISO 639-2 was released in 1998.  The code set is available from http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=4767
1.0.639.3	Complete	iso639-3	ISO 639-3 Language Codes Alpha 3	http://www.sil.org/ISO639-3/	ISO 639-3 is a code that aims to define three-letter identifiers for all known human languages. At the core of ISO 639-3 are the individual languages already accounted for in ISO 639-2. The large number of living languages in the initial inventory of ISO 639-3 beyond those already included in ISO 639-2 was derived primarily from Ethnologue (15th edition). Additional extinct, ancient, historic, and constructed languages have been obtained from Linguist List.SIL International has been designated as the ISO 639-3/RA for the purpose of processing requests for alpha-3 language codes comprising the International Standard, Codes for the representation of names of languages - Part 3: Alpha-3 code for comprehensive coverage of languages. The ISO 639-3/RA receives and reviews applications for requesting new language codes and for the change of existing ones according to criteria indicated in the standard. It maintains an accurate list of information associated with registered language codes which can be viewed on or downloaded from this website, and processes updates of registered language codes. Notification of pending and adopted updates are also distributed on a regular basis to subscribers and other parties.

The purpose and scope of the PathLex project is very similar to those of the RadLex project in the radiology domain. The Pathlex project has been designed to satisfy the needs of Anatomic Pathology information system vendors and users by adopting the best features of existing terminology systems, while producing new terms to fill critical gaps. Rather than re-inventing the wheel, PathLex unifies and supplements other terminology systems, such as SNOMED-CT, CIM-O or various vocablary tables defined by DICOM and HL7.

2.16.840.1.113883.3.567.12.1	Complete	fdbMEDID	fdb Medication ID	http://www.firstdatabank.com/	"An eight-character numeric column that identifies the unique combination of product or generic name, route of administration, dosage form, strength, and strength unit-of-measure. It is the most specific name concept in NDDF Plus. This number is a stable identifier.Examples of its use include outpatient prescribing and patient medication profiling. In contrast to the inpatient setting, outpatient prescribing must be specific as to dosage form and strength. Attributes of the MEDID provide drug information and access to clinical and patient education modules within NDDF Plus.The fdbMEDID is the primary clinical drug concept distributed by FDB that is used to represent the clinical drug when prescribing, ordering or when generating a list of active patient medications.  It spans both generically named and branded concepts and is very analogous to the RxNorm ""Semantic Brand Drug"" (SBD) and the RxNorm ""Semantic Clinical Drug"". In the context of HL7, the fdbMEDID would most likely be used when compiling a structured medication component for the CCD record.  For stage 1 Meaningful Use, the fdbMEDID may be used to report the coded medication in the absence of an RxNorm code; for stage 2, it is likely that the fdbMEDID will be sent as a ""translation Code"" to represent the code associated to the value selected by the end user in the application as a companion to the ""interoperable Code"" which most likely will be RxNorm based.Within the HL7 CDA Medications Section, the fdbMEDID may be used to identify the enterprise coded medication value used in the context of a ""history of medication use,"" ""medications administered,"" or ""active medications"" (e.g., ""coded product name,"" ""coded brand name"").Within the HL7 CDA Allergy/Drug-Sensitivity Section, may be used to identify the enterprise coded medication value when used in the context of a ""product coded""."
2.16.840.1.113883.3.567.12.2	Complete	fdbMedNameID	fdb Medication Name ID	http://www.firstdatabank.com/	"An eight-character numeric that identifies a unique product or generic name, primarily used for navigational purposes when presenting name concepts to the end user. This number is a stable identifier. It is the most specific name concept in FDB MedKnowledge (NDDF Plus). This number is a stable identifier.Expamples of its use primary use include end user navigation from a text string to orderable or dispensable medication selection targets. Secondly, the fdbMedNameID may be used within proprietary allergy or drug-sensitivity documentation applications in the context of a medication ""allergen.""  For example,the term ""Bactrim"" (fdb MedNameID = 5086) may be selected as a patient medication allergen.  When screening prospective medications for potential allergies, ingredients associated to the fdb MedNameID are fetched in support of allergy detection algorithms.  In the case of ""Bactrim,"" the ingredients ""trimethoprim"" and ""sulfamethoxazole"" would be fetched as related ingredient allergens.For interoperable medication allergen exchange, branded fdbMedNameID values will be cross-referenced to RxNorm Brand Names (example, ""Bactrim"" = RXCUI 151399, Terminology Type = BN); generically named fdbMedNameID values will be linked to RxNorm ingredients (e.g., Ingredient [IN], Precise Ingrdient [PIN] or Multiple Ingredient {MIN]). In the context of HL7, the fdbMedNameID would most likely be used when compiling a structured medication allergen within the Allergy Observation for a CDA document.  Within the United States, it is expected that for brand-name based medication allergens, the RxNorm Brand Name would be exchanged as the interoperable code and the fdbMedNameID would be included as the ""translation Code"" to represent the code associated to term selected by the end user within FDB supported systems.  For example:<code  code='151399'                displayName='Bactrim'                codeSystem='2.16.840.1.113884.6.88'                codeSystemName='NLM RxNorm'  <translation code='5086'                displayName='Bactrim'                codeSystem='2.16.840.1.113883.3.567.12.2'                codeSystemName='fdbMedNameID'</code>"

2.16.840.1.113883.5.1108	Complete	encode-FM	Electronic Nomenclature and Classification Of Disorders and Encounters for Family Medicine	http://www.insite-fm.com/	"ENCODE-FM is a systematic and hierarchical controlled clinical terminology for family medicine, intended for use in electronic medical records incorporated into the software of any vendor. It was derived from our knowledge of ICPC, ICD-10, and our aggregate 60-year clinical family medicine experience. Development occurred over a period of approximately ten years and was initially presented internationally at the Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care (SCAMC) 1991 under its original name SIN-FM. The product was subsequently enhanced in order to be the standard terminology for the national database of the College of Family Physicians of Canada ""Clinical Practice Management Network"".ENCODE-FM has been designed expressly for use at point of service in primary care. It addresses the issues of ease of data entry and accuracy of aggregate data retrieval in its design, the mapping to other classifications, and choice of words and terms. Published research (use links)(J. Amer. Medical Informatics Assoc. 3(3): 224-233, 1996; J. Amer. Medical Informatics Assoc., Symposium Supplement 1995, Vol 20: 135-139. 1996.) has shown that none of the large nomenclatures (each over 100,000 terms) intended to cover the whole health care system, describe all clinical content or even all diseases. Alternatively, ENCODE-FM was designed to do one part of that task well - namely to be a CLINICAL terminology of ONLY symptoms, complaints, diagnoses, disorders and reasons for encounter for use in primary care electronic records. It is intended to facilitate data entry by the caregiver, and to allow data aggregation by the 3 internationally recognized classifications of disease used most commonly in primary care  ICPC, ICD-10, and ICD09CM.It was also designed to be an evolving terminology, so that as the terminology and usage of medical terms changes, ENCODE can be readily updated with the changes. ENCODE-FM currently contains 9378 terms.http://www.insite-fm.com/Products/ENCODE-FM"

These data elements would be classified by HL7 as “observations”. The taxonomy is  multi-axial. It consists of 12 domains and 36 classes. All domains and classes are defined. There are 7 axes with definitions for each. Each nursing diagnosis consists of: a concept label or term expressed as a noun or a noun phrase; a definition of the term; a set of defining characteristics (signs and symptoms) of the diagnostic term; an approved list of modifiers of the term; a set of risk factors with definitions; and a set of related factors (or etiologies) for the term.  The system preserves semantics by having robust review procedures and policies to ensure against semantic drift in the meanings of the encoded terms over time. NANDA as an organization is committed to updating the terminology on a regular biannual basis. 	NANDA has been in existence since 1973 and is thus the oldest developer of standardized language in nursing. Most other nursing language systems use many of the older NANDA terms in their vocabularies. The express purpose of the organization is to develop a comprehensive standardized nursing language that captures the conclusions that nurses make based on observations – in effect, the nursing diagnoses. The work is a continuing effort and diagnoses are revised, retired or added bi-annually. The codes are simple integers and are not linked to each other. If a diagnostic term is retired, the code is also retired. If a new diagnosis is added a new code is given to that term. If a diagnostic term is revised, the code is kept intact but the date of the revision is published alongside the term. Domains and classes are not coded."

The CCC System consists of two interrelated terminologies: CCC of 176 Nursing Diagnoses( which includes 528 CCC Nursing Outcomes from each nursing diagnoses combined with one of three qualifiers (Improved, stanbilized, or deteriorated) to document the expected or actual outcomes). The second terminology is the CCC of 804 Nursing Interventions which represents 201 Core Nursing Interventions each of which has to be combined with one of four Action Type Qualifiers (Assess/Monitor; Perform/Care. Teach/Instruct, or Manage/Refer).  Both of the terminologies are classified by 21 Care Components to form a single system.  The CCC System consists of a four level structure designed to document nursing practice following the six steps of the nursing process as recommended by the American Nurses Assocation (ANA) as professional nursing practice and for documenting the 'essence of care'. The ANA recognized the CCC System as early as 1992 and was one of the four earliest nursing terminologies designed to document nursing practice electronically in any healthcare setting where nurses function e.g. hospitals, outpatient departments, home health agencies, ambulatory care clinics, and other health care settings. The CCC System was the first nursing terminology to be recognized by the Secretary of HHS as interoperable and usable for documenting in the electronic health record systems. It is available as a free terminology with Permission -- fomr found on its web Site.

The current list of ABC Codabar blood product codes is published by AABB (formerly American Association of Blood Banks). This list of blood product codes is no longer regularly maintained, and is incomplete according to current blood banking practice standards. It is intended to be replaced throughout the blood banking industry by the newer coding system ISBT 128. In some cases, however, the older ABC Codabar identifiers may still be issued and therefore may be required to be used in blood bank messaging (V2, V3) or hemovigilance reporting (CDA).

ISCN specifies the nomenclature to describe karyotypes, chromosome abnormalities, in situ hybridization, etc. ISCN provides a list of symbols and abbreviated terms in adjunction with a set of rules, which can be used in the description of chromosomes and chromosome abnormalities, such as p for short arm of chromosome, q for long arm of chromosome, cen for centromere, del for deletion, ish for in situ hybridization, and plus sign (+) for gain, etc. A LOINC code is created to represent ""chromosome analysis results in ISCN expression"". In HL7 v2 messages, this LOINC code is used in OBX-3 with a coded result (CWE data type) that will be sent in OBX-5. The value of the coded result is an ISCN expression, and ISCN will be the code system for the coded result. Versioning is identified by the year of publication of the ISCN. The latest version is ISCN 2009. Previous publications include ISCN 2005, ISCN 1995, and ISCN 1985, etc."

The AHA's Health Data Management Group serves as chair and secretary to the NUBC.  NUBC includes the participation of all the major national provider and payer organizations. The NUBC was formed to develop a single billing form and standard data set that could be used nationwide by institutional providers and payers for handling health care claims, the current UB-04 manual.In determining the data to be included, the NUBC strives to balance the need for the information against the burden of providing that information. In essence it applies the administrative simplification principles mentioned in the recently enacted Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Data elements identified as necessary for claims processing are, in most cases, assigned designated spaces on the form. The designated spaces are referred to as Form Locators and each one has a unique number. The current UB-04 data specifications manual seeks to identify the national requirements for preparing Medicare, Medicaid, OCHAMPUS, BCBS, and commercial insurance claims.

CMS released the proposed OPPS rules using the Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC) system in the September 8, 1998 Federal Register. Final regulations were published in the April 7, 2000 Federal Register and the system became effective for Medicare on August 1, 2000.The APC-based OPPS developed by CMS is the outpatient equivalent of the inpatient, DRG-based PPS. The APC system establishes groups of covered services so that the services within each group are comparable clinically and with respect to the use of resources.Hospitals are required to use HCPCS when billing for outpatient services.The OCE not only identifies individual errors but also indicates what actions should be taken and the reasons why these actions are necessary. In order to accommodate this functionality, the OCE is structured to return lists of edit numbers. This structure facilitates the linkage between the actions being taken, the reasons for the actions and the information on the claim (e.g., a specific diagnosis) that caused the action. In general, the OCE performs all functions that require specific reference to HCPCS codes, HCPCS modifiers and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes (ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for historical claims with From Dates prior to 10/1/2015). Since these coding systems are complex and annually updated, the centralization of the direct reference to these codes and modifiers in a single program reduces effort and reduces the chance of inconsistent processing.This is a CMS maintained list of edits: Please see the following for additional information: &#8226;	https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/OutpatientCodeEdit/index.html&#8226;	https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/OutpatientCodeEdit/Background.htmlC&#8226;	https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/OutpatientCodeEdit/OCEQtrReleaseSpecs.htmlThese fields are used in grouping and reimbursement for CMS APCs.

It includes most known genetic and clinical diseases. It was derived from the NIH Genetic Testing Registry (GTR), UMLS, HPO, Orphanet, ClinVar and other sources, and is probably the most complete compendium of genetic diseases, though it also includes most common clinical diseases. It uses UMLS IDs when they exist and its own ID when not, and links to SNOMED CT and other identifiers. The MedGen data base includes the inheritance and clinical features of each disease, as well as the map location of underlying genetic basis.

2.16.840.1.113883.6.341	Complete	hlaAllele	Human leukocyte antigen nomenclature	https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/	Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex contains more than 220 genes that encode for the proteins of the immune system. HLA alleles are most commonly used for histocompatibility testing for stem cell and solid organ transplantation. The WHO Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA System is responsible for a common nomenclature of HLA alleles, allele sequences, and quality control, to communicate histocompatibility typing information to match donors and recipients.  For the full specification, please go to this website: http://hla.alleles.org/nomenclature/naming.html .HLA nomenclature can also be used to represent sets of alleles that share sequence identity in the Antigen Recognition Site (ARS).  G-groups are alleles that have identical DNA sequences in the ARS, while P-groups are alleles that have identical protein sequences in the ARS. These are described, respectively, in http://hla.alleles.org/alleles/g_groups.html and http://hla.alleles.org/alleles/p_groups.html.
2.16.840.1.113883.6.342	Complete	starAllele	Pharmacogenomics star allele nomenclature	https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/	"The star allele nomenclature is commonly used in pharmacogenomics as shorthand to specify one or more specific variants in a gene that is known to impact drug metabolism or response. A star allele can identify either a single variant or a group of variants found in cis, and therefore it usually represents a haplotype. A star allele name is composed of the gene symbol and an allele number, separated by an asterisk, e.g. TPMT*2. By convention, the *1 allele represents the allele that contains the ""reference"" sequence, although that is not true in all cases.  Closely related alleles may be assigned a common number and be differentiated by a unique letter that specifies the suballele (e.g., TPMT*3A, TPMT*3B).   Pharmacogenomics tests commonly report patient phenotypes as diplotypes, i.e. *1/*3A."
