ABD	Anthology of Biosurveillance Diseases	http://brd.bsvgateway.org/disease	Our disease ontology provides information on infectious diseases, disease synonyms, transmission pathways, disease agents, affected populations and disease properties. Diseases have been grouped into syndromic disease categories, such that programmers can look through relevant categories, as well as at specific diseases. Organisms, linked to both agents and populations, are structured hierarchically, to provide multiple levels of organism resolution. In addition, both disease transmission and relevant disease properties are available to search. Disease properties include tags like 'notifiable diseases' and 'economic importance' to flag particular disease characteristics that may be of interest, but are not captured elsewhere.

ADMO	Alzheimer Disease Map Ontology		Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiology is still imperfectly understood and current paradigms have not led to curative outcome. Omics technologies offer great promises for improving our understanding and generating new hypotheses. However, integration and interpretation of such data pose major challenges, calling for adequate knowledge models. AlzPathway is a disease map that gives a detailed and broad account of AD pathophysiology. However, AlzPathway lacks formalism, which can lead to ambiguity and misinterpretation. Ontologies are an adequate framework to overcome this limitation, through their axiomatic definitions and logical reasoning prop-erties. We introduce the AD Map Ontology (ADMO), an ontological upper model based on systems biology terms. We then propose to convert AlzPathway into an ontology and to integrate it into ADMO.

AHOL	Animal Health Ontology for Livestock	http://147.99.156.182/ontologies/visualisation/ontologie/	AHOL (Animal Health Ontology for Livestock) is an ontology of characteristics defining health issues of livestock in their environment (EOL) linked to their phenotypes (ATOL). AHOL aims to: - provide a reference ontology of health traits of farm animals for the international scientific and educational - communities, farmers, etc.; - deliver this reference ontology in a language which can be used by computers in order to support database management, semantic analysis and modeling; - represent traits as generic as possible for livestock vertebrates; - make the AHOL ontology as operational as possible and closely related to measurement techniques; - structure the ontology in relation to animal production
AHSO	Animal Health Surveillance Ontology	http://datadrivensurveillance.org/ahso	(Work in progress - please contact ahso@datadrivensurveillance.org before using this ontology) This is an ontology for health surveillance, assuming that surveillance data is recorded at three main levels: SAMPLE data - data about specific collected samples; OBSERVATIONS, which can aggregate several samples; and OBSERVATIONAL CONTEXT, which is the context in which the observations were made (for instance clinical observation, surveillance sampling, etc). HEALTH EVENT is the occurrence in the real World to be modeled. This occurrence is an abstract concept, as it generally cannot be determined what are its boundaries in time, space, or population units. We assume that several OBSERVATIONS are derived from each health event, and recorded in the same or different databases - for instance clinical journal, laboratory database, abattoir. At the same time or not. AHSO attempts to model these time specific observations. The ontology is focused on the modeling of the animal and health information connected to a single observation, made at a specific point on time. All the information recorded is relative to that specific point in time. For instance, an animal belongs to a herd, which belongs to an owner, AT THE TIME OF THE OBSERVATION. We do not attempt to model how that animal changed herds on time. Similarly, we do not model clinical progression. It is up to those using the data to create definitions of when two observations should be connected to the same event.

BAO-GPCR	G Protein-Coupled Receptor BioAssays Ontology	http://www.bioassayontology.org/	The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) ontology (http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao_gpcr) describes pharmacology, biochemistry and physiology of these important and therapeutically promising class of academic and pharmaceutical research targets. Incorporation and comparison of various small molecule screening data sets, such as those deposited in PubChem, ChEMBL, KEGG, PDSP, and/or IUPHAR databases, requires a formalized electronic organization system. In order to bridge the gap between the overflow of HTS data and the bottleneck of integrated analysis tools, herein, we provide the first comprehensive GPCR ontology. The development and utility of GPCR ontology was based on previously developed BioAssay Ontology (BAO). The GPCR ontology contains information about biochemical, pharmacological, and functional properties of individual GPCRs as well as GPCR-selective ligands inclusive of their HTS screening results and other records. This provides the first all-inclusive GPCR ontology with all available data to model the relationship between the GPCR binding sites and their physiologic and pharmacologic role in physiology via small molecule chemical structures. We developed this system using emerging semantic technologies, by leveraging existing and descriptive domain level ontologies.

BIM	Biomedical Image Ontology	https://sites.google.com/site/bimontology/	Biomedical images published within the scientific literature play a central role in reporting and facilitating life science discoveries. Existing ontologies and vocabularies describing biomedical images, particularly sequence images, do not provide sufficient semantic representation for image annotations generated automatically and/or semi-automatically. We present an open ontology for the annotation of biomedical images (BIM) scripted in OWL/RDF. The BIM ontology provides semantic vocabularies to describe the manually curated image annotations as well as annotations generated by online bioinformatics services using content extracted from images by the Semantic Enrichment of Biomedical Images (SEBI) system. The BIM ontology is represented in three parts; (i) image vocabularies - which holds vocabularies for the annotation of an image and/or region of interests (ROI) inside an image, as well as vocabularies to represent the pre and post processing states of an image, (ii) text entities - covers annotations from the text that are associated with an image (e.g. image captions) and provides semantic representation for NLP algorithm outputs, (iii) a provenance model - that contributes towards the maintenance of annotation versioning. To illustrate the BIM ontology’s utility, we provide three annotation cases generated by BIM in conjunction with the SEBI image annotation engine.

BTO_ONTOLOGY	Brain Tumour Ontology	https://github.com/subhashishhh/BTO-Ontology/blob/master/BrainTumour_ontology.owl	The purpose of this work is to develop an ontology-based framework for developing an information retrieval system to cater to specific queries of users. For creating such an ontology, information was obtained from a wide range of information sources involved with brain tumour study and research. The information thus obtained was compiled and analysed to provide a standard, reliable and relevant information base to aid our proposed system. Facet-based methodology has been used for ontology formalization for quite some time. Ontology formalization involves different steps such as identification of the terminology, analysis, synthesis, standardization and ordering. A vast majority of the ontologies being developed nowadays lack flexibility. This becomes a formidable constraint when it comes to interoperability. We found that a facet-based method provides a distinct guideline for the development of a robust and flexible model concerning the domain of brain tumours. Our attempt has been to bridge library and information science and computer science, which itself involved an experimental approach. It was discovered that a faceted approach is really enduring, as it helps in the achievement of properties like navigation, exploration and faceted browsing. Computer-based brain tumour ontology supports the work of researchers towards gathering information on brain tumour research and allows users across the world to intelligently access new scientific information quickly and efficiently.

For example, the animal GPS collar tracks an elephant and records its geo-location observations for different and equally spaced time intervals and temperature every specified time interval. We adopted classes and properties from SOSA and BBC wildlife ontologies to model the domain coverage."

HNS	HNS_Ontolgoy	https://github.com/subhashishhh/HNS-Ontology/blob/master/HNS_ontology.owl	The purpose of this research is to develop an ontology with subsequent testing and evaluation, for identifying utility and value. The domain that has been chosen is human nervous system (HNS) disorders. It is hypothesized here that an ontology-based patient records management system is more effective in meeting and addressing complex information needs of health-care personnel. Therefore, this study has been based on the premise that developing an ontology and using it as a component of the search interface in hospital records management systems will lead to more efficient and effective management of health-care. It is proposed here to develop an ontology of the domain of HNS disorders using a standard vocabulary such as MeSH or SNOMED CT. The principal classes of an ontology include facet analysis for arranging concepts based on their common characteristics to build mutually exclusive classes. We combine faceted theory with description logic, which helps us to better query and retrieve data by implementing an ontological model. Protégé 5.2.0 was used as ontology editor. The use of ontologies for domain modelling will be of acute help to doctors for searching patient records. In this paper we show how the faceted approach helps us to build a flexible model and retrieve better information. We use the medical domain as a case study to show examples and implementation.

HUPSON	Human Physiology Simulation Ontology	http://www.scai.fraunhofer.de/en/business-research-areas/bioinformatics/downloads.html	Large biomedical simulation initiatives, such as the Virtual Physiological Human (VPH), are substantially dependent on controlled vocabularies to facilitate the exchange of information, of data and of models. Hindering these initiatives is a lack of a comprehensive ontology that covers the essential concepts of the simulation domain. We propose a first version of a newly constructed ontology, HuPSON, as a basis for shared semantics and interoperability of simulations, of models, of algorithms and of other resources in this domain. The ontology is based on the Basic Formal Ontology, and adheres to the MIREOT principles.
HUSAT	HuBMAP Samples Added Terms		This is a template of terminologies in the Sample Data v2b Spreadsheet that did not already exist in BioPortal.
I-ADOPT	I-ADOPT Framework Ontology	https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/interoperable-descriptions-observable-property-terminology-wg-i-adopt-wg/wiki/i-adopt-0	The I-ADOPT Framework is an ontology designed to facilitate interoperability between existing variable description models (including ontologies, taxonomy, and structured controlled vocabularies). One of the challenges in representing semantic descriptions of variables is getting people to agree about what they mean when describing the components that define the variables. The I-ADOPT ontology addresses this by providing core components and their relations that can be applied to define machine-interpretable variable descriptions that re-use FAIR vocabulary terms. This first version of the ontology has been developed by a core group of terminology experts and users from the Research Data Alliance (RDA) InteroperAble Descriptions of Observable Property Terminology (I-ADOPT) Working Group.

One of such controlled vocabulary is Wind Energy Taxonomy of Models. This taxonomy is the result of EERA JP WIND IRPWind Open Data initiative that took place in 2017 in which wind energy experts generated the first version of the taxonomy as an input for defining and structuring wind energy metadata. The report of this work is available at Zenodo: https://www.zenodo.org/record/1199489#.XSD6haeQ3RY In 2018, the taxonomy of topics was improved during the internal project of DTU Wind Energy titled 'FAIR Digitalization': https://www.zenodo.org/record/1493874#.XSD7TaeQ3RY In 2021, the taxonomy was converted into FAIR machine-actionable controlled vocabulary using sheet2rdf. The controlled vocabulary is served to humans and machines using an instace of OntoStack hosted by DTU Wind Energy. sheet2rdf and OntoStack are developed by FAIR Data Collective. Additionally, in 2021, the persistent URL purl.org/idem has been registered for the taxonomy. This allows us to: If there is a needed to move the taxonomy to another domain (currently under data.windenergy.dtu.dk) URLs will be still resolvable and unchanged Use short URls as PIDs for the taxonomy terms and properties.

ILLNESSINJURY	Illness and Injury		"This list of Illness and Injury (Morbidity and Mortality) classifications is an abbreviated version of the World Health Organization's (WHO) Startup Mortality List (ICD-10-SMoL). ICD-10-SMoL is the WHO's application of ICD-10 for low-resource settings initial cause of death collection. ICD-10-SMoL was chosen because it is a simplified version of the ICD-10. ICD (International Classification of Diseases) ""is the foundation for the identification of health trends and statistics globally, and the international standard for reporting diseases and health conditions. It is the diagnostic classification standard for all clinical and research purposes. ICD defines the universe of diseases, disorders, injuries and other related health conditions"" [http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/]. Version 1.0 of this ontology was compiled for the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory (CWRC) ontology project and reflects the need to have causes of death and health issues organized in a way to allow for analysis of cultural data. A simplified list was deemed sufficient since the domain under study (cultural documents) will not have detailed medical information with regards to cause of death or health issues. But instead of accepting a list of general usage terms for causes of death or health issues that appear in some sources (e.g. Wikipedia, Wikidatak, etc.), a standardized, medical classification was selected so that it could be of use for future analysis regarding questions involving the intersection of health and culture. ICD-10-SMoL was chosen since it was the latest version of this list (June, 2018). A stable version of ICD-11 was to be available in June 2018 but there was no ICD-11-SMoL available at this time. To obtain the ICD10-SMoL: http://www.who.int/healthinfo/civil_registration/ICD_10_SMoL.pdf?ua=1"
IMGT-ONTOLOGY	Immunogenetics Ontology	http://www.imgt.org/	"IMGT-ONTOLOGY is the first ontology for immunogenetics and immunoinformatics. It provides a semantic specification of the terms to be used in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics and manages the related knowledge, thus allowing the standardization for immunogenetics data from genome, proteome, genetics, two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) structures. IMGT-ONTOLOGY manages the knowledge through diverse facets relying on seven axioms, ""IDENTIFICATION"", ""CLASSIFICATION"", ""DESCRIPTION"", ""NUMEROTATION"", ""LOCALIZATION"", ""ORIENTATION"" and ""OBTENTION"". These axioms postulate that any object, any process and any relation can be identified, classified, described, numbered, localized and orientated, and the way it is obtained can be characterized. The axioms constitute the Formal IMGT-ONTOLOGY, also designated as IMGT-Kaleidoscope. As the same axioms can be used to generate concepts for multi-scale level approaches, the Formal IMGT-ONTOLOGY represents a paradigm for system biology ontologies, which need to identify, to classify, to describe, to number, to localize and to orientate objects, processes and relations at the molecule, cell, tissue, organ, organism or population levels. IMGT®, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system®, has been built on IMGT-ONTOLOGY. The version 1.0.3 of IMGT-ONTOLOGY includes the concepts of IDENTIFICATION and an update of the concepts of CLASSIFICATION."

INFECTION_TRANS	Infection Transmission Ontology	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UtrechtUniversity/summer-fair/master/src/create_ontology/map_ontology/infection_trans.owl#	The Infection Transmission Ontology is developed in order to make transmission data reusable and interoperable. The ontology captures every step of analysing data from the transmission process, especially for quantification of trans- mission parameters. It is applicable to animal and human (hospital) data from both experimental and observational stud- ies. The lack of a common terminology in the infection transmission experiments leads to repetition of costly experiments.

ISO-FOOD	A formal representation of the knowledge within the domain of Isotopes for Food Science	http://cs.ijs.si/repository/ISO-FOOD/ISO-FOOD_Ontology.zip	To link and harmonize different knowledge repositories with respect to isotopic data, we propose an ISO-FOOD ontology as a domain ontology for describing isotopic data within Food Science. The ISO-FOOD ontology consists of metadata and provenance data that needs to be stored together with data elements in order to describe isotopic measurements with all necessary information required for future analysis. The new domain has been linked with existing ontologies, such as Units of Measurements Ontology, Food, Nutrient and the Bibliographic Ontology. So linked ontology consists of several superclasses, and for each of these the relevant subclasses, object properties and data properties are defined. To show how such an ontology can be used in practice, it was populated with 20 isotopic measurements of Slovenian food samples. Describing data in this way offers a powerful technique for organizing and sharing stable isotope data across Food Science.

ISO 639-2 contains codes for all languages contained in ISO 639-1 and several hundred additional languages. The ISO 639-2 (Bibliographic) codes were devised for use in bibliographic metadata, e.g., for libraries, information services, and publishers, and ISO 639-2 (Terminology) targets terminology, lexicography, and linguistic applications. The lists are the same except for 20 languages that have different Bibliographic and Terminology codes. The list contains over 500 discrete codes.
ISSVA	International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) Ontology	https://www.issva.org	The International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) is a multidisciplinary international society of physicians, scientists, and health care providers united by an interest in vascular anomalies. The Society aims to promote the highest standards of care for patients with vascular anomalies by advancing clinical and scientific knowledge concerning causes, diagnosis and treatment, and by education of physicians, health care providers, patients and the community. The Society encourages the free flow of information between its members and interested groups, through workshop meetings and teaching programs, and by the dissemination of a classification scheme and pertinent scientific data. The updated classification was approved at the May, 2018 General Assembly in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and can be found at https://www.issva.org/classification. What is the ISSVA Ontology? The ISSVA ontology has been created to represent a sharable semantic data model of the ISSVA classification. This ontological representation of the ISSVA classification is machine-readable and facilitates interoperability between systems that capture data about vascular anomalies. It is structured hierarchically and contains all concepts of the ISSVA classification and the relationships between them. The ontology is available in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) format, and can be browsed and downloaded online: https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ISSVA How to Use the ISSVA Ontology? The ISSVA ontology does not substitute the ISSVA classification, instead, it should be used as an additional component to facilitate interoperability. Every concept in the ISSVA ontology has a unique code that should be attached to the corresponding data element. In the context of databases, the ISSVA ontology codes could be added as an extra column to the existing data. Mappings to Other Ontologies? The ISSVA ontology contains machine-readable mappings to equivalent concepts in other ontologies, namely: the Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO), SNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), National Cancer Institute thesaurus (NCIT), and the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). This means that data annotated with codes from the ISSVA ontology are interoperable with data annotated with the aforementioned ontologies, without any extra effort, as long as there exists a mapping between the concepts. Issue Reporting Please contact ISSVA at info@issva.org in case you have any issues and/or feature requests for the ISSVA ontology. The ontology can then be updated accordingly.

LCGFT	Library of Congress Genre/Form Thesaurus for Library and Archival Materials	http://id.loc.gov/authorities/genreForms.html	"The Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms for Library and Archival Materials (LCGFT) is a thesaurus that describes what a work is versus what it is about. For instance, the subject heading Horror films, with appropriate subdivisions, would be assigned to a book about horror films. A cataloger assigning headings to the movie The Texas Chainsaw Massacre would also use Horror films, but it would be a genre/form term since the movie is a horror film, not a movie about horror films. The thesaurus combines both genres and forms. Form is defined as a characteristic of works with a particular format and/or purpose. A ""short"" is a particular form, for example, as is ""animation."" Genre refers to categories of works that are characterized by similar plots, themes, settings, situations, and characters. Examples of genres are westerns and thrillers. In the term Horror films""horror"" is the genre and ""films"" is the form."

MWLA	Medical Web Lifestyle Aggregator	https://www.carre-project.eu/innovation/web-lifestyle-data-aggregator/	This ontology designed and developed in order to represent the detected intentions from the Web Lifestyle Data Aggregator. In particular, it seeks to represent what is involved in the gathering of data from the web and social lifestyle of user on the Internet. We decided, therefore, to develop the ontology using the Protégé v5.0, a free, open-source ontology editor from the Stanford University. The outcome of Protégé is available on the following URL: http://carre.kmi.open.ac.uk/ontology/lifestyle.owl The presented ontology is generic and can support different type of providers (e.g. web searches, Facebook, Twitter etc.). Additionally, the predefined intentions are also generic supporting the majority of intentions in the Web. In the context of CARRE, we utilize, as a first attempt, the web searches as provider and we only upload the relevant intentions (health and travel) to CARRE in the private RDF repository. A user (representing an individual person whose data is being represented using the terms of this ontology) has connections. A connection represents that a Web Lifestyle Data Aggregator of a particular personal computer of user provides intentions for particulars providers. A connection is therefore associated with a UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) that represents an installation of the aggregator. A provider can be the web searches, Facebook or Twitter. A measurement is associated with a provider and a connection in order to declare the connection (i.e. the Web Lifestyle Data Aggregator of a particular personal computer) from which a measurement came. Every measurement must have a date at which the detected intention was taken, a weight which defines the importance of an intention and of course the detected intention that is only relevant to CARRE.

NCCNEHR	NCCN EHR Oncology Categories	https://www.nccn.org/	The NCCN EHR Oncology Advisory Group was formed to address the high variance in oncology history documentation within EHR systems. Specifically, there is a lack of standardization in the names of oncology history categories across institutions. Moreover, no synonym list or mapping currently exists between the varied category names. Furthermore, oncology history documentation is often inconsistent, incomplete, and not updated appropriately.

NERO	Named Entity Recognition Ontology		Named Entity Recognition Ontology (NERO) developed specifically for describing textual entities in biomedical texts, which accounts for diverse levels of ambiguity, bridging the scientific sublanguages of molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, and medicine. The annotation of natural science texts is more challenging than in other domains. Biomedical language is replete with ambiguity distinct from that observed in news articles or informal text online. In biomedical texts, alternative meanings are not always clearly separated. For example, in some biomedical contexts, the words for a named entity may refer to a gene or a protein with nearly equal probability; for example, “a mutant hemoglobin α_2” can refer to either a gene or a protein. If the author meant gene-or-protein A, and we force an annotator to choose either interpretation gene A or protein A, the resulting annotation is of limited utility because the choice between gene and protein is random if the meanings are equally likely based on context. NERO attempts to minimize unwarranted, arbitrary annotative semantic label assignments for textual entities. NERO defines ambiguous concepts, such as GeneOrProtein, which subsumes both Gene and Protein using the following axiom: EquivalentTo: ‘Gene’ or ‘Protein.’ There are no biological entities that are either a gene or a protein, but there are lexical entities that can correspond to either or both of these entities.

PEAO	Plant Experimental Assay Ontology	https://bitbucket.org/PlantExpAssay/ontology	The Plant domain has been the subject of several attempts to structure and formally define terms and corresponding relations, such as their anatomical features, developmental stages, and the application of particular experimental procedures to a biological problem. However, a focus on experimental assays in order to describe the whole experimental procedure, to the best of our knowledge, has only been attempted in the context of a very general description based on classical views of the scientific method. In this study, we focus on the development and proposal of an ontology dedicated to the description of these experimental procedures, regardless of the scientific questions that prompted the assays. This ontology includes entities from three distinct realms (biological, physical and data), which include both experimental products, their relations and the protocols describing their manipulation. The final outcome is a useful and comprehensive ontology in the plant domain, to be used as a log book by experimentalists, providing a formal relation between entities.

PP	Pipeline Patterns Ontology	https://bitbucket.org/PlantExpAssay/ontology	To answer the need for a workflow representing a sequence of data transformations, a high-level process ontology was defined, denoted Pipeline Patterns (PP) ontology. Every concept is generically a Data (class from EDAM), which can be further specified as an Entry (P:00002) or an Exit (P:00009). All Entries can be subjected to an Operation (class from EDAM) producing an Intermediate (P:00010). An Intermediate has a TemporalEntity associated to represent its time of creation. Some Entries are specifically of the type Exit, meaning that they will represent concepts that exit the current category and be passed to the next one on the workflow. Additionally, in order to permit the treatment of a set of objects as a single entity, this high-level ontology considers the concept of List (P:00004) and more specifically an Aggregate (P:00005), containing a set of Data or Entry, respectively. The concept Intermediate is an Entry, allowing for the successive application of an operation to an Element. This is particularly useful in the case of the application of sequential set of operations.

But the QUDT specification is more than a core architecture and a list of these concepts, because it implements international standards and thus provides the foundation for system interoperability. In order to provide for interoperability and data exchange between information systems, the specification needs to be available in a machine processable form, with no ambiguities. For these reasons, the QUDT approach to specifying these concepts is to use precise semantically grounded specifications in an ontology model with translation into machine-processable representations.

SIMON	Simple Measurement Ontology	https://github.com/mdebellis/SIMON-A-Simple-Measurement-Vocabulary	"The SImple Measurement ONtology (SIMON) is a small vocabulary (3 top level classes: PunnedClass, Measurement, and Unit) to represent measurements and units. It uses the pattern to represent N-ary relations and a recursive structure to make the representation of various measurements and units (e.g., ""5 kilograms"", ""4 miles per hour"", ""5 meters per second per second"" straight forward and obvious. It utilizes the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) to automatically order measurements of the same type (e.g., Speed) regardles of units. E.g., that 5 kilometers per hour is greater than 5 meters per hour. It does this by transforming all measures of a specific type (e.g., distance, mass, speed, acceleration) to canonical units. The canonical units can be modified by changing a few rules. I also include on the github page some SPARQL transformations that generate the rdfs:label for each measurement instance so the developer doesn't have to take the effort and potential error prone risk of doing this manually. The version included here is the version after the SWRL rules have run and with the inferences exported and also after the SPARQL transforms have generated all the rdfs:label values. Although there are other vocabularies that address this problem they are either much more complex (addressing many additional issues besides units and measures) and/or do not automatically order measures of different units."

SNPO	Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Ontology	https://members.loria.fr/ACoulet/files/snpontology1.6_description.html	SNP-Ontology is a domain ontology that provides a formal representation (OWL-DL) of genomic variations. Despite its name, SNP-Ontology, is not limited to the representation of SNPs but it encompasses genomic variations in a broader meaning. SNP-Ontology is general enough to enable the representation of variations observed in genome of various species. Latest versions of SNP-Ontology include the representation of haplotype and of CNV. The unambiguous representation of genomic variations provided by SNP-Ontology enables to integrate heterogeneous data related to genomic variations. To achieve this goal SNP-Ontology enables (1) to represent one variation in accordance with various ways that exist for describing it, (2) to represent the equivalence between two distinct descriptions of one variation, and (3) to represent correspondence between a genomic variation and its outcome at the transcriptome and proteome levels.

TDT	Tour Danau Toba		"Danau Toba merupakan salah satu danau terluas di dunia yakni mencapai 100 km x 30 km yang terbentang di bagian barat daya Provinsi Sumatera Utara. Ada 7 Kabupaten yang menjadi stake holder danau toba setelah terlaksananya pemekaran sejak tahun 2000. Di tengah Danau Toba sendiri terdapat pulau yang cukup luas bernama Pulau Samosir. Pulau Samosir sendiri merupakan sebuah Kabupaten yang langsung berbatasan dengan Kabupaten Dairi di sebelah utara. Media transportasi umum untuk menghubungkan pulau dengan daratan dipergunakan kapal motor untuk umum seperti halnya Angkutan Kota (Angkot) di daratan. Namun ini tidak terlalu banyak karena memang pelabuhan di darat juga tidak begitu banyak. Sisanya adalah kapal ferry. Kapal motor umum yang paling lancar adalah lintas Tomok - Tigaraja - Tomok. Anda tidak akan kesulitan untuk menaiki kapal motor umum dari parapat menuju Tomok dan Ambarita. Selalu ada setiap penumpang sudah penuh. Peserta <a href=""https://wisatamurahmeriah.com"">paket wisata danau toba</a> yang ingin menyeberang ke Pulau Samosir untuk group kecil menggunakan kapal motor umum tersebut, sedangkan untuk group menggunakan kapal carter dari Parapat. Selain kapal motor, di Danau Toba terdapat beberapa terminal ferry yang mengangkut barang dan penumpang umum termasuk turis yang berwisata mengikuti <a href=""https://wisatamurahmeriah.com"">paket tour danau toba</a>.

TOP-MENELAS	Menelas Project Top-Level Ontology		The two main goals MENELAS contributes to are to (i) Provide better account of and better access to medical information through natural languages in order to help physicians in their daily practice, and to (ii) Enhance European cooperation by multilingual access to standardised medical nomenclatures. The major achievements of MENELAS are the realisation of its two functional systems: (i) The Document Indexing System encodes free text PDSs into both an internal representation (a set of Conceptual Graphs) and international nomenclature codes (ICD-9-CM). Instances of the Document Indexing System have been realised for French, English and Dutch ; (ii) The Consultation System allows users to access the information contained in PDSs previously indexed by the Document Indexing System. The test domain for the project was coronary diseases. The existing prototype shows promising results for information retrieval from natural language PDSs and for automatically encoding PDSs into an existing classification such as ICD-9-CM. A set of components, tools, knowledge bases and methods has also been produced by the project. These include language-independent ontology and models for the domain of coronary diseases; conceptual description of the relevant ICD-9-CM codes. This ontology includes a top-ontology, a top-domain ontology and a domain ontology (Coronay diseases surgery). The menelas-top ontology here is the part of the whole ontology without any reference to medical domain.

WHO-ART	World Health Organization (WHO) Adverse Reaction Terminology	http://www.who.int/	WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology, 1997
WSIO	Web-Service Interaction Ontology	http://wsio.org	Web Service Interaction Ontology (WSIO) enables automated interaction with more complex Web services that are typical for example within life sciences. WSIO is however independent of the application domain and relevant for both SOAP and REST Web services, and for batch execution engines in general. If the interaction scenario with a Web service is nontrivial (and incorporates session handling), annotation with WSIO concepts will enable automatic generation of client programs, scripts, or interactive applications with a graphical user interface. WSIO also enables automation of different ways of data transfer and data un-/compression or en-/decoding. We strongly discourage providers from developing complex interaction and data-transfer/compression scenarios, however when needed, WSIO may enable smooth automated interaction with them. Future versions will support more interaction scenarios. WSIO aims to serve also as a means to standardise the complex interaction scenarios primarily within both SOAP and REST Web services, and secondarily to apply also to batch execution infrastructure in general.
