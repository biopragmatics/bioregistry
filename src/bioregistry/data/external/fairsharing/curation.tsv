FAIRsharing.0A9kNV	FAIR Metrics - Use FAIR Vocabularies	FM-I2	FM-I2 is a metric concerning whether the metadata values and qualified relations of a resource are themselves FAIR, for example, terms from open, community-accepted vocabularies published in an appropriate knowledge-exchange format. It is not possible to unambiguously interpret metadata represented as simple keywords or other non-qualified symbols. For interoperability, it must be possible to identify data that can be integrated like-with-like. This requires that the data, and the provenance descriptors of the data, should (where reasonable) use vocabularies and terminologies that are, themselves, FAIR. As such, IRIs representing the vocabularies used for (meta)data must be provided. This metric applies to part I2 of the FAIR Principles.

FAIRsharing.1y63n8	MorphoBank	MorphoBank	MorphoBank provides a digital archive of biodiversity and evolutionary research data, specifically systematics (the science of determining the evolutionary relationships among species). MorphoBank aids development of the Tree of Life - the genealogy of all living and extinct species. Heritable features - both genotypes (e.g., DNA sequences) and phenotypes (e.g., anatomy, behavior, physiology) are stored as part of the Tree of Life project. While the genomic part of this work is archived at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), MorphoBank is part of the infrastructure for storing and sharing phenotype data, including information on anatomy, physiology, behavior and other features of species. One can think of MorphoBank as two databases in one: one that permits researchers to upload images and affiliate data with those images (labels, species names, etc.) and a second database that allows researchers to upload morphological data and affiliate it with phylogenetic matrices. In both cases, MorphoBank is project-based, meaning a team of researchers can create a project and share the images and associated data exclusively with each other. When a paper associated with the project is published, the research team can make their data permanently available for view on MorphoBank where it is now archived.   The phylogenetic matrix aspect of MorphoBank is designed to aid systematists working alone or in teams to build large phylogenetic trees using morphology (anatomy, histology, neurology, or any aspect of phenotypes) or a combination of morphology and molecular data.

FAIRsharing.2fbnkr	Minimum Information About Particle Tracking Experiments	MIAPTE	The proposed Minimum Information About Particle Tracking Experiments (MIAPTE) reporting guidelines described here aims to deliver a set of rules representing the minimal information required to report and support interpretation and assessment of data arising from intracellular multiple particle tracking (MPT) experiments. Examples of such experiments are those tracking viral particles as they move from the site of entry to the site of replication within an infected cell, or those following vesicular dynamics during secretion, endocytosis, or exocytosis. By promoting development of community standards, MIAPTE will contribute to making MPT data FAIR (Findable Accessible Interoperable and Reusable). Ultimately, the goal of MIAPTE is to promote and maximize data access, discovery, preservation, re-use, and re-purposing through efficient annotation, and ultimately to enable reproducibility of particle tracking experiments.                                                                                                         The MIAPTE guidelines are intended for different categories of users: 1) Scientists with the desire to make new results available in a way that can be interpreted unequivocally by both humans and machines. For this class of users, MIAPTE provides data descriptors to define data entry terms and the analysis workflow in a unified manner. 2) Scientists wishing to evaluate, replicate and re-analyze results published by others. For this class of users MIAPTE provides descriptors that define the analysis procedures in a manner that facilitates its reproduction. 3) Developers who want to take advantage of the schema of MIAPTE to produce MIAPTE compatible tools. MIAPTE consists of a list of controlled vocabulary (CV) terms that describe elements and properties for the minimal description of particle tracking experiments, with a focus on viral and vesicular traffic within cells. As part of this submission we provide entity relationship (ER) diagrams that show the relationship between terms. Finally, we also provide documents containing the MIAPTE-compliant XML schema describing the data model used by Open Microscopy Environment inteGrated Analysis (OMEGA), our novel particle tracking data analysis and management tool, which is reported in a separate manuscript.                                                                  MIAPTE is structured in two sub-sections: 1) Section 1 contains elements, attributes and data structures describing the results of particle tracking, namely: particles, links, segments and trajectories. 2) Section 2 contains details about the algorithmic procedure utilized to produce and analyze trajectories as well as the results of trajectory analysis. In addition MIAPTE includes those OME-XML elements that are required to capture the acquisition parameters and the structure of images to be subjected to particle tracking The current version of the model, MIAPTE v02, is intended to be a Request for Comments (Crocker and Postel, 2008). Members of the scientific and developer communities are invited to collaborate with us to modify, extend, and improve the model.

FAIRsharing.2LyTxE	Polygenic Risk Score Reporting Standards	PRS-RS	The Polygenic Risk Score Reporting Standards (PRS-RS) provides the minimal information expected of authors to promote the internal validity, transparency, and reproducibility of PRS by requiring authors to detail the study population, statistical methods, and clinical utility of a published score. PRSs, which often aggregate results from genome-wide association studies, can bridge the gap between initial discovery efforts and clinical applications for the estimation of disease risk using genetics. However, there is notable heterogeneity in the application and reporting of these risk scores, which hinders the translation of PRSs into clinical care. These guidelines update the Genetic Risk Prediction Studies (GRIPS) Statement to reflect the present state of the field. Drawing on the input of experts in epidemiology, statistics, disease-specific applications, implementation and policy, this reporting framework defines the minimal information that is needed to interpret and evaluate PRSs, especially with respect to downstream clinical applications. Items span detailed descriptions of study populations, statistical methods for the development and validation of PRSs and considerations for the potential limitations of these scores. In addition, data deposition is encouraged via the PGS Catalog to facilitate reproducibility and comparative benchmarking. By providing these criteria in a structured format that builds on existing standards and ontologies, the aim is to facilitate translation into clinical care and progress towards defining best practice.

FAIRsharing.3dm6gm	Edinburgh Human Developmental Anatomy	EHDA	A structured controlled vocabulary of stage-specific anatomical structures of the human. It has been designed to mesh with the mouse anatomy (EMAP ontology) and incorporates each Carnegie stage of development (CS1-20). The timed version of the human developmental anatomy ontology gives all the tissues present at each Carnegie Stage (CS) of human development (1-20) linked by a part-of rule. Each term is mentioned only once so that the embryo at each stage can be seen as the simple sum of its parts. Users should note that tissues that are symmetric (e.g. eyes, ears, limbs) are only mentioned once. The EHDA; Hunter et al. 2003 is less complete than later versions: it comprises a set of ontologies, one for each Carnegie stage (CS) (1–20) that only includes basic part_of data. Its structure was derived from the original EMAP ontology, and its content was based partly on this and partly on a limited study of sectioned human material.

FAIRsharing.780299	Proteome-pI 2.0 -  Proteome Isoelectric Point Database	Proteome-pI 2.0	Proteome-pI 2.0 is an updated version of an online database (Proteome-pI [http://isoelectricpointdb.org/]) containing the information about predicted isoelectric points. The isoelectric point, the pH at which a particular molecule carries no net electrical charge, is an important parameter for many analytical biochemistry and proteomics techniques, especially for 2D gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), capillary isoelectric focusing, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and X-ray protein crystallography.

The following changes have been introduced:
- the number of proteomes included has been increased four-fold (from 5,029 to 20,115);
- new algorithms for isoelectric point prediction have been added (21 algorithms in total);
- the prediction of pKa dissociation constants for over 61 million proteins have been included (5.38 Billion predictions in total);
- the prediction of isoelectric point for in silico digests of proteomes with the five most commonly used proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, trypsin+LysC, LysN, ArgC) have been added (9.58 Billion peptides).

The database allows the retrieval of virtual 2D-PAGE plots and the development of customized fractions of proteome based on isoelectric point and molecular weight. Moreover, Proteome-pI 2.0 facilitates statistical comparisons of the various prediction methods as well as biological investigation of protein isoelectric point space in all kingdoms of life (updated statistics available at http://isoelectricpointdb2.org/statistics.html). The database includes various statistics and tools for interactive browsing, searching, and sorting. It can be searched and browsed by organism name, average isoelectric point, molecular weight, or amino acid frequencies. Proteins with extreme pI values are also available. For individual proteomes, users can retrieve proteins of interest given the method, isoelectric point, and molecular weight ranges (this particular feature can be highly useful to limit potential targets in the analysis of 2DPAGE gels or before conducting mass spectrometry). Finally, some general statistics (total number of proteins, amino acids, average sequence length, amino acid, and di-amino acid frequencies) and datasets corresponding to major protein databases such as UniProtKB/TrEMBL and the NCBI non-redundant (nr) database have also been precalculated.

FAIRsharing.8ntfwm	Standards for Reporting Enzymology Data Guidelines	STRENDA	STRENDA stands for “Standards for Reporting Enzymology Data”. For researchers it is essential to be able to compare, evaluate, interpret and reproduce experimental research results published in the literature and databases. Thus, for enzyme research, the STRENDA Commission has established standards for data reporting with the aim to improve the quality of data published in the scientific literature.  The STRENDA Guidelines were developed through extensive interactions with the biochemistry community to define the minimum information that is needed to correctly describe assay conditions (List Level 1A) and enzyme activity data (List Level 1B). However, STRENDA aims neither to dictate or limit the experimental techniques used in enzymology experiments nor to establish a metric for judging the quality of experimental data, but to ensure that data sets are complete and validated, allowing scientists to review, reuse and verify them. The emphasis is on providing useful and reliable information. With the aim to support authors to comprehensively report kinetic and equilibrium data from their investigations of enzyme activities, currently more than 55 international biochemistry journals already included the STRENDA Guidelines in their Instructions for Authors. The STRENDA Commission is continuously consulting the wider science community, reports the progress of its work and discusses new approaches regularly at the Beilstein Enzymology Symposia and in scientific journals.

FAIRsharing.A2W4nz	FAIR Metrics - Metadata Longevity	FM-A2	FM-A2 measures the existence of metadata even in the absence/removal of data. Cross-references to data from a third-party’s FAIR data and metadata will naturally degrade over time, and become “stale links”. In such cases, it is important for FAIR providers to continue to provide descriptors of what the data was to assist in the continued interpretation of those third-party data. As per FAIR Principle F3, this metadata remains discoverable, even in the absence of the data, because it contains an explicit reference to the IRI of the data. This metric requires a URL to a formal metadata longevity plan. This metric applies to part A2 of the FAIR Principles.

FAIRsharing.a4wgws	Real-time PCR Data Markup Language	RDML	The RDML file format is developed by the RDML consortium (http://www.rdml.org) and can be used free of charge. The RDML file format was created to encourage the exchange, publication, revision and re-analysis of raw qPCR data. The core of an RDML file is an experiment, not a PCR run. Therefore all the information is collected which is required to understand an experiment. The structure of the file format was inspired by a database structure. In the file are several master elements, which are then referred to in other parts of the file. This structure allows to reduce the amount of redundant information and encourages the user to provide useful information. The Real-time PCR Data Markup Language (RDML) is a structured and universal data standard for exchanging quantitative PCR (qPCR) data. The data standard should contain sufficient information to understand the experimental setup, re-analyse the data and interpret the results. The data standard is a compressed text file in Extensible Markup Language (XML) and enables transparent exchange of annotated qPCR data between instrument software and third-party data analysis packages, between colleagues and collaborators, and between authors, peer reviewers, journals and readers. To support the public acceptance of this standard, both an on-line RDML file generator is available for end users, as well as RDML software libraries to be used by software developers, enabling import and export of RDML data files.

FAIRsharing.ae5rv	Semantic reference model for making rare disease resources linkable	None	A subset of ontology classes and properties for connecting rare disease data in the context of creating FAIR rare disease data 'at the source'. The aim is to facilitate data annotation at the source in order to enable questions and analysis across rare disease resources (e.g. biobanks, registries, molecular data). I.e. the model is not meant as a new conceptualization. Ontology files: 1. rdc-core: the minimal set of classes and properties to map to the data in the sources of the platform. RD core represents little more that the lowest level types for the identifiers of the sources of the Rare Disease Connect platform. 2. rdc-meta: the minimal semantic model, defined as much as possible using existing ontologies (OBIB, etc.). 3. rdc-meta-extended: this model includes the subclasses and properties of the entities that were imported from source ontologies, i.e. when you use the ‘move’ function of protege, rather than just copy the URI. 4. rdc-thesaurus: mappings to ‘concepts’. A SKOS-based thesaurus represents a ‘light-weight’ ontology. This allows us to define in simple terms the relations between similar or equal terms in different terminologies. 5. rdc-mapping: mapping between models, for instance between the SKOS concepts and RD-core and RD-meta. 6. rdc-example-instances: example instances (‘individuals’) to show the model at instance level. The instances, especially the IDs relate to actual data in data sources. Their datatype properties link to data.
FAIRsharing.ae8hpt	Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering	DOLCE	DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering) is a foundational ontology developed as part of the WonderWeb Foundational Ontologies Library (WFOL).  The development of this library has been guided by the need of a reliable set of foundational ontologies that can serve as 1) astarting point for building other ontologies, 2) a reference point for easy and rigorous comparisons among different ontological approaches, and 3) a rigorous basis for analyzing, harmonizing and integrating existing ontologies and metadata standards (by manually mapping them into some general module(s) in the library). DOLCE is the first module of WFOL and it is not a candidate for a universal standard ontology. Rather, it is intended as a starting point for comparing and elucidating the relationships with the other modules of the library, and also for clarifying the hidden assumptions underlying existing ontologies or linguistic resources such as WordNet.  As reflected by its acronym, DOLCE has a clear cognitive bias, in the sense that it aims at capturing the ontological categories underlying natural language and human commonsense. DOLCE is an ontology that focuses on particulars in the sense that its domain of discourse is restricted to them. The project is complete, though the ontology remains available for use.

FAIRsharing.ak8p5g	MicroArray Gene Expression Tabular Format	MAGE-TAB	Sharing of microarray data within the research community has been greatly facilitated by the development of the disclosure and communication standards MIAME and MAGE-ML by the FGED Society. However, the complexity of the MAGE-ML format has made its use impractical for laboratories lacking dedicated bioinformatics support. We propose a simple tab-delimited, spreadsheet-based format, MAGE-TAB, which will become a part of the MAGE microarray data standard and can be used for annotating and communicating microarray data in a MIAME compliant fashion. MAGE-TAB will enable laboratories without bioinformatics experience or support to manage, exchange and submit well-annotated microarray data in a standard format using a spreadsheet.

FAIRsharing.B2sbNh	FAIR Metrics - Use Qualified References	FM-I3	FM-I3 is a metric concerned with relationships within (meta)data, and between local and third-party data, and whether or not they have explicit and ‘useful’ semantic meaning. One of the reasons that HTML is not suitable for machine-readable knowledge representation is that the hyperlinks between one document and another do not explain the nature of the relationship - it is “unqualified”. For Interoperability, the relationships within and between data must be more semantically rich than “is (somehow) related to”. Numerous ontologies include richer relationships that can be used for this purpose, at various levels of domain-specificity. For example, the use of skos for terminologies (e.g. exact matches), or the use of SIO for genomics (e.g. “has phenotype” for the relationship between a variant and its phenotypic consequences). The expectation is that some of the references/relations point outwards to other resources, owned by third-parties; this is one of the requirements for 5-star linked data. Therefore linksets (in the formal sense) representing part or all of a resource must be provided. This metric applies to part I3 of the FAIR Principles.

FAIRsharing.bfqdc8	Generic Feature Format Version 2	GFF2	GFF2 is a supported format in GMOD, but it is now deprecated and if you have a choice you should use GFF3. Unfortunately, data is sometimes only available in GFF2 format. GFF2 has a number of shortcomings compared to GFF3. GFF2 can only represent 2 level feature hierarchies, while GFF3 can support arbitrary levels. GFF2 also does not require that column 3, the feature type, be part of the sequence ontology. It can be any string. This often led to quality control and data exchange problems. The GFF format is a flat tab-delimited file, each line of which corresponds to an annotation, or feature. Each line has nine columns.

FAIRsharing.c12tyk	mzTab	mzTab	The aim of the format is to present the results of a proteomics experiment in a computationally accessible overview. The aim is not to provide the detailed evidence for these results, or allow recreating the process which led to the results. Both of these functions are established through links to more detailed representations in other formats, in particular mzIdentML and mzQuantML. mzTab is meant to be a light-weight, tab-delimited file format for proteomics data. The target audience for this format are primarily researchers outside of proteomics. It should be easy to parse and only contain the minimal information required to evaluate the results of a proteomics experiment. One of the goals of this file format is that it, for example, should be possible for a biologist to open such a file in Excel and still be able to "see" the data. This format should also become a way to disseminate proteomics results through protocols such as DAS.

FAIRsharing.cbfbbb	GeneNet Engine	GeneNet Engine	GeneNet Engine is an exploratory tool to aid hypothesis and biomarker development at a systems-level for genotype-phenotype relationships. Expressed phenotypes may arise due to interactions between multiple genes in a system and effects from the surrounding environment. Therefore, a high systems-level view is needed to identify gene sets causal for a trait. The ability to predict genes that effect important traits is of great importance to agriculture and health. System biology approaches, that combine genomics, gene co-expression networks and data from genetic studies help provide a view at the systems-level of gene interactions. As co-expressed genes tend to be involved in similar processes, it is expected that co-expressed genes may work together to give rise to specific pheontypes.  The network module serves as the basic unit of exploration in this site.

FAIRsharing.cuyPH9	FAIR Metrics -  Meets Community Standards	FM-R1.3	FM-R1.3 is a metric concerned with certification, from a recognized body, of the resource meeting community standards. Various communities have recognized that maximizing the usability of their data requires them to adopt a set of guidelines for metadata (often in the form of “minimal information about…” models). Non-compliance with these standards will often render a dataset ‘reuseless’ because critical information about its context or provenance is missing. However, adherence to community standards does more than just improve reusability of the data. The software used by the community for analysis and visualization often depends on the (meta)data having certain fields; thus, non-compliance with standards may result in the data being unreadable by its associated tools. As such, data should be (individually) certified as being compliant, likely through some automated process (e.g. submitting the data to the community’s online validation service). A certification saying that the resource is compliant must be provided to fulfil this metric. This metric applies to part R1.3 of the FAIR Principles.

FAIRsharing.daXv6l	Astronomical Data Query Language	ADQL	The Astronomical Data Query Language (ADQL) is the language used by the IVOA to represent astronomy queries posted to VO services. The IVOA has developed several standardized protocols to access astronomical data, e.g., Simple Image Access (SIA) protocol and Simple Spectral Access (SSA) protocol for image and spectral data respectively. These protocols might be satisfied using a single table query. However, different VO services have different needs in terms of query complexity and ADQL arises in this context. The ADQL specification makes no distinction between core and advanced or extended functionalities. Hence ADQL has been built according to a single Backus Naur Form (BNF) based language definition. Any service making use of ADQL would then define the level of compliancy to the language. This would allow the notion of core and extension to be service-driven and it would decouple the language from the service specifications. ADQL is based on the Structured Query Language (SQL), especially on SQL 92 1 2 3. . The VO has a number of tabular data sets and many of them are stored in relational databases, making SQL a convenient access means. A subset of the SQL grammar has been extended to support queries that are specific to astronomy. Similarly to SQL, the ADQL language definition is not semantically safe by design and therefore this specification defines syntactical correctness only. Type safety has been achieved as far as it can be done in SQL.

FAIRsharing.dmhjcg	Quality Control Markup Language	QCML	An XML format for quality-related data of mass spectrometry and other high-throughput experiments. Quality control is increasingly recognized as a crucial aspect of mass spectrometry based proteomics. Several recent papers discuss relevant parameters for quality control and present applications to extract these from the instrumental raw data. What has been missing, however, is a standard data exchange format for reporting these performance metrics. We therefore developed the qcML format, an XML-based standard that follows the design principles of the related mzML, mzIdentML, mzQuantML, and TraML standards from the HUPO-PSI (Proteomics Standards Initiative). In addition to the XML format, we also provide tools for the calculation of a wide range of quality metrics as well as a database format and interconversion tools, so that existing LIMS systems can easily add relational storage of the quality control data to their existing schema. We here describe the qcML specification, along with possible use cases and an illustrative example of the subsequent analysis possibilities.

Traditionally, it is the Chief Scientist's obligation to submit a CSR to his/her National Oceanographic Data Centre (NODC) not later than two weeks after the cruise. This provides a first level inventory of measurements and samples collected at sea. Information such as the ship track, objectives of the cruise and principal investigators contacts are also included among other metadata elements tested to be useful in by the marine community practice. The Reports have been compiled over time and encoded using . Though in the past a XML schema derived from ISO 19115 DTD was used, the current implementation utilizes the ISO 19139 Schema.
FAIRsharing.E3Nr1d	FAIR Maturity Indicator Gen2-MI-I2A	None	The FAIR Maturity Indicator Gen2-MI-I2A measures if the (meta)data uses vocabularies that are, themselves, FAIR. For interoperability, it must be possible to identify data that can be integrated like-with-like. This requires that the data, and the provenance descriptors of the data, should (where reasonable) use vocabularies and terminologies that are, themselves, FAIR. In this loose MI, we test only if the vocabulary terms resolve (e.g. to a human-readable page). We do not test if they resolve to machine-readable information. A second Maturity Indicator (Gen2-FM-I2B) is for that stricter test.

FAIRsharing.eMKdXo	IVOA Sky Event Reporting Metadata	VOEvent	VOEvent defines the content and meaning of a standard information packet for representing, transmitting, publishing and archiving information about a transient celestial event, with the implication that timely follow-up is of interest. The objective is to motivate the observation of targets-of-opportunity, to drive robotic telescopes, to trigger archive searches, and to alert the community. VOEvent is focused on the reporting of photon events, but events mediated by disparate phenomena such as neutrinos, gravitational waves, and solar or atmospheric particle bursts may also be reported. Structured data is used, rather than natural language, so that automated systems can effectively interpret VOEvent packets. Each packet may contain zero or more of the "who, what, where, when & how" of a detected event, but in addition, may contain a hypothesis (a "why") regarding the nature of the underlying physical cause of the event. Citations to previous VOEvents may be used to place each event in its correct context. Proper curation is encouraged throughout each event's life cycle from discovery through successive follow-ups. VOEvent packets gain persistent identifiers and are typically stored in databases reached via registries. VOEvent packets may therefore reference other packets in various ways. Packets are encouraged to be small and to be processed quickly. This standard does not define a transport layer or the design of clients, repositories, publishers or brokers; it does not cover policy issues such as who can publish, who can build a registry of events, who can subscribe to a particular registry, nor the intellectual property issues.

FAIRsharing.EwnE1n	FAIR Metrics - Access authorization	FM-A1.2	FM-A1.2 measures whether or not the specification describes a protocol to access restricted content. Not all content can be made available without restriction. For instance, access and distribution of personal health data may be restricted by law or by organizational policy. In such cases, it is important that the protocol by which such content can be accessed is fully specified. Ideally, electronic content can be obtained first by applying for access. Once the requester is formally authorized to access the content, they may receive it in some electronic means, for instance by obtaining an download URL, or through a more sophisticated transaction mechanism (e.g. authenticate, authorize), or by any other means. The goal should be to reduce the time it takes for valid requests to be fulfilled. Therefore the following information must be provided: i) true/false concerning whether authorization is needed, ii) a URL that resolves to a description of the process to obtain access to restricted content. This metric applies to part A1.2 of the FAIR Principles.

FAIRsharing.f2axyv	SCAR report No 30 June 2011 - SCAR Data Policy	None	SCAR (see www.scar.org) is charged with initiating, developing and coordinating high quality international scientific research in the Antarctic region, and advising on the role of the Antarctic region in the Earth system. The scientific business of SCAR is conducted by its Standing Scientific Groups in the Physical-, Life- and Geo- Sciences which represent the scientific disciplines active in Antarctic research. These groups share information on disciplinary scientific research being conducted by national Antarctic programmes; identify research areas or fields where current research is lacking; coordinate proposals for future research by national Antarctic programmes to achieve maximum scientific and logistical effectiveness; identify research areas or fields that might be best investigated by a major SCAR Scientific Research Programme; and establish Action and Expert Groups to address specific research topics within the discipline. SCAR related research data is highly multidisciplinary and disparate. This policy aims to provide a framework for these data to be handled in a consistent manner, and to strike a balance between the rights of investigators and the need for widespread access through the free and unrestricted sharing and exchange of both data and metadata. This policy is compatible with the data principles of SCAR’s parent body, ICSU and other relevant international agencies (e.g. WMO), and with the goals of Article III 1 c of the Antarctic Treaty. Since SCAR coordinates a distributed programme of research, generally implemented through a number of nationally self-managed projects, the principles enshrined in this Data Policy should be applied to data in each SCAR-endorsed Project. In order to be considered part of a SCAR Research Programme, each Project should follow the SCAR Data Policy, submit metadata and linked datasets to the Antarctic Master Directory (AMD - gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Data/portals/amd/) in a reasonable timeframe, and should have an appropriately funded data management plan in place before the Project begins. Nations affiliated with SCAR are urged to establish a National Antarctic Data Centre (NADC) or assign NADC responsibilities to an existing national institution capable of carrying out NADC obligations. NADCs in collaboration with SCAR Research Projects and Programmes will work towards developing a SCAR Antarctic Data and Information System (ADMS). The SCAR Standing Committee on Antarctic Data Management (SCADM) is responsible for this Data Policy. Questions about the policy and its implementation should be directed to the SCADM Executive (see http://scadm.scar.org).

FAIRsharing.fr3ng0	Edinburgh Human Developmental Anatomy Abstract	EHDAA	A structured controlled vocabulary of stage-specific anatomical structures of the human. It has been designed to mesh with the mouse anatomy (EMAP ontology) and incorporates each Carnegie stage of development (CS1-20). This abstract version of the human developmental anatomy ontology compresses all the tissues present over Carnegie stages 1-20 into a single hierarchy. The heart, for example, is present from Carnegie Stage 9 onwards and is thus represented by 12 EHDA IDs (one for each stage). In the abstract mouse, it has a single ID so that the abstract term given as just heart really means heart (CS 9-20). This ontology was made computationally and later deemed "incoherent" by the authors because the stage-dependent hierarchical structures were not integrated.

VOTable is designed as a flexible storage and exchange format for tabular data, with particular emphasis on astronomical tables. The VOTable format is an XML standard for the interchange of data represented as a set of tables. In this context, a table is an unordered set of rows, each of a uniform structure, as specified in the table description (the table metadata). Each row in a table is a sequence of table cells, and each of these contains either a primitive data type, or an array of such primitives. VOTable is derived from the Astrores format, itself modeled on the FITS Table format; VOTable was designed to be close to the FITS Binary Table format.

FAIRsharing.gB7jed	Core Scientific Dataset Model	CSDM	The Core Scientific Dataset (CSD) model with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) serialization is a lightweight, portable, and versatile standard for intra- and interdisciplinary scientific data exchange. This model supports datasets with a p-component dependent variable, {U0, …, Uq, …, Up−1}, discretely sampled at M unique points in a d-dimensional independent variable (X0, …, Xk, …, Xd−1) space. Moreover, this sampling is over an orthogonal grid, regular or rectilinear, where the principal coordinate axes of the grid are the independent variables. It can also hold correlated datasets assuming the different physical quantities (dependent variables) are sampled on the same orthogonal grid of independent variables. The model encapsulates the dependent variables’ sampled data values and the minimum metadata needed to accurately represent this data in an appropriate coordinate system of independent variables. The CSD model can serve as a re-usable building block in the development of more sophisticated portable scientific dataset file standards.

SimDAL is divided in three parts. First, SimDAL Repositories store the descriptions of theoretical projects and numerical codes. They can be used by clients to discover theoretical services associated with projects of interest. Second, SimDAL Search services are dedicated to the discovery of precise datasets. Finally, SimDAL Data Access services are dedicated to retrieve the original simulation output data, as plain raw data or formatted datasets cut-outs. To manage any kind of data, eventually large or at high-dimensionality, the SimDAL standard lets publishers choose any underlying implementation technology.

FAIRsharing.j2np9m	Menelas Project Top-Level Ontology	TOP-MENELAS	The two main goals MENELAS contributes to are to (i) Provide better account of and better access to medical information through natural languages in order to help physicians in their daily practice, and to (ii) Enhance European cooperation by multilingual access to standardised medical nomenclatures. The major achievements of MENELAS are the realisation of its two functional systems: (i) The Document Indexing System encodes free text PDSs into both an internal representation (a set of Conceptual Graphs) and international nomenclature codes (ICD-9-CM). Instances of the Document Indexing System have been realised for French, English and Dutch ; (ii) The Consultation System allows users to access the information contained in PDSs previously indexed by the Document Indexing System. The test domain for the project was coronary diseases. The existing prototype shows promising results for information retrieval from natural language PDSs and for automatically encoding PDSs into an existing classification such as ICD-9-CM. A set of components, tools, knowledge bases and methods has also been produced by the project. These include language-independent ontology and models for the domain of coronary diseases; conceptual description of the relevant ICD-9-CM codes. This ontology includes a top-ontology, a top-domain ontology and a domain ontology (Coronay diseases surgery). The menelas-top ontology here is the part of the whole ontology without any reference to medical domain.

FAIRsharing.jq69k3	World geographical scheme for recording plant distributions	None	In setting out to establish standards for data fields in botanical databases, the International Working Group on Taxonomic Databases for Plant Sciences (TDWG) identified at an early stage of its existence a need for an agreed system of geographical units at approximately "country" level and upwards for use in recording plant distributions. This would aim to provide a standard which different organisations maintaining databases could adopt so that they could compare and exchange data with each other without loss of information due to incompatible geographical boundaries. The present publication has resulted from the deliberations over a period of three years of a committee of both taxonomic and applied botanists set up to produce such a standard. The system offered covers the whole world and identifies units at four levels, firstly continental, secondly regional (or subcontinental), thirdly at what may be called "Botanical Country" level (which may often ignore purely political considerations), and fourthly at a slightly lower level called "Basic Recording Units" where political integrity is fully recognised. In many cases, where Botanical Countries have no complicating political factors, the units at Level-3 and Level-4 are identical. Very large countries, however, have been subdivided into more conveniently sized units according to constituent states or provinces. It is a fundamental principle that units at all levels are bounded either by political boundaries which appear on modern maps or by coast lines. Modern geographical information systems have not superseded the need for such a scheme. While this standard is still in use, it is no longer actively maintained (labelled as prior on the TDWG website).

FAIRsharing.Lcws1N	FAIR Metrics - Indexed in a searchable resource	FM-F4	FM-F4 provides a measurement of the degree to which the digital resource can be found using web-based search engines. Most people use a search engine to initiate a search for a particular digital resource of interest. If the resource or its metadata are not indexed by web search engines, then this would substantially diminish an individual’s ability to find and reuse it. Thus, the ability to discover the resource should be tested using i) its identifier, ii) other text-based metadata. The persistent identifier of the resource and one or more URLs that give search results of different search engines must be provided. This metric applies to part F4 of the FAIR Principles.

FAIRsharing.lEZbPK	FAIR Maturity Indicator Gen2-MI-A2	None	The FAIR Maturity Indicator Gen2-MI-A2 measures if there is a policy for metadata persistence. Cross-references to data from third-party’s FAIR data and metadata will naturally degrade over time, and become “stale links”. In such cases, it is important for FAIR providers to continue to provide descriptors of what the data was to assist in the continued interpretation of those third-party data. As per FAIR Principle F3, this metadata remains discoverable, even in the absence of the data, because it contains an explicit reference to the IRI of the data.
FAIRsharing.lFdTxB	Disbiome	Disbiome	Disbiome is a database covering microbial composition changes in different kinds of diseases. Disease names, detection methods or organism names can be used as search queries giving that return information related to the experiment (related disease/bacteria, abundancy subject/control, control type, detection method and related literature).

FAIRsharing.lWbenx	Reference list of Metabolite names	RefMet	RefMet provides a standardized reference nomenclature for both discrete metabolite structures and metabolite species identified by spectroscopic techniques in metabolomics experiments. This is an essential prerequisite for the ability to compare and contrast metabolite data across different experiments and studies. Over 200,000 names from a set of over 1,100 MS and NMR studies on the Metabolomics Workbench has been used to generate a highly curated analytical chemistry-centric list of common names for metabolite structures and isobaric species. Additionally, the vast majority of these names have been linked to a metabolite classification system using a combination of LIPID MAPS and ClassyFire classification methods. A name-conversion user interface is provided where users can submit a list of metabolite names and map them to the corresponding RefMet names. New metabolites are constantly being added to RefMet, however very new metabolite names generated by metabolomics experiments may not currently map to RefMet identifiers. Nevertheless, RefMet has the ability to greatly increase the data-sharing potential of metabolomics experiments and facilitate "meta-analysis" and systems biology objectives for the majority of commonly encountered metabolite species.

FAIRsharing.md3e78	Audubon Core Multimedia Resources Metadata Schema	AC	The Audubon Core metadata schema ("AC") is a representation-neutral metadata vocabulary for describing biodiversity-related multimedia resources and collections. Multimedia Resources are digital or physical artifacts which normally comprise more than text. These include pictures, artwork, drawings, photographs, sound, video, animations, presentation materials, interactive online media including identification tool packages involving text and other media. A multimedia collection is an assemblage of such objects whether curated or not and whether electronically accessible or not. For the purposes of this schema we regard a collection of multimedia resources itself as a 'multimedia resource'. Multimedia descriptions are digital records that document underlying multimedia resources. Audubon Core is focused on biodiversity-related multimedia resources. It shares terminology and concerns with many well known and important standards for describing access to resources such as Dublin Core(DC), Darwin Core (DwC), the Adobe Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP), the International Press and Telecommunications Council (IPTC) the Metadata Working Group (MWG) schema, the Natural Collections Schema (NCD), and others. Where there is an exact match to concerns of such standards, Audubon Core adopts their identifiers and definitions. Audubon Core particularly intends to ease the burden of holders of descriptions specified either by DwC or DC by allowing use of those existing descriptions where appropriate.

FAIRsharing.mp8js2	Medical Web Lifestyle Aggregator	MWLA	This ontology designed and developed in order to represent the detected intentions from the Web Lifestyle Data Aggregator. In particular, it seeks to represent what is involved in the gathering of data from the web and social lifestyle of user on the Internet. We decided, therefore, to develop the ontology using the Protégé v5.0, a free, open-source ontology editor from the Stanford University. The outcome of Protégé is available on the following URL: http://carre.kmi.open.ac.uk/ontology/lifestyle.owl The presented ontology is generic and can support different type of providers (e.g. web searches, Facebook, Twitter etc.). Additionally, the predefined intentions are also generic supporting the majority of intentions in the Web. In the context of CARRE, we utilize, as a first attempt, the web searches as provider and we only upload the relevant intentions (health and travel) to CARRE in the private RDF repository. A user (representing an individual person whose data is being represented using the terms of this ontology) has connections. A connection represents that a Web Lifestyle Data Aggregator of a particular personal computer of user provides intentions for particulars providers. A connection is therefore associated with a UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) that represents an installation of the aggregator. A provider can be the web searches, Facebook or Twitter. A measurement is associated with a provider and a connection in order to declare the connection (i.e. the Web Lifestyle Data Aggregator of a particular personal computer) from which a measurement came. Every measurement must have a date at which the detected intention was taken, a weight which defines the importance of an intention and of course the detected intention that is only relevant to CARRE.

Please note that there are two similar latin terms: "exsiccata, ae" is feminine and used for a set of dried specimens as defined above, whereas the term "exsiccatum, i" is neutral and used for dried specimens in general. If available, images of one or more examplary labels are added to give layout information. IndExs is powered by the Diversity Workbench database framework.
FAIRsharing.namxfm	Functional Genomics Experiment Markup Language	FuGE-ML	Functional genomics experiments present many challenges in data archiving, sharing and querying. As the size and complexity of data generated from such experiments grows, so does the requirement for standard data formats. To address these needs, the Functional Genomics Experiment [Object Model / Markup-Language] (FuGE-OM, FuGE-ML) has been created to facilitate the development of data standards.FuGE is a model of the shared components in different functional genomics domains. FuGE facilitates the development of data standards in functional genomics in two ways: 1. FuGE provides a model of common components in functional genomics investigations, such as materials, data, protocols, equipment and software. These models can be extended to develop modular data formats with consistent structure. 2. FuGE provides a framework for capturing complete laboratory workflows, enabling the integration of pre-existing data formats. In this context, FuGE allows the capture of additional metadata that gives formats a context within the complete workflow. FuGE is available as a UML model and an XML Schema

FAIRsharing.nft558	Plant Diversity Ontology	PDO_CAS	Plant Diversity Ontology (PDO) is the outcome of the construction tasks of domain ontology of science in the project of Scientific & Technological Knowledge Organization Systems (STKOS). The structure of PDO centers on species, including micro level of molecular, cell and tissue, medium level of plant organs, species and population, and macro level of ecosystem. The classes of PDO also capture the habitat, environmental conditions and expand the general characteristics of plants, completing the instances richness for plant species, geographical, classification and morphology. Furthermore, PDO builds the relationships among species, region, morphology, plant organs, developmental stage, revealing the list of species in an area, the morphology and life form of plants, and development process of species. In sum, PDO shows a growth process or development stage of a species and its structure characteristics in particular space and time scale, realizing the description of species diversity, ecosystem diversity and genetic diversity. At present, PDO has been applied to the platform of Go to Selected Open Access Journals (GoOA) developed by National Science Library of Chinese Academy of Sciences, supporting concept retrieval and concept extension for GoOA.
FAIRsharing.nggj0j	Joint Photographic Experts Group Format	JPEG Format	Joint Photographic Experts Group Format is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images, particularly for those images produced by digital photography. JPEG JFIF, which is what people generally mean when they refer to "JPEG", is a file format created by the Independent JPEG Group (IJG) for the transport of single JPEG-compressed images. The JPEG compression format was standardised by ISO in August 1990 and commercial applications using it began to show up in 1991. The widely used IJG implementation was first publicly released in October 1991 and has been considerably developed since that time. JPEG JFIF images are widely used on the Web. The amount of compression can be adjusted to achieve the desired trade-off between file size and visual quality. Progressive JPEG is a means of reordering the information so that, after only a small part has been downloaded, a hazy view of the entire image is presented rather than a crisp view of just a small part. It is part of the original JPEG specification, but was not implemented in Web browsers until rather later on, around 1996. It is now fairly widely supported. Although the "baseline" variety of JPEG is believed patent-free, there are many patents associated with some optional features of JPEG, namely arithmetic coding and hierarchical storage. For this reason, these optional features are never used on the Web.
FAIRsharing.ngme77	Human disease methylation database	DiseaseMeth	The human disease methylation database, DiseaseMeth is a web based resource focused on the aberrant methylomes of human diseases.

FAIRsharing.nh1DmP	Health Data Research Innovation Gateway	Innovation Gateway	The Health Data Research Innovation Gateway (the ‘Gateway’) provides a common entry point to discover and enquire about access to UK health datasets for research and innovation. It provides detailed information about the datasets, which are held by members of the UK Health Data Research Alliance, such as a description, size of the population, and the legal basis for access. The Gateway includes the ability to search for research projects, publications and health data tools, such as those related to COVID-19. New interactive features provide a community forum for researchers to collaborate and connect and the ability to add research projects. The Innovation Gateway does not hold or store any datasets or patient or health data but rather acts as a portal to allow discovery of datasets and to request access to them for health research. A dataset is a collection of related individual pieces of data but in the case of health data, identifiable information (e.g. name or NHS number) is removed and data is de-identified where possible. When you access the Gateway you will not be able to view or extract the data itself. Instead, you will be able to see information that describes what the different datasets are (e.g. where the dataset has come from, a description of the dataset, the time period and the geographical areas the dataset covers). In order to access the data, you will need to sign in and then follow the access request process. Only once your request has been through the process to ensure your application meets all of the requirements and is approved by the data controller will you be able to access the data. Your access to the data will be provided outside of the Gateway in line with the processes of the data controller - read through our FAQs for more information on the process. The datasets that are discoverable through the Innovation Gateway are from organisations in the NHS, research institutes and charities, which are part of the UK Health Data Research Alliance. You can find out more about its members on the UK Health Data Research Alliance website. The information provided about the datasets has been provided by the relevant data controller and is continually updated.
FAIRsharing.NHCOKK	FAIR Maturity Indicator Gen2-MI-F1A	None	The FAIR Maturity Indicator Gen2-MI-F1A measures whether the GUID matches (regexp) a GUID scheme recognized as being globally unique in the FAIRSharing registry. The uniqueness of an identifier is a necessary condition to unambiguously refer that resource, and that resource alone. Otherwise, an identifier shared by multiple resources will confound efforts to describe that resource, or to use the identifier to retrieve it.
FAIRsharing.Nhfwat	The conserved clinical variation visualization tool	ConVarT	The availability of genetic variants, together with phenotypic annotations from model organisms, facilitates comparing these variants with equivalent variants in humans. However, existing databases and search tools do not make it easy to scan for equivalent variants, namely “orthologous variants,” between humans and other organisms. Therefore, we developed an integrated search engine called ConVarT (http://www.convart.org/) for orthologous variants between humans, mice, and C. elegans. ConVarT incorporates annotations (including phenotypic and pathogenic) into variants, and these previously unexploited phenotypic OrthoVars from mice and C. elegans can give clues about the functional consequence of human genetic variants. Our analysis shows that many phenotypic variants in different genes from mice and C. elegans, so far, have no counterparts in humans, and thus, can be useful resources when evaluating a relationship between a new human mutation and a disease.

MODS is intended to complement other metadata formats. For some applications, particularly those that have used MARC records, there will be advantages over other metadata schemes. Some advantages are: the element set is richer than Dublin Core; the element set is more compatible with library data than ONIX; the schema is more end user oriented than the full MARCXML schema; the element set is simpler than the full MARC format. Please note that round-tripping between MARC 21 and MODS is not guaranteed.

FAIRsharing.o8TYnW	FAIR Metrics - Resource Identifier in Metadata	FM-F3	FM-F3 provides a measurement of whether or not the metadata document contains the globally unique and persistent identifier for the digital resource. The discovery of a digital object should be possible from its metadata. For this to happen, the metadata must explicitly contain the identifier for the digital resource it describes. In addition, since many digital objects cannot be arbitrarily extended to include references to their metadata, in many cases the only means to discover the metadata related to a digital object will be to search based on the GUID of the digital object itself. To this end, the GUID of the metadata and the GUID of the digital resource it describes must be provided. This metric applies to part F3 of the FAIR Principles.

FAIRsharing.ochiOn	IVOA Standard for Unified Content Descriptors	IVOA UCD	The IVOA Standard for Unified Content Descriptors document describes the current understanding of the IVOA controlled vocabulary for describing astronomical data quantities, called Unified Content Descriptors (UCDs). The present document defines a new standard (named UCD1+) improving the first generation of UCDs (UCD1). The basic idea is to adopt a new syntax and vocabulary requiring little effort for people to adapt software already using UCD1. This document also addresses the questions of maintenance and evolution of the UCD1+. Examples of use cases within the Virtual Observatory and tools for using UCD1+ are also described.
FAIRsharing.OcXwxA	Virtual Observatory Data Modeling Language	VO-DML	The Virtual Observatory Data Modeling Language (VO-DML) defines a standard modelling language, or meta-model, for expressing data models in the IVOA. Adopting such a uniform language for all models allows these to be used in a homogeneous manner and allows a consistent definition of reuse of one model by another. The particular language defined here includes a consistent identification mechanism for model which allows these to be referenced in an explicit and uniform manner also from other contexts, in particular from othe IVOA standard formats such as VOTable. The language defined in this specification is named VO-DML (VO Data Modeling Language). VO-DML is a conceptual modeling language that is agnostic of serializations, or physical representations. This allows it to be designed to fit as many purposes as possible. VO-DML is directly based on UML, and can be seen as a particular representation of a UML2 Profile. VO-DML is restricted to describing static data structures and from UML it only uses a subset of the elements defined in its language for describing "Class Diagrams". Its concepts can be easily mapped to equivalent data modelling concepts in other representations such as relational databases, XML schemas and object-oriented computer languages. VO-DML has a representation as a simple XML dialect named VO-DML/XML that must be used to provide the formal representation of a VO-DML data model. VO-DML/XML aims to be concise, explicit and easy to parse and use in code that needs to interpret annotated data sets. VO-DML as described in this document is an example of a domain specific modeling language, where the domain here is defined as the set of data and meta-data structures handled in the IVOA and Astronomy at large. VO-DML provides a custom representation of such a language and as a side effect allows the creation and use of standards compliant data models outside of the IVOA standards context.

EPSRC recognises that a range of institutional policies and practices can satisfy these expectations, and encourages research organisations to develop specific approaches which, while aligned with EPSRC’s expectations, are appropriate to their own structures and cultures. The expectations arise from seven core principles which align with the core RCUK principles on data sharing. Two of the principles are of particular importance: firstly, that publicly funded research data should generally be made as widely and freely available as possible in a timely and responsible manner; and, secondly, that the research process should not be damaged by the inappropriate release of such data.

Using state-of-the-art repeat detection methods and manual curation, we systematically annotated the Protein Data Bank, predicting 10 745 repeat structures. In all, 2797 structures were classified according to a recently proposed classification schema, which was expanded to accommodate new findings. In addition, detailed annotations were performed in a subset of 321 proteins. These annotations feature information on start and end positions for the repeat regions and units. RepeatsDB is an ongoing effort to systematically classify and annotate structural protein repeats in a consistent way. It provides users with the possibility to access and download high-quality datasets either interactively or programmatically through web services.

FAIRsharing.qUroF6	FAIR Maturity Indicator Gen2-MI-I1A	None	The FAIR Maturity Indicator Gen2-MI-I1A measures the use of a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation. The unambiguous communication of knowledge and meaning (what symbols are, and how they relate to one another) necessitates the use of languages that are capable of representing these concepts in a machine-readable manner. There is debate in the community about what languages would be considered "knowledge representation languages", as such this Maturity Indicator is broken into two sub-MIs (Gen2-FM-I1A and Gen2-FM-I1B). This MI takes a loose definition, that any kind of structured information is sufficient.

FAIRsharing.qz30cx	GlycoCT sequence format for carbohydrates.	GlycoCT XML	GlycoCT format is devised to describe the carbohydrate sequences, with a controlled vocabulary to name monosaccharides, adopting IUPAC rules to generate a consistent, machine-readable nomenclature, based on a connection table approach, instead of a linear encoding scheme. The format uses a block concept to describe frequently occurring special features of carbohydrate sequences like repeating units. It exists in two variants, a condensed form and a more verbose XML syntax. Sorting rules assure the uniqueness of the condensed form, thus making it suitable as a direct primary key for database applications, which rely on unique identifiers. GlycoCT encompasses the capabilities of the heterogeneous landscape of digital encoding schemata in glycomics and is thus a step forward on the way to a unified and broadly accepted sequence format in glycobioinformatics.
FAIRsharing.qzrbk	Taxonomic Concept transfer Schema	TCS	The development of an abstract model for a taxonomic concept, which can capture the various models represented and understood by the various data providers, is central to this project. This model is presented as an XML schema document that is proposed as a standard to allow exchange of data between different data models. It aims to capture data as understood by the data owners without distortion, and facilitate the query of different data resources according to the common schema model. The TCS schema was conceived to allow the representation of taxonomic concepts as defined in published taxonomic classifications, revisions and databases. As such, it specifies the structure for XML documents to be used for the transfer of defined concepts. Valid transfer documents may either explicitly detail the defining components of taxon concepts, transfer GUIDs referring to defined taxon concepts (if and when these are available) or a mixture of the two.

It aims at providing a simple model easy to understand and to implement by data providers that wish to publish their data into the Virtual Observatory. This interface integrates data modeling and data access aspects in a single service and is named ObsTAP. In this document, the Observation Data Model Core Components (ObsCoreDM) defines the core components of queryable metadata required for global discovery of observational data. It is meant to allow a single query to be posed to TAP services at multiple sites to perform global data discovery without having to understand the details of the services present at each site. It defines a minimal set of basic metadata and thus allows for a reasonable cost of implementation by data providers.

FAIRsharing.RYXNBS	Space-Time Coordinate Metadata for the Virtual Observatory	STC	The Space-Time Coordinate (STC) metadata for the Virtual Observatory provides a standard for users to specify the spatial coordinates they work in; these will, for most astronomical users, be some flavor of equatorial coordinates. However, there are many variations, not only in terms of different equatorial systems, either from historical collections (FK1-4) or in the uses of Galactic or ecliptic coordinates, but also geographic, barycentric, planetocentric, and instrumental detector coordinates, most of them in spherical as well as Cartesian form. In addition, high-accuracy requirements and special situations such as spacecraft-based observatories create the need for specifying the origin of such coordinate frames – in most cases the location of the observatory. The same is true for time and spectral coordinates: for many applications it may not matter, but there are situations where it is crucial to know what timescale was used, where time was measured, or what inertial standard of rest was used to express the frequency. What this amounts to is that for spatial coordinates it is necessary to know the coordinate system (its type and orientation) and the origin that were used, for time the timescale (UTC, TT, TAI, TDB, etc.) and the spatial reference position, for the spectral coordinate the origin in phase space, and for redshifts (Doppler velocity) the definition as well as the phase space origin. This standard explains the various components, highlights some implementation considerations, presents a complete set of UML diagrams, and discusses the relation between STC and certain other parts of the Data Model. Two serializations are described in this standard document: XML Schema (STC-X) and String (STC-S); the former is an integral part of this Recommendation.

FAIRsharing.SFORSe	Sex-Associated Gene Database	SAGD	Many animal species present sex differences. Sex-associated genes (SAGs), which have female-biased or male-biased expression, have major influences on the remarkable sex differences in important traits such as growth, reproduction, disease resistance and behaviors. However, the SAGs resulting in the vast majority of phenotypic sex differences are still unknown. To provide a useful resource for the functional study of SAGs, we manually curated public RNA-seq datasets with paired female and male biological replicates from the same condition and systematically re-analyzed the datasets using standardized methods. We identified 27,793 female-biased SAGs and 64,043 male-biased SAGs from 2,828 samples of 21 species, including human, chimpanzee, macaque, mouse, rat, cow, horse, chicken, zebrafish, seven fly species and five worm species. All these data were cataloged into SAGD, a user-friendly database of SAGs where users can browse SAGs by gene, species, drug, and dataset. In SAGD, the expression, annotation, targeting drugs, homologs, ontology and related RNA-seq datasets of SAGs are provided to help researchers to explore their functions and potential applications in agriculture and human health.

FAIRsharing.sv2rm8	TissueNet v.2	TissueNet	Knowledge of the molecular interactions of human proteins within tissues is important for identifying their tissue-specific roles and for shedding light on tissue phenotypes. However, many protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have no tissue-contexts. The TissueNet database bridges this gap by associating experimentally-identified PPIs with human tissues that were shown to express both pair-mates. Users can select a protein and a tissue, and obtain a network view of the query protein and its tissue-associated PPIs. TissueNet v.2 is an updated version of the TissueNet database previously featured in NAR. It includes over 40 human tissues profiled via RNA-sequencing or protein-based assays. Users can select their preferred expression data source and interactively set the expression threshold for determining tissue-association. The output of TissueNet v.2 underlines qualitative and quantitative features of query proteins and their PPIs. The tissue-specificity view highlights tissue-specific and globally-expressed proteins, and the quantitative view highlights proteins that were differentially expressed in the selected tissue relative to all other tissues. Together, these views allow users to quickly assess the unique versus global functionality of query proteins. Thus, TissueNet v.2 offers an extensive, quantitative and user-friendly interface to study the roles of human proteins across tissues.

FAIRsharing.svzbnp	DEscription Language for TAxonomy	DELTA	When taxonomic descriptions are prepared for input to computer programs, the form of the coding is usually dictated by the requirements of a particular program or set of programs. This restricts the type of data that can be represented, and the number of other programs that can use the data. Even when working with a particular program, it is frequently necessary to set up different versions of the same basic data, for example, when using restricted sets of taxa or characters to make special-purpose keys. The potential advantages of automation, especially in connexion with large groups, cannot be realized if the data have to be restructured by hand for every operation. The DELTA (DEscription Language for TAxonomy) system was developed to overcome these problems. It was designed primarily for easy use by people rather than for convenience in computer programming, and is versatile enough to replace the written description as the primary means of recording data. Consequently, it can be used as a shorthand method of recording data, even if computer processing of the data is not envisaged.

FAIRsharing.tghhc4	Pipeline Patterns Ontology	PP	To answer the need for a workflow representing a sequence of data transformations, a high-level process ontology was defined, denoted Pipeline Patterns (PP) ontology.  Every concept is generically a Data (class from EDAM), which can be further specified as an Entry (P:00002) or an Exit (P:00009). All Entries can be subjected to an Operation (class from EDAM) producing an Intermediate (P:00010). An Intermediate has a TemporalEntity associated to represent its time of creation. Some Entries are specifically of the type Exit, meaning that they will represent concepts that exit the current category and be passed to the next one on the workflow. Additionally, in order to permit the treatment of a set of objects as a single entity, this high-level ontology considers the concept of List (P:00004) and more specifically an Aggregate (P:00005), containing a set of Data or Entry, respectively. The concept Intermediate is an Entry, allowing for the successive application of an operation to an Element. This is particularly useful in the case of the application of sequential set of operations.

FAIRsharing.tnu8V7	Data Quality Vocabulary	DQV	Aiming to facilitate the publication of such data quality information on the Web, especially in the growing area of data catalogues, the W3C Data Web Best Practices Working (DWBP) group has developed the Data Quality Vocabulary (DQV). DQV is a (meta)data model implemented as an RDF vocabulary with properties and classes suitable for expressing the quality of datasets and their distributions. DQV has been conceived as a high-level, interoperable framework that must accommodate various views over data quality. DQV does not seek to determine what "quality" means. Quality lies in the eye of the beholder; and there is no objective, ideal definition of it. Some datasets will be judged as low-quality resources by some data consumers, while they will perfectly fit others' needs. There are heuristics designed to fit specific assessment situations that rely on quality indicators, such as pieces of data content, pieces of data meta-information and human ratings, to give indications about the suitability of data for some intended use. DQV re-uses the notions of quality dimensions, categories and metrics to represent various approaches to data quality assessments. It also stresses the importance of allowing different actors to assess the quality of datasets and publish their annotations, certificates, or mere opinions about a dataset.

FAIRsharing.V52Eqe	PolyASite	PolyASite	Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) of RNAs gives rise to isoforms with different terminal exons, which in turn determine the fate of the RNA and the encoded protein. APA has thus been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and disease development. PolyASite is a portal to the curated set of poly(A) sites inferred from publicly available 3’ end sequencing datasets. It allows efficient finding, exploration and export of poly(A) sites in several organisms. In constructing our poly(A) site atlas, we applied uniform quality measures, including the flagging of putative internal priming sites, to input datasets originating from different 3’ end sequencing techniques, cell types or tissues. Through integrated processing of all data, we identified and clustered sites that are closely spaced and share polyadenylation signals, as these are likely the result of stochastic variations in processing. For each cluster, we identified the representative - most frequently processed - site and estimated the relative use in the transcriptome across all samples. While other existing alternative polyadenylation databases rely on a single experimental method, or on poly(A) site estimation from RNA-seq data, PolyASite is built on data from several 3’ end sequencing techniques. This allows a broader coverage of cell types and poly(A) sites to support further genomics studies.

FAIRsharing.wf28wm	UniProt Taxonomy	UP Taxonomy	The taxonomy database that is maintained by the UniProt group is based on the NCBI taxonomy database, which is supplemented with data specific to the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB). While the NCBI taxonomy is updated daily to be in sync with GenBank/EMBL-Bank/DDBJ, the UniProt taxonomy is updated only at UniProt releases to be in sync with UniProtKB. It may therefore happen that for the time period of a UniProt release, you can find new taxa at the NCBI that are not yet in UniProt (and vice versa for deleted taxa). Species with manually annotated and reviewed protein sequences in the Swiss-Prot section of UniProtKB are named according to UniProt nomenclature. In particular, we have adopted a systematic convention for naming viral and bacterial strains and isolates.

FAIRsharing.wgfrmg	Crop Ontology	CO	Created in 2008 by the CGIAR, the Crop Ontology (CO; http://www.cropontology.org) is an essential source of traits and variables to support the standardization of the breeding databases such as the Integrated Breeding Platform’s BMS (IBP; https://www.integratedbreeding.net/) and the Boyce Thompson Institute’s Breedbase (https://breedbase.org/) (Arnaud et al., 2020). By providing descriptions of agronomic, morphological, physiological, quality, and stress traits along with their definitions and relationships, also including a standard nomenclature for composing the variables, the CO enables digital capture and aggregation of crop trait data, as well as comparison across projects and locations (Shrestha et al, 2012). The crop ontologies follow a conceptual model that defines a phenotypic variable as a combination of a trait, a method and a scale. This model aims at supporting the creation and management of breeders’ field books and the generation of annotated trial data. Annotated data are interpretable, interoperable and reusable. The development of a crop-specific ontology is a community-driven effort which is usually coordinated by a curator (or curators) nominated from within the community itself. CO’s Traits that are properly described following the guidelines are progressively mapped to the Planteome species-neutral Trait Ontology (TO) maintained by Oregon State University.

The resulting draft FAIR Principles were initially made available for public comment via the websites of peer-initiatives such as, for example, Force11. Based on this feedback, the final Principles were published in 2016 (https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618).  FAIR is a set of guiding principles to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable. These guidelines provide advice for those wishing to enhance the (re)usability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals.

It includes a crowdsourcing tool that allows genes to be added or reviewed by experts throughout the worldwide scientific community, providing an opportunity for the standardisation of gene panels, and a consensus on which genes have sufficient evidence for disease association. The diagnostic grade ‘Green’ genes and their modes of inheritance in the Version 1+ PanelApp virtual gene panels are used to direct the variant tiering process for the interpretation of genomes in the 100,000 Genomes Project and for the National Health Service England Genomic Medicine Service. As panels in PanelApp are publically available, they can also be utilised by others. Experts are asked to register (https://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk/accounts/registration/) in order to review and rate the genes on the panel to indicate whether there is a diagnostic-grade level of evidence for the gene to be implicated in a given disease. Bioinformaticians can access the data via the PanelApp API (https://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk/#!API). More detailed background information, instructions and updates can be found on the PanelApp homepage tabs.

FAIRsharing.ztr3n9	FAIR Metrics - Machine-readability of metadata	FM-F2	FM-F2 measures the availability of machine-readable metadata that describes a digital resource. This metric does not attempt to measure (or even define) "Richness" - this will be defined in a future Metric. This metric is intended to test the format of the metadata - machine readability of metadata makes it possible to optimize discovery. For instance, Web search engines suggest the use of particular structured metadata elements to optimize search. Thus, the machine-readability aspect can help people and machines find a digital resource of interest. To conform to this metric, a URL to a document that contains machine-readable metadata for the digital resource must be provided. Furthermore, the file format must be specified. This metric applies to part F2 of the FAIR Principles.

FAIRsharing.zvytda	International Classification of Primary Care Version 2 PLUS	ICPC-2 PLUS	The International Classification of Primary Care Version 2 PLUS (ICPC-2 PLUS, also known as the BEACH coding system) is a clinical terminology which extends the International Classification of Primary Care, Version 2 (ICPC-2). ICPC-2 PLUS can be used in age-sex disease registers, morbidity registers and full electronic health records in primary care. Primarily used in Australia, ICPC-2 PLUS is used within software packages and electronic health record (EHR) systems. It is also used in research projects, including the BEACH (Bettering the Evaluation And Care of Health) program, the national study of general practice activity. The terminology is therefore often referred to as the BEACH coding system.  ICPC-2 PLUS has been specifically designed by the FMRC for use in computerised clinical systems, recall systems, disease registers and secondary coding of clinical data. It is not part of the ICPC-2 standard. Charges apply for end users of ICPC-2 PLUS. All end users must sign an ICPC-2 PLUS end user contract before being given access to ICPC-2 PLUS. The World Organization of Family Doctors (WONCA) and the WONCA International Classification Committee (WICC) have no control over it although they do have control over the ICPC classification which the PLUS extension makes use of.

Data for Rearrangement objects are stored as rows in a tab-delimited file and should be compatible with any TSV reader. A dataset is defined in this context as: a TSV file, a TSV with a companion YAML file containing metadata, or a directory containing multiple TSV files and YAML files.
FAIRsharing.ZXDCn7	Policies for IP/ Licensing for Data and Resources Generated by IDG Members	None	It is imperative to avoid restrictive accessibility to the broad scientific community when establishing licenses and sharing practices, especially with consideration to the Resource Sharing Plan stated in the original IDG FOAs: “A primary goal of the IDG Program is to facilitate discoveries of the broad scientific community for the improvement of public health. Restrictive licensing and sharing practices for IDG-generated data, tools, and resources could substantially diminish their value and public benefit. Accordingly, awardees should manage data, resources, protocols, tools, and software in a way that achieves this goal. Sharing practices that would prevent or block access to or use of IDG Program data, tools, and resources for research purposes will be considered to be hindering the goals of the IDG Program.” IDG members remain committed to this goal of the IDG Program and it will be utilized as guidance for allowing access of resources.
