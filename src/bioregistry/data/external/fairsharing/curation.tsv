FAIRsharing.119q9t	UMLS Semantic Network	None	The US National Library of Medicine has developed the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), whose goal it is to provide integrated access to a large number of biomedical resources by unifying the vocabularies that are used to access those resources. The UMLS Metathesaurus interrelates more than 150 controlled vocabularies in the biomedical domain. The UMLS coverage is quite extensive, including not only many concepts in clinical medicine, but also a large number of concepts applicable to the broad domain of the life sciences. In order to provide an overarching conceptual framework for all UMLS concepts, the UMLS Semantic Network, an upper-level ontology, has been developed. The Semantic Network provides a consistent categorization of all concepts represented in the UMLS Metathesaurus. The links between the semantic types provide the structure for the network and represent important relationships in the biomedical domain. The Semantic Network consists of (1) a set of broad subject categories, or Semantic Types, that provide a consistent categorization of all concepts represented in the UMLS Metathesaurus, and (2) a set of useful and important relationships, or Semantic Relations, that exist between Semantic Types.

FAIRsharing.2rm2b3	W3C Provenance Ontology	PROV-O	The PROV Ontology (PROV-O) expresses the PROV Data Model using the OWL2 Web Ontology Language (OWL2). It is intended for the Linked Data and Semantic Web community. It provides a set of classes, properties, and restrictions that can be used to represent and interchange provenance information generated in different systems and under different contexts. It can also be specialized to create new classes and properties to model provenance information for different applications and domains. PROV-O is one serialization of PROV-DM, the other two being PROV-N and PROV-XML. PROV-DM and PROV-O define how to represent provenance on the World Wide Web, and as such additional documentation has been included in this record for PROV-AQ (Access and Query), a note which describes how standard web protocols may be used to locate, retrieve and query provenance records. PROV-DC provides a mapping from Dublin Core to PROV-O, and is listed in this record. For the purpose of this specification, provenance is defined as a record that describes the people, institutions, entities, and activities involved in producing, influencing, or delivering a piece of data or a thing. In particular, the provenance of information is crucial in deciding whether information is to be trusted, how it should be integrated with other diverse information sources, and how to give credit to its originators when reusing it. In an open and inclusive environment such as the Web, where users find information that is often contradictory or questionable, provenance can help those users to make trust judgements.
FAIRsharing.2rzyrx	Dispedia Core Ontology	DCO	Dispedia Core Ontology is a schema for information brokering and knowledge management in the complex field of rare diseases. On the one hand, the Dispedia schema uses semantic technologies to describe patients affected by rare diseases, and on the other hand, to record expertise concerning these particular diseases in machine-processable form. In addition to the differentiated attribution of facts to the individual need for information, Dispedia enables information brokering which adjusts to the type of recipient, its character as well as its personal attitude. The schema was initially geared to an exemplified disease, Amyotrophe Lateralsclerose (ALS).
FAIRsharing.2xahkx	Neuroscience Information Framework Dysfunction	NIFDYS	This ontology contains the former BIRNLex-Disease, version 1.3.2. -- The BIRN Project lexicon will provide entities for data and database annotation for the BIRN project, covering anatomy, disease, data collection, project management and experimental design. It is built using the organizational framework provided by the foundational Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It uses an abstract biomedical layer on top of that - OBO-UBO which has been constructed as a proposal to the OBO Foundry. This is meant to support creating a sharable view of core biomedical objects such as biomaterial_entity, and organismal_entity that all biomedical ontologies are likely to need and want to use with the same intended meaning. The BIRNLex was intended to serve as the basis for construction of a formal ontology for the multiscale investigation of neurological disease.

It focuses on the management of antibiotics resistance within hospitals and infectious diseases to cover the clinical monitoring use cases. The ontology shall provide a semantic reference as logically defined classes in a formal and computer understandable format. It is supposed to formally represent all basic kinds of entities in the domain of interest, together with their invariant and context-independent properties. The ontology is therefore distinct from the representation of clinical knowledge as targeted by the DebugIT WP 4. Instead, it has a supportive semantic glue Function as it provides standardized and formally described meaning identifiers across the whole project, hence serving the Interoperability platform as well.

FAIRsharing.3dm6gm	Edinburgh Human Developmental Anatomy	EHDA	A structured controlled vocabulary of stage-specific anatomical structures of the human. It has been designed to mesh with the mouse anatomy (EMAP ontology) and incorporates each Carnegie stage of development (CS1-20). The timed version of the human developmental anatomy ontology gives all the tissues present at each Carnegie Stage (CS) of human development (1-20) linked by a part-of rule. Each term is mentioned only once so that the embryo at each stage can be seen as the simple sum of its parts. Users should note that tissues that are symmetric (e.g. eyes, ears, limbs) are only mentioned once. The EHDA; Hunter et al. 2003 is less complete than later versions: it comprises a set of ontologies, one for each Carnegie stage (CS) (1–20) that only includes basic part_of data. Its structure was derived from the original EMAP ontology, and its content was based partly on this and partly on a limited study of sectioned human material.
FAIRsharing.3fc9zf	openEHR Health Record Specification	openEHR	openEHR is an open standard that uses a novel two-level modelling methodology to represent health information and meta-data by preserving the semantics during when it were created. It enables semantic interoperability and makes it possible to link disparate data sources easily and safely. It also allows for terminology binding which provides the bridge between the 'terminology' and 'information model' this making it much more useful than using these standards separately. Although openEHR is a de-facto standard that is developed by volunteers openly, ISO and CEN adopted it (ISO/EN 13606) so it is a full international standard. It has relationship and mappings between other standards, such as HL7.
FAIRsharing.3ftws4	Ontology of Geographical Region	OGR	This OWL ontology classified the geograhical regions related vocabularies extracted from UMLS.

FAIRsharing.4ghkfj	Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms for Library and Archival Materials	LCGFT	The Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms for Library and Archival Materials (LCGFT) is a thesaurus that describes what a work is versus what it is about. For instance, the subject heading Horror films, with appropriate subdivisions, would be assigned to a book about horror films. A cataloger assigning headings to the movie The Texas Chainsaw Massacre would also use Horror films, but it would be a genre/form term since the movie is a horror film, not a movie about horror films. The thesaurus combines both genres and forms. Form is defined as a characteristic of works with a particular format and/or purpose. A "short" is a particular form, for example, as is "animation." Genre refers to categories of works that are characterized by similar plots, themes, settings, situations, and characters.

FAIRsharing.69734m	Medical Educational Resource Aggregator	MERA	The educational resource ontology is designed in order to provide structure to resources aggregated by the educational resource aggregator. The aim of the educational resource aggregator is to harvest educational resources from 3rd party repositories, present these to the medical expert for annotation and rating, and output the results of the annotation (together with resource metadata) to the CARRE public RDF repository. The main parts of this aggregator are: the Resource Retriever, the Resource Rating, the Resource Metadata Processing, and the User Application. The educational metadata involve the Resource Metadata processing module.This module is a combination of 3 services that collect data per article, making multiple SPARQL requests to enrich the data and finally store it as a unique identified resource into the local datastore. Then data is transformed into RDF triples in order to be inserted to CARRE educational repository. The ontology is developed using the Protégé v5.0 , a free, open-source ontology editor from the Stanford University. The ontology is available on CARRE rdf repository among the other ontologies. CARRE url : http://carre.kmi.open.ac.uk/ontology/educational.owl

FAIRsharing.6ehjqt	Material Rock	MATRROCK	This resource is no longer available because its underlying source material does not exist.
FAIRsharing.6gs502	Stuff Ontology	STUFF	Multiple domain ontologies have various representations of types of stuff--also called matter, mass, or substance--such as milk, alcohol, and mud. This is modelled in a range of different ways that are not quite compatible with each other as they do not adhere to a single structured approach, at times not even within an ontology itself. The Stuff Ontology is a 'bridging' core ontology describing categories of stuff and formalised in OWL for purposes of implementability. It stands on its own, but there are also versions that link to the DOLCE and BFO foundational ontologies, and one with examples to illustrate classification of stuffs (among others, mayonnaise and gold). This then also resolves the main type of interoperability issues with stuffs in domain ontologies, thereby also contributing to better ontology quality.
FAIRsharing.6mck	Children's Health Exposure Analysis Resource	CHEAR	Children's health and wellbeing are influenced by interactions between environmental and genetic factors. NIEHS is establishing an infrastructure, the Children's Health Exposure Analysis Resource (CHEAR), to provide the extramural research community access to laboratory and data analyses that add or expand the inclusion of environmental exposures in children's health research. The goal of CHEAR is to provide tools so researchers can assess the full range of environmental exposures which may affect children's health. We anticipate that CHEAR will be used by children's health researchers conducting epidemiological or clinical studies that currently have limited consideration of environmental exposures, or those who have collected exposure data but seek more extensive analyses.
FAIRsharing.6mmbzs	Protein-ligand interaction ontology	PLIO	The protein--ligand interaction ontology (PLIO) was developed around three main concepts, namely target, ligand and interaction, and was enriched by adding synonyms, useful annotations and references. PLIO represents knowledge about the interaction of proteins and ligands (including drugs) and has a different scope and conceptual resolution than, for example, the molecular interaction ontology. An important feature of PLIO is that it links directly from an ontology framework describing protein–ligand interactions to the mathematical formulas relevant for the computation of some of the entities represented in the ontology.

FAIRsharing.8337e2	Integrated Authority File	GND	The Integrated Authority File (GND) is a service facilitating the collaborative use and administration of authority data. These authority data represent and describe entities, i.e. persons, corporate bodies, conferences and events, geographic entities, topics and works relating to cultural and academic collections. Libraries in particular use the GND to catalogue publications. However, archives, museums, cultural and academic institutions, and researchers involved in research projects are also increasingly working with the GND. Authority data make cataloguing easier, offer definitive search entries and forge links between different information resources. Every entity in the GND features a unique and stable identifier (GND ID). This makes it possible to link the authority data with both each other and external data sets and web resources. This results in a cross-organisational, machine-readable data network.

FAIRsharing.9xcr4z	CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model	CIDOC-CRM	The CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) provides definitions and a formal structure for describing the implicit and explicit concepts and relationships used in cultural heritage documentation. The overall scope of the CIDOC CRM can be summarised in simple terms as the curated, factual knowledge
about the past at a human scale. The CIDOC CRM is intended to promote a shared understanding of cultural heritage information by providing a common and extensible semantic framework that any cultural heritage information can be mapped to. It is intended to be a common language for domain experts and implementers to formulate requirements for information systems and to serve as a guide for good practice of conceptual modelling. In this way, it can provide the "semantic glue" needed to mediate between different sources of cultural heritage information, such as that published by museums, libraries and archives. The ISO 21127:2014 specification (Information and documentation — A reference ontology for the interchange of cultural heritage information) was created from the CIDOC CRM, although the CIDOC CRM Special Interest Group continues to maintain this original document as well.
FAIRsharing.9y3gv0	Enzyme Structure Function Ontology	ESFO	The ESFO provides a new paradigm for organizing enzyme sequence, structure, and function information, whereby specific elements of enzyme sequence and structure are mapped to specific conserved aspects of function, thus facilitating the functional annotation of uncharacterized enzymes. The ESFO helps prevent misannotation by emphasizing annotation of enzymes only at the level of functional granularity warranted by available information. The archive is a static snapshot of the data in the SFLD as of April 2019, and will not be updated

FAIRsharing.abxd9x	Teleost Anatomy Ontology	TAO	TAO is a multi-species ontology for teleost fishes that was initialized with terms from the Zebrafish Anatomical Ontology (ZFA). The development of the TAO focused on the skeletal system because it varies significantly across fishes, is well-preserved in fossil specimens, and it is often the focus of morphologically-based evolutionary studies in ichthyology. Note that TAO is a deprecated ontology and has been superceded by Uberon.
FAIRsharing.ae8hpt	Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering	DOLCE	DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering) is a foundational ontology developed as part of the WonderWeb Foundational Ontologies Library (WFOL).  The development of this library has been guided by the need of a reliable set of foundational ontologies that can serve as 1) astarting point for building other ontologies, 2) a reference point for easy and rigorous comparisons among different ontological approaches, and 3) a rigorous basis for analyzing, harmonizing and integrating existing ontologies and metadata standards (by manually mapping them into some general module(s) in the library). DOLCE is the first module of WFOL and it is not a candidate for a universal standard ontology. Rather, it is intended as a starting point for comparing and elucidating the relationships with the other modules of the library, and also for clarifying the hidden assumptions underlying existing ontologies or linguistic resources such as WordNet.  As reflected by its acronym, DOLCE has a clear cognitive bias, in the sense that it aims at capturing the ontological categories underlying natural language and human commonsense. DOLCE is an ontology that focuses on particulars in the sense that its domain of discourse is restricted to them. The project is complete, though the ontology remains available for use.
FAIRsharing.aef0q5	Cognitive Atlas	CogAt	The Cognitive Atlas is a collaborative knowledge building project that aims to develop a knowledge base (or ontology) that characterizes the state of current thought in cognitive science.

The larger VIVO software is an open source platform for research discovery. Content in any local VIVO installation may be maintained manually, brought into VIVO in automated ways from local systems of record, such as HR, grants, course, and faculty activity databases, or from database providers such as publication aggregators and funding agencies.
FAIRsharing.an9ct0	BioMedBridges Diabetes Ontology	DIAB	The BioMedBridges diabetes-specific ontology enables users to integrate data resources related to prediabetes, diabetes, and late consequences/complications of diabetes. Data integration between mouse disease models and human studies is hindered by fundamental differences in the ontologies used by the respective communities to describe the same phenotypes. Common standards and ontologies to bridge the phenotype gap between mouse and human open extensive mouse phenotype data to clinical researchers. 

To develop a comprehensive set of terms to describe Type 2 diabetes and obesity phenotypes in mouse and human, Type 2 Diabetes-related phenotypes were mined from the literature for use as new phenotype terms. Expert clinicians/diabetologists then curated the mined terms and categorised them by temporal disease stages. The ontology was then used for the annotation of mouse and human datasets with specific terminology representing Type 2 Diabetes progression, which will ultimately support translational research.
FAIRsharing.aqnss4	thesaurus	thesaurus	"thesaurus" is a standard that was listed on BioPortal. However, it has been subsequently removed.

FAIRsharing.f8cd83	Climate and Forecast Standard Names Parameter Vocabulary	CF Standard Names	The Climate and Forecast Standard Names Parameter Vocabulary (CF Standard Names) is intended for use with climate and forecast data in the atmosphere, surface and ocean domains. The CF Standard Names are the list of standard names used by the CF conventions. The list includes the units recommended for each standard name (most common prefixes can be used with the units, e.g. kilo (k), hecto (h), Mega (M), etc). If a standard_name metadata attribute is associated with a data variable, its value must be chosen from the list published in the standard name table. It is not compulsory within the CF conventions to assign a standard name to a data variable, but including one helps data users to understand the contents of a netCDF file. A CF standard name is not a netCDF variable name, but instead a value for the standard_name variable attribute. A standard_name attribute identifies the physical quantity of a variable.
FAIRsharing.faej7j	Phallusia mammillata Anatomy and Development Ontology	PHMAMMADO	The first ontology describing the anatomy and the development of Phallusia mammillata.

Incorporation and comparison of various small molecule screening data sets, such as those deposited in PubChem, ChEMBL, KEGG, PDSP, and/or IUPHAR databases, requires a formalized electronic organization system. In order to bridge the gap between the overflow of HTS data and the bottleneck of integrated analysis tools, herein, we provide the first comprehensive GPCR ontology. The development and utility of GPCR ontology was based on previously developed BioAssay Ontology (BAO). The GPCR ontology contains information about biochemical, pharmacological, and functional properties of individual GPCRs as well as GPCR-selective ligands inclusive of their HTS screening results and other records. This provides the first all-inclusive GPCR ontology with all available data to model the relationship between the GPCR binding sites and their physiologic and pharmacologic role in physiology via small molecule chemical structures. We developed this system using emerging semantic technologies, by leveraging existing and descriptive domain level ontologies.

FAIRsharing.fr3ng0	Edinburgh Human Developmental Anatomy Abstract	EHDAA	A structured controlled vocabulary of stage-specific anatomical structures of the human. It has been designed to mesh with the mouse anatomy (EMAP ontology) and incorporates each Carnegie stage of development (CS1-20). This abstract version of the human developmental anatomy ontology compresses all the tissues present over Carnegie stages 1-20 into a single hierarchy. The heart, for example, is present from Carnegie Stage 9 onwards and is thus represented by 12 EHDA IDs (one for each stage). In the abstract mouse, it has a single ID so that the abstract term given as just heart really means heart (CS 9-20). This ontology was made computationally and later deemed "incoherent" by the authors because the stage-dependent hierarchical structures were not integrated.

FAIRsharing.hs43fc	Fish Ontology	FISHO	This Fish Ontology is an ontology created as how the author views the fish structure following the book "The Diversity of Fishes: Biology, Evolution and Ecology" as the main reference, which covers one part of view on ichthyology, with an emphasis on diversity and adaptation. This ontology is created with the mindset of categorizing fish automatically based on the attributes and terms mined from the fish specimen. Most of the basic organization from this ontology follows Nelson's research due to its synthetic and broad approach, while recognizing that Nelson's conclusions are one of many alternative interpretations of the literature, which is mostly agreed by our main references, and many fish and fisheries researchers. Most of the classification used in this ontology is in no means completed and just following the recent classification provided by the books For now our work focused more on two group of fish which is early jawless fish, and advanced jawed fishes. The classification from both of this group are structured following the reference.

FAIRsharing.j2np9m	Menelas Project Top-Level Ontology	TOP-MENELAS	The two main goals MENELAS contributes to are to (i) Provide better account of and better access to medical information through natural languages in order to help physicians in their daily practice, and to (ii) Enhance European cooperation by multilingual access to standardised medical nomenclatures. The major achievements of MENELAS are the realisation of its two functional systems: (i) The Document Indexing System encodes free text PDSs into both an internal representation (a set of Conceptual Graphs) and international nomenclature codes (ICD-9-CM). Instances of the Document Indexing System have been realised for French, English and Dutch ; (ii) The Consultation System allows users to access the information contained in PDSs previously indexed by the Document Indexing System. The test domain for the project was coronary diseases. The existing prototype shows promising results for information retrieval from natural language PDSs and for automatically encoding PDSs into an existing classification such as ICD-9-CM. A set of components, tools, knowledge bases and methods has also been produced by the project. These include language-independent ontology and models for the domain of coronary diseases; conceptual description of the relevant ICD-9-CM codes. This ontology includes a top-ontology, a top-domain ontology and a domain ontology (Coronay diseases surgery). The menelas-top ontology here is the part of the whole ontology without any reference to medical domain.

FAIRsharing.jT49Da	Provenance Vocabulary	None	The Provenance Vocabulary provides classes and properties for describing provenance of Web data. The vocabulary focuses on two main use cases: 1.) It enables consumers of Web data to describe provenance of data retrieved from the Web and of data derived from such Web data. 2.) It enables providers of Web data to publish provenance-related metadata about their data. Notice, the vocabulary is not intended for describing provenance of other kinds of Web content. The Provenance Vocabulary is designed as a Web data specific specialization of the W3C PROV Ontology (PROV-O); classes and properties provided by the vocabulary are domain specific extensions of the more general concepts introduced in PROV-O. As a consequence, any Provenance Vocabulary based description of provenance can be easily interpreted and exchanged according to the W3C PROV family of standards. While this vocabulary is in a stable state, it is not being actively developed at this time.

FAIRsharing.k3fp3g	Read Clinical Terminology Version 2	Read v2	Read Codes are a coded thesaurus of clinical terms. They have been used in the NHS since 1985. There are two versions: version 2 (v2) and version 3 (CTV3 or v3). Both versions provide a standard vocabulary for clinicians to record patient findings and procedures, in health and social care IT systems across primary and secondary care. The Read Codes were developed in 1985 by Dr. James Read. The U.K. National Health Service Centre for Coding and Classification (NHS CCC) acquired and now maintains the Read Codes. Read Codes contain hundreds of thousands of terms, synonyms, and abbreviations covering all aspects of patient care including signs and symptoms, treatments and therapies, investigations, occupations, diagnoses, and drugs and appliances. Read Codes are used by healthcare professionals in computerized information systems. Read Codes are now known as Clinical Terms. PLEASE NOTE: the retirement of Read v2 and v3 (CTV3) clinical terminologies has been scheduled.

FAIRsharing.lWbenx	Reference list of Metabolite names	RefMet	RefMet provides a standardized reference nomenclature for both discrete metabolite structures and metabolite species identified by spectroscopic techniques in metabolomics experiments. This is an essential prerequisite for the ability to compare and contrast metabolite data across different experiments and studies. Over 200,000 names from a set of over 1,100 MS and NMR studies on the Metabolomics Workbench has been used to generate a highly curated analytical chemistry-centric list of common names for metabolite structures and isobaric species. Additionally, the vast majority of these names have been linked to a metabolite classification system using a combination of LIPID MAPS and ClassyFire classification methods. A name-conversion user interface is provided where users can submit a list of metabolite names and map them to the corresponding RefMet names. New metabolites are constantly being added to RefMet, however very new metabolite names generated by metabolomics experiments may not currently map to RefMet identifiers. Nevertheless, RefMet has the ability to greatly increase the data-sharing potential of metabolomics experiments and facilitate "meta-analysis" and systems biology objectives for the majority of commonly encountered metabolite species.
FAIRsharing.m0e1s0	SoyOntology	SOY	This is a community-curated controlled vocabulary for soybean field growth stages (Soybean Whole Plant Growth Ontology), plant structure names (Soybean Structure Ontology), development (Soybean Development Ontology) and plant traits (Soybean Trait Ontology).

FAIRsharing.mp8js2	Medical Web Lifestyle Aggregator	MWLA	This ontology designed and developed in order to represent the detected intentions from the Web Lifestyle Data Aggregator. In particular, it seeks to represent what is involved in the gathering of data from the web and social lifestyle of user on the Internet. We decided, therefore, to develop the ontology using the Protégé v5.0, a free, open-source ontology editor from the Stanford University. The outcome of Protégé is available on the following URL: http://carre.kmi.open.ac.uk/ontology/lifestyle.owl The presented ontology is generic and can support different type of providers (e.g. web searches, Facebook, Twitter etc.). Additionally, the predefined intentions are also generic supporting the majority of intentions in the Web. In the context of CARRE, we utilize, as a first attempt, the web searches as provider and we only upload the relevant intentions (health and travel) to CARRE in the private RDF repository. A user (representing an individual person whose data is being represented using the terms of this ontology) has connections. A connection represents that a Web Lifestyle Data Aggregator of a particular personal computer of user provides intentions for particulars providers. A connection is therefore associated with a UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) that represents an installation of the aggregator. A provider can be the web searches, Facebook or Twitter. A measurement is associated with a provider and a connection in order to declare the connection (i.e. the Web Lifestyle Data Aggregator of a particular personal computer) from which a measurement came. Every measurement must have a date at which the detected intention was taken, a weight which defines the importance of an intention and of course the detected intention that is only relevant to CARRE.

It provides a multi-axial classification of the site, morphology, behaviour, and grading of neoplasms. The topography axis uses the ICD-10 classification of malignant neoplasms (except those categories which relate to secondary neoplasms and to specified morphological types of tumours) for all types of tumours, thereby providing greater site detail for non-malignant tumours than is provided in ICD-10. In contrast to ICD-10, the ICD-O-3 includes topography for sites of haematopoietic and reticuloendothelial tumours.

The structure of PDO centers on species, including micro level of molecular, cell and tissue, medium level of plant organs, species and population, and macro level of ecosystem. The classes of PDO also capture the habitat, environmental conditions and expand the general characteristics of plants, completing the instances richness for plant species, geographical, classification and morphology. Furthermore, PDO builds the relationships among species, region, morphology, plant organs, developmental stage, revealing the list of species in an area, the morphology and life form of plants, and development process of species. In sum, PDO shows a growth process or development stage of a species and its structure characteristics in particular space and time scale, realizing the description of species diversity, ecosystem diversity and genetic diversity. At present, PDO has been applied to the platform of Go to Selected Open Access Journals (GoOA) developed by National Science Library of Chinese Academy of Sciences, supporting concept retrieval and concept extension for GoOA.

FAIRsharing.t955dp	Read Codes Clinical Terms Version 3	CTV3	Read Codes are a coded thesaurus of clinical terms. They have been used in the NHS since 1985. There are two versions: version 2 (v2) and version 3 (CTV3 or v3). Both versions provide a standard vocabulary for clinicians to record patient findings and procedures, in health and social care IT systems across primary and secondary care. The Read Codes were developed in 1985 by Dr. James Read. The U.K. National Health Service Centre for Coding and Classification (NHS CCC) acquired and now maintains the Read Codes. Read Codes contain hundreds of thousands of terms, synonyms, and abbreviations covering all aspects of patient care including signs and symptoms, treatments and therapies, investigations, occupations, diagnoses, and drugs and appliances. Read Codes are used by healthcare professionals in computerized information systems. Read Codes are now known as Clinical Terms. Clinical Terms Version 3 (CTV3) has been merged with the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine – Reference Terminology (SNOMED RT), resulting in the creation of SNOMED – Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). PLEASE NOTE: the retirement of Read v2 and v3 (CTV3) clinical terminologies has been scheduled. The last release of Read v2 was April 2016, with CTV3 due to be retired after the April 2018 release. Organisations should be well underway with their preparations to ensure they can use the dictionary of medicines and devices (dm+d) for medicines and SNOMED CT for clinical content.

FAIRsharing.tghhc4	Pipeline Patterns Ontology	PP	To answer the need for a workflow representing a sequence of data transformations, a high-level process ontology was defined, denoted Pipeline Patterns (PP) ontology.  Every concept is generically a Data (class from EDAM), which can be further specified as an Entry (P:00002) or an Exit (P:00009). All Entries can be subjected to an Operation (class from EDAM) producing an Intermediate (P:00010). An Intermediate has a TemporalEntity associated to represent its time of creation. Some Entries are specifically of the type Exit, meaning that they will represent concepts that exit the current category and be passed to the next one on the workflow. Additionally, in order to permit the treatment of a set of objects as a single entity, this high-level ontology considers the concept of List (P:00004) and more specifically an Aggregate (P:00005), containing a set of Data or Entry, respectively. The concept Intermediate is an Entry, allowing for the successive application of an operation to an Element. This is particularly useful in the case of the application of sequential set of operations.
FAIRsharing.th72sy	IBP Wheat Plant Anatomy and Development Ontology	CO_121	The IBP Wheat Plant Anatomy and Development Ontology defines growth stages of wheat and is part of the Crop Ontology (CO) project.

FAIRsharing.wf28wm	UniProt Taxonomy	UP Taxonomy	The taxonomy database that is maintained by the UniProt group is based on the NCBI taxonomy database, which is supplemented with data specific to the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB). While the NCBI taxonomy is updated daily to be in sync with GenBank/EMBL-Bank/DDBJ, the UniProt taxonomy is updated only at UniProt releases to be in sync with UniProtKB. It may therefore happen that for the time period of a UniProt release, you can find new taxa at the NCBI that are not yet in UniProt (and vice versa for deleted taxa). Species with manually annotated and reviewed protein sequences in the Swiss-Prot section of UniProtKB are named according to UniProt nomenclature. In particular, we have adopted a systematic convention for naming viral and bacterial strains and isolates.

FAIRsharing.wgfrmg	Crop Ontology	CO	Created in 2008 by the CGIAR, the Crop Ontology (CO; http://www.cropontology.org) is an essential source of traits and variables to support the standardization of the breeding databases such as the Integrated Breeding Platform’s BMS (IBP; https://www.integratedbreeding.net/) and the Boyce Thompson Institute’s Breedbase (https://breedbase.org/) (Arnaud et al., 2020). By providing descriptions of agronomic, morphological, physiological, quality, and stress traits along with their definitions and relationships, also including a standard nomenclature for composing the variables, the CO enables digital capture and aggregation of crop trait data, as well as comparison across projects and locations (Shrestha et al, 2012). The crop ontologies follow a conceptual model that defines a phenotypic variable as a combination of a trait, a method and a scale. This model aims at supporting the creation and management of breeders’ field books and the generation of annotated trial data. Annotated data are interpretable, interoperable and reusable. The development of a crop-specific ontology is a community-driven effort which is usually coordinated by a curator (or curators) nominated from within the community itself. CO’s Traits that are properly described following the guidelines are progressively mapped to the Planteome species-neutral Trait Ontology (TO) maintained by Oregon State University.

The biomedical research community relies on a diverse set of resources, both within their own institutions and at other research centers. Without effective means to locate and query these resources, it is challenging, if not impossible, for investigators to be aware of the myriad resources available, or to effectively perform resource discovery when the need arises.
FAIRsharing.zkdn1d	Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)-IPGRI-Bioversity Multi-Crop Passport Descriptor	CO_020	The FAO/IPGRI Multi-Crop Passport Descriptor is part of the Crop Ontology (CO) project. The ontology has been adapted from the December 2015 version of the FAO/Bioversity Multi-Crop Passport Descriptors. Reference Plant Ontologies are being developed in the context of the Planteome project and are being integrated with the Crop Ontology, which provides harmonized breeders’ trait names, measurement methods, scales and standard variables for many crops. This ontology is one of these reference plant ontologies integrated within the Crop Ontology. This ontology is currently unavailable from the Crop Ontology site, and therefore has been marked as uncertain. Please get in touch with us if you have information on this resource.
FAIRsharing.ZkwSlo	Animal Health Ontology for Livestock	AHOL	The AHOL ontology (Animal Health Ontology for Livestock) was built collaboratively within a network of experts in the livestock health field, in order to describe production diseases. Its structure is based on the type of disease: communicable, non communicable, genetic, metabolic, physical or psychological. The properties of each disease are related to associated symptoms (the expression of a phenotypical character), the affected organism (livestock, poultry, mammals, fishes) or the one causing the disease (virus, bacteria, fungus, parasite).
FAIRsharing.zn05ta	Parkinson's Disease Ontology	PDON	The Parkinson's Disease Ontology (PDO) was created to represent and model the Parkinson's Disease knowledge domain. This ontology with a covers major biomedical concepts from molecular to clinical features of the disease as well as the different views on disease features held by molecular biologists, clinicians and drug developers. This resource has been created for use in the IMI-funded AETIONOMY project (www.aetionomy.org).
FAIRsharing.znrhmd	Heart Failure Ontology	HFO	Heart failure ontology is an attempt to define heart-failure-relevant information including the causes and risk factors, signs and symptoms, diagnostic tests and results, and treatment.
FAIRsharing.zsnv69	Multiple alignment	MAO	MAO is an ontology for multiple alignments of nucleic and protein sequences. MAO is designed to improve interoperation and data sharing between different alignment protocols for the construction of a high quality, reliable multiple alignment in order to facilitate knowledge extraction and the presentation of the most pertinent information to the biologist.
FAIRsharing.zve9cc	Proteasix Ontology	PxO	The Proteasix Ontology (PxO) is an ontology that supports the Proteasix tool; an open-source peptide-centric tool that can be used to predict automatically and in a large-scale fashion in silico the proteases involved in the generation of proteolytic cleavage fragments (peptides). PxO aims to describe the known proteases and their target cleavage sites, to enable the description of proteolytic cleavage fragments as the outputs of observed and predicted proteolysis, and to use knowledge about the function, species and cellular location of a protease and protein substrate to support the prioritisation of proteases in observed and predicted proteolysis. Although the Proteasix project website remains active, download / browse links to the ontology are no longer available and the owners of the resource have not confirmed its current status. Therefore we have marked this resource with an Uncertain status. Please get in touch if you can provide FAIRsharing with up-to-date information regarding this resource.
FAIRsharing.zvytda	International Classification of Primary Care Version 2 PLUS	ICPC-2 PLUS	The International Classification of Primary Care Version 2 PLUS (ICPC-2 PLUS, also known as the BEACH coding system) is a clinical terminology which extends the International Classification of Primary Care, Version 2 (ICPC-2). ICPC-2 PLUS can be used in age-sex disease registers, morbidity registers and full electronic health records in primary care. Primarily used in Australia, ICPC-2 PLUS is used within software packages and electronic health record (EHR) systems. It is also used in research projects, including the BEACH (Bettering the Evaluation And Care of Health) program, the national study of general practice activity. The terminology is therefore often referred to as the BEACH coding system.  ICPC-2 PLUS has been specifically designed by the FMRC for use in computerised clinical systems, recall systems, disease registers and secondary coding of clinical data. It is not part of the ICPC-2 standard. Charges apply for end users of ICPC-2 PLUS. All end users must sign an ICPC-2 PLUS end user contract before being given access to ICPC-2 PLUS. The World Organization of Family Doctors (WONCA) and the WONCA International Classification Committee (WICC) have no control over it although they do have control over the ICPC classification which the PLUS extension makes use of.
FAIRsharing.ZZZvAw	Units in the Virtual Observatory	VOUnits	VOUnits is a recommended syntax for writing the string representation of unit labels. In addition, it describes a set of recognised and deprecated units, which is as far as possible consistent with other relevant standards (BIPM, ISO/IEC and the IAU). The intention is that units written to conform to this specification will likely also be parsable by other well-known parsers. To this end, we include machine-readable grammars for other units syntaxes.
