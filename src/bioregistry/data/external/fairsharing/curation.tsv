FAIRsharing.119q9t		UMLS Semantic Network	The US National Library of Medicine has developed the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), whose goal it is to provide integrated access to a large number of biomedical resources by unifying the vocabularies that are used to access those resources. The UMLS Metathesaurus interrelates more than 150 controlled vocabularies in the biomedical domain. The UMLS coverage is quite extensive, including not only many concepts in clinical medicine, but also a large number of concepts applicable to the broad domain of the life sciences. In order to provide an overarching conceptual framework for all UMLS concepts, the UMLS Semantic Network, an upper-level ontology, has been developed. The Semantic Network provides a consistent categorization of all concepts represented in the UMLS Metathesaurus. The links between the semantic types provide the structure for the network and represent important relationships in the biomedical domain. The Semantic Network consists of (1) a set of broad subject categories, or Semantic Types, that provide a consistent categorization of all concepts represented in the UMLS Metathesaurus, and (2) a set of useful and important relationships, or Semantic Relations, that exist between Semantic Types.

FAIRsharing.2rm2b3	PROV-O	W3C Provenance Ontology	The PROV Ontology (PROV-O) expresses the PROV Data Model using the OWL2 Web Ontology Language (OWL2). It is intended for the Linked Data and Semantic Web community. It provides a set of classes, properties, and restrictions that can be used to represent and interchange provenance information generated in different systems and under different contexts. It can also be specialized to create new classes and properties to model provenance information for different applications and domains. PROV-O is one serialization of PROV-DM, the other two being PROV-N and PROV-XML. PROV-DM and PROV-O define how to represent provenance on the World Wide Web, and as such additional documentation has been included in this record for PROV-AQ (Access and Query), a note which describes how standard web protocols may be used to locate, retrieve and query provenance records. PROV-DC provides a mapping from Dublin Core to PROV-O, and is listed in this record. For the purpose of this specification, provenance is defined as a record that describes the people, institutions, entities, and activities involved in producing, influencing, or delivering a piece of data or a thing. In particular, the provenance of information is crucial in deciding whether information is to be trusted, how it should be integrated with other diverse information sources, and how to give credit to its originators when reusing it. In an open and inclusive environment such as the Web, where users find information that is often contradictory or questionable, provenance can help those users to make trust judgements.
FAIRsharing.2rzyrx	DCO	Dispedia Core Ontology	Dispedia Core Ontology is a schema for information brokering and knowledge management in the complex field of rare diseases. On the one hand, the Dispedia schema uses semantic technologies to describe patients affected by rare diseases, and on the other hand, to record expertise concerning these particular diseases in machine-processable form. In addition to the differentiated attribution of facts to the individual need for information, Dispedia enables information brokering which adjusts to the type of recipient, its character as well as its personal attitude. The schema was initially geared to an exemplified disease, Amyotrophe Lateralsclerose (ALS).
FAIRsharing.2xahkx	NIFDYS	Neuroscience Information Framework Dysfunction	This ontology contains the former BIRNLex-Disease, version 1.3.2. -- The BIRN Project lexicon will provide entities for data and database annotation for the BIRN project, covering anatomy, disease, data collection, project management and experimental design. It is built using the organizational framework provided by the foundational Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It uses an abstract biomedical layer on top of that - OBO-UBO which has been constructed as a proposal to the OBO Foundry. This is meant to support creating a sharable view of core biomedical objects such as biomaterial_entity, and organismal_entity that all biomedical ontologies are likely to need and want to use with the same intended meaning. The BIRNLex was intended to serve as the basis for construction of a formal ontology for the multiscale investigation of neurological disease.
FAIRsharing.2ZShyL		Ethnology vocabulary	"The Ethnology vocabulary is a controlled vocabulary used for indexing the bibliographical records for the now-archived ""Ethnology"" FRANCIS database (1972 - 2015, http://pascal-francis.inist.fr/).

FAIRsharing.30vmv9		BioSignalML Ontology	An ontology for working with biosignals. This ontology defines concepts to describe the storage and exchange of biosignals, regardless of their underlying data format, and provides terms for common biosignal metadata.
FAIRsharing.31venv	DCO-DEBUGIT	DebugIT Core Ontology	The Debugit Core Ontology (dco) covers the complete conceptual space of the domain of interest in the DebugIT project. It focuses on the management of antibiotics resistance within hospitals and infectious diseases to cover the clinical monitoring use cases. The ontology shall provide a semantic reference as logically defined classes in a formal and computer understandable format. It is supposed to formally represent all basic kinds of entities in the domain of interest, together with their invariant and context-independent properties. The ontology is therefore distinct from the representation of clinical knowledge as targeted by the DebugIT WP 4. Instead, it has a supportive semantic glue Function as it provides standardized and formally described meaning identifiers across the whole project, hence serving the Interoperability platform as well.
FAIRsharing.33aa85	ISO 639-3	ISO 639-3 Codes for the representation of names of languages - Part 3: Alpha-3 code for comprehensive coverage of languages	ISO 639-3 provides a comprehensive set of identifiers for all languages for use in a wide range of applications, including linguistics, lexicography and internationalization of information systems. It attempts to represent all known full languages. ISO 639 provides three language code sets: one is a two-letter code (ISO 639-1) and two others are three-letter codes (ISO 639-2 and ISO 639-3) for the representation of names of languages.  The three-letter codes in ISO 639-2 and ISO 639-3 are complementary and compatible. The two codes have been devised for different purposes. The set of individual languages listed in ISO 639-2 is a subset of those listed in ISO 639-3. The codes differ in that ISO 639-2 includes code elements representing some individual languages and also collections of languages, while ISO 639-3 includes code elements for all known individual languages but not for collections of languages. Overall, the set of individual languages listed in ISO 639-3 is much larger than the set of individual languages listed in ISO 639-2.

FAIRsharing.3de58a	OCO	OpenCitations Ontology	The OpenCitations Ontology (OCO) is not yet another bibliographic ontology; instead, it is a place where existing and complementary ontological entities from several other ontologies are grouped to provide descriptive metadata for the OpenCitations Indexes and other OpenCitations datasets. This model is freely available for third parties to use to model their data, either for their independent use or to permit their data, conformed to the OpenCitations Data Model, to be published on their behalf by OpenCitations.
FAIRsharing.3dm6gm	EHDA	Edinburgh Human Developmental Anatomy	A structured controlled vocabulary of stage-specific anatomical structures of the human. It has been designed to mesh with the mouse anatomy (EMAP ontology) and incorporates each Carnegie stage of development (CS1-20). The timed version of the human developmental anatomy ontology gives all the tissues present at each Carnegie Stage (CS) of human development (1-20) linked by a part-of rule. Each term is mentioned only once so that the embryo at each stage can be seen as the simple sum of its parts. Users should note that tissues that are symmetric (e.g. eyes, ears, limbs) are only mentioned once. The EHDA; Hunter et al. 2003 is less complete than later versions: it comprises a set of ontologies, one for each Carnegie stage (CS) (1–20) that only includes basic part_of data. Its structure was derived from the original EMAP ontology, and its content was based partly on this and partly on a limited study of sectioned human material.
FAIRsharing.3fc9zf	openEHR	openEHR Health Record Specification	openEHR is an open standard that uses a novel two-level modelling methodology to represent health information and meta-data by preserving the semantics during when it were created. It enables semantic interoperability and makes it possible to link disparate data sources easily and safely. It also allows for terminology binding which provides the bridge between the 'terminology' and 'information model' this making it much more useful than using these standards separately. Although openEHR is a de-facto standard that is developed by volunteers openly, ISO and CEN adopted it (ISO/EN 13606) so it is a full international standard. It has relationship and mappings between other standards, such as HL7.
FAIRsharing.3ftws4	OGR	Ontology of Geographical Region	This OWL ontology classified the geograhical regions related vocabularies extracted from UMLS. It must be used with other two ontologies, in the case of diabetes: the Ontology of Glucose Metabolism Disorder (OGMD) and the Ontology for Genetic Disease Investigations (OGDI).

FAIRsharing.3fyavr	OBIws	Bioinformatics Web Service Ontology	The Bioinformatics Web Services ontology (OBIws) is an ontology that extends the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) to build an ontology that supports consistent annotation of bioinformatics Web services. We follow a systematic methodology for enriching OBI with terms to support Web service annotation. This process involves the design of ontology analysis diagrams for Web services and their subsequent analysis to discover terms that need to be added to the ontology. Current OBIws ontology is focusing on sequence analysis web services. With developed patterns of modeling web services, OBIws can be extended easily to support annotations of different kind web services.

FAIRsharing.446bv0	OoEVV	Ontology of Experimental Variables and Values	The Ontology of Experimental Variables and Values (OoEVV) provides a lightweight representation of (a) the variables used to measure experimental properties and (b) the measurement scales that form the complex data types supporting that data. Many different variables measure the same thing, here we use a lightweight representation driven by a small number of classes and a large number of variables to focus only on providing a vocabulary of variables that may be extended for consolidation to standardized variables for specific things and functions to map between values from different measurements scales. We use the base ontology description to provide a very lightweight representation of the basic elements of an experimental design and we use views to instantiate it for specific domains.
FAIRsharing.46rwe6	CSSO	Clinical Signs and Symptoms Ontology	An ontology for describing clinical signs and symptoms.
FAIRsharing.495736	ISO 639-1:2002	ISO 639-1:2002 Codes for the representation of names of languages — Part 1: Alpha-2 code	This part of ISO 639 provides a code consisting of language code elements comprising two-letter language identifiers for the representation of names of languages. The language identifiers according to this part of ISO 639 were devised originally for use in terminology, lexicography and linguistics, but may be adopted for any application requiring the expression of language in two-letter coded form, especially in computerized systems. Languages designed exclusively for machine use, such as computer-programming languages, are not included in this code.
FAIRsharing.49bmk	anaeeThes	AnaEE Thesaurus	The anaeeThes thesaurus aims at providing a controlled vocabulary for the semantic description of the study of continental ecosystems and their biodiversity. The thesaurus consists of concepts handled in different main thematic areas: abiotic (e.g. atmosphere, climate, hydrosphere, litosphere); biotic (e.g. animals, plants, micro-organisms, biodiversity); chemical compounds; experimentation and observation (e.g. instrument, method, protocol, measurement, quality, infrastructure); ecosystems (e.g. type, structure, functioning); modeling (e.g. formalism, platform, type of model, computer language); disciplines (disciplinary and scientific fields); and unit (units of the international system, inherited from the OBOE-standards ontology).

FAIRsharing.4e6af5	UKAT	UK Archival Thesaurus	UK Archival Thesaurus (UKAT) is a subject thesaurus created for the archive sector in the United Kingdom. It is a controlled vocabulary that archives can use when indexing their collections and catalogues. It is intended to improve access to archives by subject, ensure that users of archives can carry out effective subject searches of archives across the UK, and promote the involvement in archives by groups which are under-represented among archive users by providing subject terms which reflect their histories and experiences. UKAT is based on the structure of the UNESCO Thesaurus, and covers education, science, culture, social/human sciences, information, communication, politics, law and economics. UNESCO was used as the basis for UKAT because a number of archives and archive projects, including The Archives Hub, had adopted it for indexing purposes. However, UNESCO sometimes lacks the depth of detailed terminology required by UK archives. UKAT therefore incorporates terms that UK repositories and projects have contributed, or have been sourced from other schemes such as Library of Congress Subject Headings and the British Education Thesaurus. Particular emphasis has been given to incorporating terms reflecting the histories and experiences of groups that are under-represented among archive users. This aims to encourage participation in archival heritage, in line with national priorities for the sector.

FAIRsharing.4ghkfj	LCGFT	Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms for Library and Archival Materials	"The Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms for Library and Archival Materials (LCGFT) is a thesaurus that describes what a work is versus what it is about. For instance, the subject heading Horror films, with appropriate subdivisions, would be assigned to a book about horror films. A cataloger assigning headings to the movie The Texas Chainsaw Massacre would also use Horror films, but it would be a genre/form term since the movie is a horror film, not a movie about horror films. The thesaurus combines both genres and forms. Form is defined as a characteristic of works with a particular format and/or purpose. A ""short"" is a particular form, for example, as is ""animation."" Genre refers to categories of works that are characterized by similar plots, themes, settings, situations, and characters."

Its scope has now expanded to cover the collections held by the UK Data Service.
FAIRsharing.69734m	MERA	Medical Educational Resource Aggregator	The educational resource ontology is designed in order to provide structure to resources aggregated by the educational resource aggregator. The aim of the educational resource aggregator is to harvest educational resources from 3rd party repositories, present these to the medical expert for annotation and rating, and output the results of the annotation (together with resource metadata) to the CARRE public RDF repository. The main parts of this aggregator are: the Resource Retriever, the Resource Rating, the Resource Metadata Processing, and the User Application. The educational metadata involve the Resource Metadata processing module.This module is a combination of 3 services that collect data per article, making multiple SPARQL requests to enrich the data and finally store it as a unique identified resource into the local datastore. Then data is transformed into RDF triples in order to be inserted to CARRE educational repository. The ontology is developed using the Protégé v5.0 , a free, open-source ontology editor from the Stanford University. The ontology is available on CARRE rdf repository among the other ontologies. CARRE url : http://carre.kmi.open.ac.uk/ontology/educational.owl

FAIRsharing.6gs502	STUFF	Stuff Ontology	Multiple domain ontologies have various representations of types of stuff--also called matter, mass, or substance--such as milk, alcohol, and mud. This is modelled in a range of different ways that are not quite compatible with each other as they do not adhere to a single structured approach, at times not even within an ontology itself. The Stuff Ontology is a 'bridging' core ontology describing categories of stuff and formalised in OWL for purposes of implementability. It stands on its own, but there are also versions that link to the DOLCE and BFO foundational ontologies, and one with examples to illustrate classification of stuffs (among others, mayonnaise and gold). This then also resolves the main type of interoperability issues with stuffs in domain ontologies, thereby also contributing to better ontology quality.
FAIRsharing.6mck	CHEAR	Children's Health Exposure Analysis Resource	Children's health and wellbeing are influenced by interactions between environmental and genetic factors. NIEHS is establishing an infrastructure, the Children's Health Exposure Analysis Resource (CHEAR), to provide the extramural research community access to laboratory and data analyses that add or expand the inclusion of environmental exposures in children's health research. The goal of CHEAR is to provide tools so researchers can assess the full range of environmental exposures which may affect children's health. We anticipate that CHEAR will be used by children's health researchers conducting epidemiological or clinical studies that currently have limited consideration of environmental exposures, or those who have collected exposure data but seek more extensive analyses.
FAIRsharing.6mmbzs	PLIO	Protein-ligand interaction ontology	The protein--ligand interaction ontology (PLIO) was developed around three main concepts, namely target, ligand and interaction, and was enriched by adding synonyms, useful annotations and references. PLIO represents knowledge about the interaction of proteins and ligands (including drugs) and has a different scope and conceptual resolution than, for example, the molecular interaction ontology. An important feature of PLIO is that it links directly from an ontology framework describing protein–ligand interactions to the mathematical formulas relevant for the computation of some of the entities represented in the ontology.

FAIRsharing.8337e2	GND	Integrated Authority File	The Integrated Authority File (GND) is a service facilitating the collaborative use and administration of authority data. These authority data represent and describe entities, i.e. persons, corporate bodies, conferences and events, geographic entities, topics and works relating to cultural and academic collections. Libraries in particular use the GND to catalogue publications. However, archives, museums, cultural and academic institutions, and researchers involved in research projects are also increasingly working with the GND. Authority data make cataloguing easier, offer definitive search entries and forge links between different information resources. Every entity in the GND features a unique and stable identifier (GND ID). This makes it possible to link the authority data with both each other and external data sets and web resources. This results in a cross-organisational, machine-readable data network.

The overall scope of the CIDOC CRM can be summarised in simple terms as the curated, factual knowledge
about the past at a human scale. The CIDOC CRM is intended to promote a shared understanding of cultural heritage information by providing a common and extensible semantic framework that any cultural heritage information can be mapped to. It is intended to be a common language for domain experts and implementers to formulate requirements for information systems and to serve as a guide for good practice of conceptual modelling. In this way, it can provide the ""semantic glue"" needed to mediate between different sources of cultural heritage information, such as that published by museums, libraries and archives. The ISO 21127:2014 specification (Information and documentation — A reference ontology for the interchange of cultural heritage information) was created from the CIDOC CRM, although the CIDOC CRM Special Interest Group continues to maintain this original document as well."

The previous version dates from 19 September 2018.
FAIRsharing.ae8hpt	DOLCE	Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering	DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering) is a foundational ontology developed as part of the WonderWeb Foundational Ontologies Library (WFOL).  The development of this library has been guided by the need of a reliable set of foundational ontologies that can serve as 1) astarting point for building other ontologies, 2) a reference point for easy and rigorous comparisons among different ontological approaches, and 3) a rigorous basis for analyzing, harmonizing and integrating existing ontologies and metadata standards (by manually mapping them into some general module(s) in the library). DOLCE is the first module of WFOL and it is not a candidate for a universal standard ontology. Rather, it is intended as a starting point for comparing and elucidating the relationships with the other modules of the library, and also for clarifying the hidden assumptions underlying existing ontologies or linguistic resources such as WordNet.  As reflected by its acronym, DOLCE has a clear cognitive bias, in the sense that it aims at capturing the ontological categories underlying natural language and human commonsense. DOLCE is an ontology that focuses on particulars in the sense that its domain of discourse is restricted to them. The project is complete, though the ontology remains available for use.
FAIRsharing.aef0q5	CogAt	Cognitive Atlas	"The Cognitive Atlas is a collaborative knowledge building project that aims to develop a knowledge base (or ontology) that characterizes the state of current thought in cognitive science. Cognitive neuroscience aims to map mental processes onto brain function, which begs the question of what ""mental processes"" exist and how they relate to the tasks that are used to manipulate and measure them."

FAIRsharing.an9ct0	DIAB	BioMedBridges Diabetes Ontology	"The BioMedBridges diabetes-specific ontology enables users to integrate data resources related to prediabetes, diabetes, and late consequences/complications of diabetes. Data integration between mouse disease models and human studies is hindered by fundamental differences in the ontologies used by the respective communities to describe the same phenotypes. Common standards and ontologies to bridge the phenotype gap between mouse and human open extensive mouse phenotype data to clinical researchers. 

To develop a comprehensive set of terms to describe Type 2 diabetes and obesity phenotypes in mouse and human, Type 2 Diabetes-related phenotypes were mined from the literature for use as new phenotype terms. Expert clinicians/diabetologists then curated the mined terms and categorised them by temporal disease stages. The ontology was then used for the annotation of mouse and human datasets with specific terminology representing Type 2 Diabetes progression, which will ultimately support translational research."

The list includes the units recommended for each standard name (most common prefixes can be used with the units, e.g. kilo (k), hecto (h), Mega (M), etc). If a standard_name metadata attribute is associated with a data variable, its value must be chosen from the list published in the standard name table. It is not compulsory within the CF conventions to assign a standard name to a data variable, but including one helps data users to understand the contents of a netCDF file. A CF standard name is not a netCDF variable name, but instead a value for the standard_name variable attribute. A standard_name attribute identifies the physical quantity of a variable.
FAIRsharing.faej7j	PHMAMMADO	Phallusia mammillata Anatomy and Development Ontology	The first ontology describing the anatomy and the development of Phallusia mammillata.

FAIRsharing.farr39	BAO-GPCR	G Protein-Coupled Receptor BioAssays Ontology	The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) ontology (http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao_gpcr) describes pharmacology, biochemistry and physiology of these important and therapeutically promising class of academic and pharmaceutical research targets. Incorporation and comparison of various small molecule screening data sets, such as those deposited in PubChem, ChEMBL, KEGG, PDSP, and/or IUPHAR databases, requires a formalized electronic organization system. In order to bridge the gap between the overflow of HTS data and the bottleneck of integrated analysis tools, herein, we provide the first comprehensive GPCR ontology. The development and utility of GPCR ontology was based on previously developed BioAssay Ontology (BAO). The GPCR ontology contains information about biochemical, pharmacological, and functional properties of individual GPCRs as well as GPCR-selective ligands inclusive of their HTS screening results and other records. This provides the first all-inclusive GPCR ontology with all available data to model the relationship between the GPCR binding sites and their physiologic and pharmacologic role in physiology via small molecule chemical structures. We developed this system using emerging semantic technologies, by leveraging existing and descriptive domain level ontologies.

FAIRsharing.fr3ng0	EHDAA	Edinburgh Human Developmental Anatomy Abstract	"A structured controlled vocabulary of stage-specific anatomical structures of the human. It has been designed to mesh with the mouse anatomy (EMAP ontology) and incorporates each Carnegie stage of development (CS1-20). This abstract version of the human developmental anatomy ontology compresses all the tissues present over Carnegie stages 1-20 into a single hierarchy. The heart, for example, is present from Carnegie Stage 9 onwards and is thus represented by 12 EHDA IDs (one for each stage). In the abstract mouse, it has a single ID so that the abstract term given as just heart really means heart (CS 9-20). This ontology was made computationally and later deemed ""incoherent"" by the authors because the stage-dependent hierarchical structures were not integrated."

This ontology is created with the mindset of categorizing fish automatically based on the attributes and terms mined from the fish specimen. Most of the basic organization from this ontology follows Nelson's research due to its synthetic and broad approach, while recognizing that Nelson's conclusions are one of many alternative interpretations of the literature, which is mostly agreed by our main references, and many fish and fisheries researchers. Most of the classification used in this ontology is in no means completed and just following the recent classification provided by the books For now our work focused more on two group of fish which is early jawless fish, and advanced jawed fishes. The classification from both of this group are structured following the reference."

The goal is to create an ontology that will allow data integration and reasoning with subject data to classify subjects, and based on this classification, to infer new knowledge on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). They extended an existing autism ontology to allow automatic inference of ASD phenotypes and Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria based on subjects’ Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) assessment data.
FAIRsharing.j2np9m	TOP-MENELAS	Menelas Project Top-Level Ontology	The two main goals MENELAS contributes to are to (i) Provide better account of and better access to medical information through natural languages in order to help physicians in their daily practice, and to (ii) Enhance European cooperation by multilingual access to standardised medical nomenclatures. The major achievements of MENELAS are the realisation of its two functional systems: (i) The Document Indexing System encodes free text PDSs into both an internal representation (a set of Conceptual Graphs) and international nomenclature codes (ICD-9-CM). Instances of the Document Indexing System have been realised for French, English and Dutch ; (ii) The Consultation System allows users to access the information contained in PDSs previously indexed by the Document Indexing System. The test domain for the project was coronary diseases. The existing prototype shows promising results for information retrieval from natural language PDSs and for automatically encoding PDSs into an existing classification such as ICD-9-CM. A set of components, tools, knowledge bases and methods has also been produced by the project. These include language-independent ontology and models for the domain of coronary diseases; conceptual description of the relevant ICD-9-CM codes. This ontology includes a top-ontology, a top-domain ontology and a domain ontology (Coronay diseases surgery). The menelas-top ontology here is the part of the whole ontology without any reference to medical domain.

FAIRsharing.jT49Da		Provenance Vocabulary	The Provenance Vocabulary provides classes and properties for describing provenance of Web data. The vocabulary focuses on two main use cases: 1.) It enables consumers of Web data to describe provenance of data retrieved from the Web and of data derived from such Web data. 2.) It enables providers of Web data to publish provenance-related metadata about their data. Notice, the vocabulary is not intended for describing provenance of other kinds of Web content. The Provenance Vocabulary is designed as a Web data specific specialization of the W3C PROV Ontology (PROV-O); classes and properties provided by the vocabulary are domain specific extensions of the more general concepts introduced in PROV-O. As a consequence, any Provenance Vocabulary based description of provenance can be easily interpreted and exchanged according to the W3C PROV family of standards. While this vocabulary is in a stable state, it is not being actively developed at this time.

FAIRsharing.lWbenx	RefMet	Reference list of Metabolite names	"RefMet provides a standardized reference nomenclature for both discrete metabolite structures and metabolite species identified by spectroscopic techniques in metabolomics experiments. This is an essential prerequisite for the ability to compare and contrast metabolite data across different experiments and studies. Over 200,000 names from a set of over 1,100 MS and NMR studies on the Metabolomics Workbench has been used to generate a highly curated analytical chemistry-centric list of common names for metabolite structures and isobaric species. Additionally, the vast majority of these names have been linked to a metabolite classification system using a combination of LIPID MAPS and ClassyFire classification methods. A name-conversion user interface is provided where users can submit a list of metabolite names and map them to the corresponding RefMet names. New metabolites are constantly being added to RefMet, however very new metabolite names generated by metabolomics experiments may not currently map to RefMet identifiers. Nevertheless, RefMet has the ability to greatly increase the data-sharing potential of metabolomics experiments and facilitate ""meta-analysis"" and systems biology objectives for the majority of commonly encountered metabolite species."
FAIRsharing.m0e1s0	SOY	SoyOntology	This is a community-curated controlled vocabulary for soybean field growth stages (Soybean Whole Plant Growth Ontology), plant structure names (Soybean Structure Ontology), development (Soybean Development Ontology) and plant traits (Soybean Trait Ontology).

FAIRsharing.mp8js2	MWLA	Medical Web Lifestyle Aggregator	This ontology designed and developed in order to represent the detected intentions from the Web Lifestyle Data Aggregator. In particular, it seeks to represent what is involved in the gathering of data from the web and social lifestyle of user on the Internet. We decided, therefore, to develop the ontology using the Protégé v5.0, a free, open-source ontology editor from the Stanford University. The outcome of Protégé is available on the following URL: http://carre.kmi.open.ac.uk/ontology/lifestyle.owl The presented ontology is generic and can support different type of providers (e.g. web searches, Facebook, Twitter etc.). Additionally, the predefined intentions are also generic supporting the majority of intentions in the Web. In the context of CARRE, we utilize, as a first attempt, the web searches as provider and we only upload the relevant intentions (health and travel) to CARRE in the private RDF repository. A user (representing an individual person whose data is being represented using the terms of this ontology) has connections. A connection represents that a Web Lifestyle Data Aggregator of a particular personal computer of user provides intentions for particulars providers. A connection is therefore associated with a UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) that represents an installation of the aggregator. A provider can be the web searches, Facebook or Twitter. A measurement is associated with a provider and a connection in order to declare the connection (i.e. the Web Lifestyle Data Aggregator of a particular personal computer) from which a measurement came. Every measurement must have a date at which the detected intention was taken, a weight which defines the importance of an intention and of course the detected intention that is only relevant to CARRE.

FAIRsharing.sxh2dp	PSI-MS	HUPO PSI Mass Spectrometry Controlled Vocabulary	The PSI-MS Controlled Vocabulary is developed in common with the PSI-Proteomics Informatics group. It consists of a large collection of structured terms covering description and use of Mass Spectrometry instrumentation as well as Protein Identification and Quantitation software. The source of the terms are multiple: they include vocabulary and definitions in chapter 12 of the IUPAC nomenclature book, instrument and software vendors and developers and other user-submitted terms. Although its structure and use is linked to mzML, mzIdentML and mzQuantML, it is dynamically maintained in a OBO format. The PSI-Mass Spectrometry (MS) CV contains all the terms used in the PSI MS–related data standards. The CV contains a logical hierarchical structure to ensure ease of maintenance and the development of software that makes use of complex semantics. The CV contains terms required for a complete description of an MS analysis pipeline used in proteomics, including sample labeling, digestion enzymes, instrumentation parts and parameters, software used for identification and quantification of peptides/proteins and the parameters and scores used to determine their significance. Owing to the range of topics covered by the CV, collaborative development across several PSI working groups, including proteomics research groups, instrument manufacturers and software vendors, was necessary.

FAIRsharing.t955dp	CTV3	Read Codes Clinical Terms Version 3	Read Codes are a coded thesaurus of clinical terms. They have been used in the NHS since 1985. There are two versions: version 2 (v2) and version 3 (CTV3 or v3). Both versions provide a standard vocabulary for clinicians to record patient findings and procedures, in health and social care IT systems across primary and secondary care. The Read Codes were developed in 1985 by Dr. James Read. The U.K. National Health Service Centre for Coding and Classification (NHS CCC) acquired and now maintains the Read Codes. Read Codes contain hundreds of thousands of terms, synonyms, and abbreviations covering all aspects of patient care including signs and symptoms, treatments and therapies, investigations, occupations, diagnoses, and drugs and appliances. Read Codes are used by healthcare professionals in computerized information systems. Read Codes are now known as Clinical Terms. Clinical Terms Version 3 (CTV3) has been merged with the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine – Reference Terminology (SNOMED RT), resulting in the creation of SNOMED – Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). PLEASE NOTE: the retirement of Read v2 and v3 (CTV3) clinical terminologies has been scheduled. The last release of Read v2 was April 2016, with CTV3 due to be retired after the April 2018 release. Organisations should be well underway with their preparations to ensure they can use the dictionary of medicines and devices (dm+d) for medicines and SNOMED CT for clinical content. SNOMED CT is adopted across primary care and the wider NHS.

FAIRsharing.tghhc4	PP	Pipeline Patterns Ontology	To answer the need for a workflow representing a sequence of data transformations, a high-level process ontology was defined, denoted Pipeline Patterns (PP) ontology.  Every concept is generically a Data (class from EDAM), which can be further specified as an Entry (P:00002) or an Exit (P:00009). All Entries can be subjected to an Operation (class from EDAM) producing an Intermediate (P:00010). An Intermediate has a TemporalEntity associated to represent its time of creation. Some Entries are specifically of the type Exit, meaning that they will represent concepts that exit the current category and be passed to the next one on the workflow. Additionally, in order to permit the treatment of a set of objects as a single entity, this high-level ontology considers the concept of List (P:00004) and more specifically an Aggregate (P:00005), containing a set of Data or Entry, respectively. The concept Intermediate is an Entry, allowing for the successive application of an operation to an Element. This is particularly useful in the case of the application of sequential set of operations.
FAIRsharing.th72sy	CO_121	IBP Wheat Plant Anatomy and Development Ontology	The IBP Wheat Plant Anatomy and Development Ontology defines growth stages of wheat and is part of the Crop Ontology (CO) project. The Crop Ontology has been created to compile validated concepts along with their inter-relationships on anatomy, structure and phenotype of Crops, on trait measurement and methods as well as on Germplasm with the multi-crop passport terms. The concepts of the CO are being used to curate agronomic databases and describe the data. The use of ontology terms to describe agronomic phenotypes and the accurate mapping of these descriptions into databases is important in comparative phenotypic and genotypic studies across species and gene-discovery experiments as it provides harmonized description of the data and therefore facilitates the retrieval of information. Although this ontology seems to have a stable status on its homepage, it is listed as Retired in AgroPortal. Therefore we have marked its record status as Uncertain. Please get in touch if you have information regarding the current status of this resource.

FAIRsharing.ts6zgq	NCCNEHR	NCCN EHR Oncology Categories	The NCCN EHR Oncology Advisory Group was formed to address the high variance in oncology history documentation within EHR systems. Specifically, there is a lack of standardization in the names of oncology history categories across institutions. Moreover, no synonym list or mapping currently exists between the varied category names. Furthermore, oncology history documentation is often inconsistent, incomplete, and not updated appropriately. The NCCN EHR Oncology Advisory Group has established best practices and is working with EHR vendors to implement and enhance tools for documentation of oncology history. This ontology is a result of the work of the group, and provides users with a list of oncology history categories and synonyms. It is our sincere hope that this work can form the basis of improving standardization and interoperability of oncology history documentation within EHR systems.

FAIRsharing.wgfrmg	CO	Crop Ontology	Created in 2008 by the CGIAR, the Crop Ontology (CO; http://www.cropontology.org) is an essential source of traits and variables to support the standardization of the breeding databases such as the Integrated Breeding Platform’s BMS (IBP; https://www.integratedbreeding.net/) and the Boyce Thompson Institute’s Breedbase (https://breedbase.org/) (Arnaud et al., 2020). By providing descriptions of agronomic, morphological, physiological, quality, and stress traits along with their definitions and relationships, also including a standard nomenclature for composing the variables, the CO enables digital capture and aggregation of crop trait data, as well as comparison across projects and locations (Shrestha et al, 2012). The crop ontologies follow a conceptual model that defines a phenotypic variable as a combination of a trait, a method and a scale. This model aims at supporting the creation and management of breeders’ field books and the generation of annotated trial data. Annotated data are interpretable, interoperable and reusable. The development of a crop-specific ontology is a community-driven effort which is usually coordinated by a curator (or curators) nominated from within the community itself. CO’s Traits that are properly described following the guidelines are progressively mapped to the Planteome species-neutral Trait Ontology (TO) maintained by Oregon State University.

FAIRsharing.yc237s	MS2O	Multi-Scale Multi-Step Ontology	The Multi-scale Multi-step ontology (MS2O) is an ontology to describe transformation processes. MS2O was created for an interdisciplinary project concerning transformation processes in food science. The use case concerns the production of stabilized micro-organisms performed at INRA (French National Institute for Agricultural Research). Experimental observations are available for some inputs of the production processes, at different steps and at a certain scale.
FAIRsharing.ydnwd9	OntoDT	Ontology of General Purpose Datatypes	This ontology contains entities such as: datatype, datatype generator, datatype quality and others giving the possibility to represent arbitrary complex datatypes. This is an important fact for a general data mining ontology that wants to represent and query over modeling algorithms for mining structured data. The ontology was first developed under the OntoDM (Ontology of Data Mining is available at http://kt.ijs.si/panovp/OntoDM) ontology, but for generality and reuse purpose it was decided to export it as a separate ontology. Additionally, the OntoDT ontology is based on and ISO/IEC 11404 (http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=39479) standard and can be reused used independently by any domain ontology that requires representation and reasoning about general purpose datatypes.

FAIRsharing.ypfgeq	TMO	Translational Medicine Ontology	This project focuses on the development of a high level patient-centric ontology for the pharmaceutical industry. The ontology should enable silos in discovery research, hypothesis management, experimental studies, compounds, formulation, drug development, market size, competitive data, population data, etc. to be brought together. This would enable scientists to answer new questions, and to answer existing scientific questions more quickly. This will help pharmaceutical companies to model patient-centric information, which is essential for the tailoring of drugs, and for early detection of compounds that may have sub-optimal safety profiles. The ontology should link to existing publicly available domain ontologies.

FAIRsharing.zc2tfa	IFAR	Fanconi Anemia Ontology	An application ontology devoted to the standardized recording of data related to Fanconi Anemia (FA). This ontology was created using an OWL file provided by Dr. Ada Hamish (and Francois Schiettecatte) at the Centers for Mendelian Genetics, with their permission. Their original ontology can be found at: http://phenodb.net/help/features. Modifications were made using HPO, OMIM, NCI, and SNOMED. Novel classes pertaining to FA were added and defined as appropriate.
FAIRsharing.zcfp65	BRO	Biomedical Resource Ontology	Biomedical Resource Ontology (BRO) enables semantic annotation and discovery of biomedical resources. The biomedical research community relies on a diverse set of resources, both within their own institutions and at other research centers. Without effective means to locate and query these resources, it is challenging, if not impossible, for investigators to be aware of the myriad resources available, or to effectively perform resource discovery when the need arises.
FAIRsharing.zkdn1d	CO_020	Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)-IPGRI-Bioversity Multi-Crop Passport Descriptor	The FAO/IPGRI Multi-Crop Passport Descriptor is part of the Crop Ontology (CO) project. The ontology has been adapted from the December 2015 version of the FAO/Bioversity Multi-Crop Passport Descriptors. Reference Plant Ontologies are being developed in the context of the Planteome project and are being integrated with the Crop Ontology, which provides harmonized breeders’ trait names, measurement methods, scales and standard variables for many crops. This ontology is one of these reference plant ontologies integrated within the Crop Ontology. This ontology is currently unavailable from the Crop Ontology site, and therefore has been marked as uncertain. Please get in touch with us if you have information on this resource.
FAIRsharing.ZkwSlo	AHOL	Animal Health Ontology for Livestock	The AHOL ontology (Animal Health Ontology for Livestock) was built collaboratively within a network of experts in the livestock health field, in order to describe production diseases. Its structure is based on the type of disease: communicable, non communicable, genetic, metabolic, physical or psychological. The properties of each disease are related to associated symptoms (the expression of a phenotypical character), the affected organism (livestock, poultry, mammals, fishes) or the one causing the disease (virus, bacteria, fungus, parasite).
FAIRsharing.zn05ta	PDON	Parkinson's Disease Ontology	The Parkinson's Disease Ontology (PDO) was created to represent and model the Parkinson's Disease knowledge domain. This ontology with a covers major biomedical concepts from molecular to clinical features of the disease as well as the different views on disease features held by molecular biologists, clinicians and drug developers. This resource has been created for use in the IMI-funded AETIONOMY project (www.aetionomy.org).
FAIRsharing.znrhmd	HFO	Heart Failure Ontology	Heart failure ontology is an attempt to define heart-failure-relevant information including the causes and risk factors, signs and symptoms, diagnostic tests and results, and treatment.
FAIRsharing.zsnv69	MAO	Multiple alignment	MAO is an ontology for multiple alignments of nucleic and protein sequences. MAO is designed to improve interoperation and data sharing between different alignment protocols for the construction of a high quality, reliable multiple alignment in order to facilitate knowledge extraction and the presentation of the most pertinent information to the biologist.
FAIRsharing.zve9cc	PxO	Proteasix Ontology	The Proteasix Ontology (PxO) is an ontology that supports the Proteasix tool; an open-source peptide-centric tool that can be used to predict automatically and in a large-scale fashion in silico the proteases involved in the generation of proteolytic cleavage fragments (peptides). PxO aims to describe the known proteases and their target cleavage sites, to enable the description of proteolytic cleavage fragments as the outputs of observed and predicted proteolysis, and to use knowledge about the function, species and cellular location of a protease and protein substrate to support the prioritisation of proteases in observed and predicted proteolysis. Although the Proteasix project website remains active, download / browse links to the ontology are no longer available and the owners of the resource have not confirmed its current status. Therefore we have marked this resource with an Uncertain status. Please get in touch if you can provide FAIRsharing with up-to-date information regarding this resource.
FAIRsharing.zvytda	ICPC-2 PLUS	International Classification of Primary Care Version 2 PLUS	The International Classification of Primary Care Version 2 PLUS (ICPC-2 PLUS, also known as the BEACH coding system) is a clinical terminology which extends the International Classification of Primary Care, Version 2 (ICPC-2). ICPC-2 PLUS can be used in age-sex disease registers, morbidity registers and full electronic health records in primary care. Primarily used in Australia, ICPC-2 PLUS is used within software packages and electronic health record (EHR) systems. It is also used in research projects, including the BEACH (Bettering the Evaluation And Care of Health) program, the national study of general practice activity. The terminology is therefore often referred to as the BEACH coding system.  ICPC-2 PLUS has been specifically designed by the FMRC for use in computerised clinical systems, recall systems, disease registers and secondary coding of clinical data. It is not part of the ICPC-2 standard. Charges apply for end users of ICPC-2 PLUS. All end users must sign an ICPC-2 PLUS end user contract before being given access to ICPC-2 PLUS. The World Organization of Family Doctors (WONCA) and the WONCA International Classification Committee (WICC) have no control over it although they do have control over the ICPC classification which the PLUS extension makes use of.
FAIRsharing.ZZZvAw	VOUnits	Units in the Virtual Observatory	VOUnits is a recommended syntax for writing the string representation of unit labels. In addition, it describes a set of recognised and deprecated units, which is as far as possible consistent with other relevant standards (BIPM, ISO/IEC and the IAU). The intention is that units written to conform to this specification will likely also be parsable by other well-known parsers. To this end, we include machine-readable grammars for other units syntaxes.
