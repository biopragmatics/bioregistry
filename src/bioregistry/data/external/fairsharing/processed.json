Use of this namespace was initiated in 2016 and then strengthened in 2018 with multiple Australian government agencies signing a Memorandum of Understanding to reserve the use of linked.data.gov.au for PID IRIs and to ensure its operational stability. The AGLDWG has adopted the IS0 19135 for IRI registration procedure and roles and issued Guidelines that details its PID allocation process.",

Specifically, while other parties might be used to help enable the discovery of information related to a DID, the design enables the controller of a DID to prove control over it without requiring permission from any other party.

It provides a set of classes, properties, and restrictions that can be used to represent and interchange provenance information generated in different systems and under different contexts. It can also be specialized to create new classes and properties to model provenance information for different applications and domains. PROV-O is one serialization of PROV-DM, the other two being PROV-N and PROV-XML. PROV-DM and PROV-O define how to represent provenance on the World Wide Web, and as such additional documentation has been included in this record for PROV-AQ (Access and Query), a note which describes how standard web protocols may be used to locate, retrieve and query provenance records. PROV-DC provides a mapping from Dublin Core to PROV-O, and is listed in this record. For the purpose of this specification, provenance is defined as a record that describes the people, institutions, entities, and activities involved in producing, influencing, or delivering a piece of data or a thing. In particular, the provenance of information is crucial in deciding whether information is to be trusted, how it should be integrated with other diverse information sources, and how to give credit to its originators when reusing it. In an open and inclusive environment such as the Web, where users find information that is often contradictory or questionable, provenance can help those users to make trust judgements.",

This is meant to support creating a sharable view of core biomedical objects such as biomaterial_entity, and organismal_entity that all biomedical ontologies are likely to need and want to use with the same intended meaning. The BIRNLex was intended to serve as the basis for construction of a formal ontology for the multiscale investigation of neurological disease.",

The EHDA; Hunter et al. 2003 is less complete than later versions: it comprises a set of ontologies, one for each Carnegie stage (CS) (1–20) that only includes basic part_of data. Its structure was derived from the original EMAP ontology, and its content was based partly on this and partly on a limited study of sectioned human material.",

A URL is simply an address of a resource on the World Wide Web. A Persistent URL is an address on the World Wide Web that causes a redirection to another Web resource. If a Web resource changes location (and hence URL), a PURL pointing to it can be updated. A user of a PURL always uses the same Web address, even though the resource in question may have moved. PURLs may be used by publishers to manage their own information space or by Web users to manage theirs; a PURL service is independent of the publisher of information.

It is intended to improve access to archives by subject, ensure that users of archives can carry out effective subject searches of archives across the UK, and promote the involvement in archives by groups which are under-represented among archive users by providing subject terms which reflect their histories and experiences. UKAT is based on the structure of the UNESCO Thesaurus, and covers education, science, culture, social/human sciences, information, communication, politics, law and economics. UNESCO was used as the basis for UKAT because a number of archives and archive projects, including The Archives Hub, had adopted it for indexing purposes. However, UNESCO sometimes lacks the depth of detailed terminology required by UK archives. UKAT therefore incorporates terms that UK repositories and projects have contributed, or have been sourced from other schemes such as Library of Congress Subject Headings and the British Education Thesaurus. Particular emphasis has been given to incorporating terms reflecting the histories and experiences of groups that are under-represented among archive users. This aims to encourage participation in archival heritage, in line with national priorities for the sector.",

The Stuff Ontology is a 'bridging' core ontology describing categories of stuff and formalised in OWL for purposes of implementability. It stands on its own, but there are also versions that link to the DOLCE and BFO foundational ontologies, and one with examples to illustrate classification of stuffs (among others, mayonnaise and gold).

The CIDOC CRM is intended to promote a shared understanding of cultural heritage information by providing a common and extensible semantic framework that any cultural heritage information can be mapped to. It is intended to be a common language for domain experts and implementers to formulate requirements for information systems and to serve as a guide for good practice of conceptual modelling. In this way, it can provide the \"semantic glue\" needed to mediate between different sources of cultural heritage information, such as that published by museums, libraries and archives. The ISO 21127:2014 specification (Information and documentation — A reference ontology for the interchange of cultural heritage information) was created from the CIDOC CRM, although the CIDOC CRM Special Interest Group continues to maintain this original document as well.",

These identifiers are used in the world wide web to redirect users and systems to images, websites and metadata of the physical objects and to integrate them with the semantic web. The CETAF identifier system is based on HTTP-URIs and Linked Data principles. It is simple and future-proof. Each collection object as well as its associated information resources (e.g. multimedia, RDF, webpages) are identified by stable HTTP-URIs that will never change. The URI Syntax for the objects is chosen and maintained by the institution owning them. This flexibility is one of the main advantages of the CETAF Stable Identifier system as it allows e.g. to include branding and local scope identifiers into the CETAF Stable Identifier URI.",

DOLCE is the first module of WFOL and it is not a candidate for a universal standard ontology. Rather, it is intended as a starting point for comparing and elucidating the relationships with the other modules of the library, and also for clarifying the hidden assumptions underlying existing ontologies or linguistic resources such as WordNet.  As reflected by its acronym, DOLCE has a clear cognitive bias, in the sense that it aims at capturing the ontological categories underlying natural language and human commonsense. DOLCE is an ontology that focuses on particulars in the sense that its domain of discourse is restricted to them. The project is complete, though the ontology remains available for use.",

Data integration between mouse disease models and human studies is hindered by fundamental differences in the ontologies used by the respective communities to describe the same phenotypes. Common standards and ontologies to bridge the phenotype gap between mouse and human open extensive mouse phenotype data to clinical researchers. \n\nTo develop a comprehensive set of terms to describe Type 2 diabetes and obesity phenotypes in mouse and human, Type 2 Diabetes-related phenotypes were mined from the literature for use as new phenotype terms. Expert clinicians/diabetologists then curated the mined terms and categorised them by temporal disease stages. The ontology was then used for the annotation of mouse and human datasets with specific terminology representing Type 2 Diabetes progression, which will ultimately support translational research.",

AGROVOC uses semantic web technologies, linking to other multilingual knowledge organization systems and building bridges between datasets. Your library can use AGROVOC to index its documents or datasets, or you can use it from inside your content management system (e.g., Drupal) to organize your documents or web site. You can also use AGROVOC as an hub to access many other vocabularies available on the web.  To date, AGROVOC is used by researchers, librarians and information managers for indexing, retrieving and organizing data in agricultural information systems and Web pages. Currently, AGROVOC is an SKOS-XL concept scheme and a Linked Open Data (LOD*) set aligned with over 20 other multilingual knowledge organization systems related to agriculture.

    "description": "The need to represent knowledge about food is central to many human activities including agriculture, medicine, food safety inspection, shopping patterns, and sustainable development. FoodOn is built to interoperate with the OBO Library and to represent entities which bear a food role. Initially the ontology will focus on the human-centric categorization and handling of food, but in the future it will also encompass materials in natural ecosystems and food webs. We aim to develop semantics for food safety, food security, the agricultural and animal husbandry practices linked to food production, culinary, nutritional and chemical ingredients and processes.",

    "description": "Brick is an open-source effort to standardize semantic descriptions of the physical, logical and virtual assets in buildings and the relationships between them. Brick consists of an extensible dictionary of terms and concepts in and around buildings, a set of relationships for linking and composing concepts together, and a flexible data model permitting seamless integration of Brick with existing tools and databases. Through the use of powerful Semantic Web technology, Brick can describe the broad set of idiosyncratic and custom features, assets and subsystems found across the building stock in a consistent matter. Adopting Brick as the canonical description of a building enables the following: 1) Brick lowers the cost of deploying analytics, energy efficiency measures and intelligent controls across buildings, 2) Brick presents an integrated, cross-vendor representation of the multitude of subsystems in modern buildings: HVAC, lighting, fire, security and so on, 3) Brick simplifies the development of smart analytics and control applications, and 4) Brick reduces the reliance upon the non-standard, unstructured labels endemic to building management systems.\n",

Incorporation and comparison of various small molecule screening data sets, such as those deposited in PubChem, ChEMBL, KEGG, PDSP, and/or IUPHAR databases, requires a formalized electronic organization system. In order to bridge the gap between the overflow of HTS data and the bottleneck of integrated analysis tools, herein, we provide the first comprehensive GPCR ontology. The development and utility of GPCR ontology was based on previously developed BioAssay Ontology (BAO). The GPCR ontology contains information about biochemical, pharmacological, and functional properties of individual GPCRs as well as GPCR-selective ligands inclusive of their HTS screening results and other records. This ontology aims to model the relationship between the GPCR binding sites and their physiologic and pharmacologic role in physiology via small molecule chemical structures. ",

    "description": "The digital object identifier (DOI) system originated in a joint initiative of three trade associations in the publishing industry (International Publishers Association; International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers; Association of American Publishers). The system was announced at the Frankfurt Book Fair 1997. The International DOI® Foundation (IDF) was created to develop and manage the DOI system, also in 1997. The DOI system was adopted as International Standard ISO 26324 in 2012. The DOI system implements the Handle System and adds a number of new features. The DOI system provides an infrastructure for persistent unique identification of objects of any type. The DOI system is designed to work over the Internet. A DOI name is permanently assigned to an object to provide a resolvable persistent network link to current information about that object, including where the object, or information about it, can be found on the Internet. While information about an object can change over time, its DOI name will not change. A DOI name can be resolved within the DOI system to values of one or more types of data relating to the object identified by that DOI name, such as a URL, an e-mail address, other identifiers and descriptive metadata. The DOI system enables the construction of automated services and transactions. Applications of the DOI system include but are not limited to managing information and documentation location and access; managing metadata; facilitating electronic transactions; persistent unique identification of any form of any data; and commercial and non-commercial transactions. The content of an object associated with a DOI name is described unambiguously by DOI metadata, based on a structured extensible data model that enables the object to be associated with metadata of any desired degree of precision and granularity to support description and services. The data model supports interoperability between DOI applications. The scope of the DOI system is not defined by reference to the type of content (format, etc.) of the referent, but by reference to the functionalities it provides and the context of use. The DOI system provides, within networks of DOI applications, for unique identification, persistence, resolution, metadata and semantic interoperability.",

Stage-specific instances were presented as uniparental hierarchies organized solely using part-of relationships (i.e. as a strict partonomy). An ‘abstract’ (i.e. non-stage-specific) representation of the mouse developmental anatomy ontology was subsequently developed.\n\nThe mouse developmental anatomy ontology has been substantially extended and refined over many years in a collaborative effort between EMAP and the Gene Expression Database (GXD) project, part of the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) resource at The Jackson Laboratory. The ontology continues to be maintained and expanded by GXD.",

The major achievements of MENELAS are the realisation of its two functional systems: (i) The Document Indexing System encodes free text PDSs into both an internal representation (a set of Conceptual Graphs) and international nomenclature codes (ICD-9-CM). Instances of the Document Indexing System have been realised for French, English and Dutch ; (ii) The Consultation System allows users to access the information contained in PDSs previously indexed by the Document Indexing System. The test domain for the project was coronary diseases. The existing prototype shows promising results for information retrieval from natural language PDSs and for automatically encoding PDSs into an existing classification such as ICD-9-CM. A set of components, tools, knowledge bases and methods has also been produced by the project. These include language-independent ontology and models for the domain of coronary diseases; conceptual description of the relevant ICD-9-CM codes. This ontology includes a top-ontology, a top-domain ontology and a domain ontology (Coronay diseases surgery).

The Provenance Vocabulary is designed as a Web data specific specialization of the W3C PROV Ontology (PROV-O); classes and properties provided by the vocabulary are domain specific extensions of the more general concepts introduced in PROV-O.

The Crop Ontology has been created to compile validated concepts along with their inter-relationships on anatomy, structure and phenotype of Crops, on trait measurement and methods as well as on Germplasm with the multi-crop passport terms. The concepts of the CO are being used to curate agronomic databases and describe the data. The use of ontology terms to describe agronomic phenotypes and the accurate mapping of these descriptions into databases is important in comparative phenotypic and genotypic studies across species and gene-discovery experiments as it provides harmonized description of the data and therefore facilitates the retrieval of information.",

The Read Codes were developed in 1985 by Dr. James Read. The U.K. National Health Service Centre for Coding and Classification (NHS CCC) acquired and now maintains the Read Codes. Read Codes contain hundreds of thousands of terms, synonyms, and abbreviations covering all aspects of patient care including signs and symptoms, treatments and therapies, investigations, occupations, diagnoses, and drugs and appliances. Read Codes are used by healthcare professionals in computerized information systems. Read Codes are now known as Clinical Terms.

This is an essential prerequisite for the ability to compare and contrast metabolite data across different experiments and studies. Over 200,000 names from a set of over 1,100 MS and NMR studies on the Metabolomics Workbench has been used to generate a highly curated analytical chemistry-centric list of common names for metabolite structures and isobaric species. Additionally, the vast majority of these names have been linked to a metabolite classification system using a combination of LIPID MAPS and ClassyFire classification methods. A name-conversion user interface is provided where users can submit a list of metabolite names and map them to the corresponding RefMet names. New metabolites are constantly being added to RefMet, however very new metabolite names generated by metabolomics experiments may not currently map to RefMet identifiers. Nevertheless, RefMet has the ability to greatly increase the data-sharing potential of metabolomics experiments and facilitate \"meta-analysis\" and systems biology objectives for the majority of commonly encountered metabolite species.",

Furthermore, PDO builds the relationships among species, region, morphology, plant organs, developmental stage, revealing the list of species in an area, the morphology and life form of plants, and development process of species. In sum, PDO shows a growth process or development stage of a species and its structure characteristics in particular space and time scale, realizing the description of species diversity, ecosystem diversity and genetic diversity.

Interoperability of linked data can only be guaranteed through the application of tools that provide the means for a continuous validation of generated linked data. The GBOL stack enforces consistency within and between the OWL and ShEx definitions. Genome wide large scale functional analyses can then easily be achieved using SPARQL queries. Additionally, modules have been developed to serialize the linked data (RDF) and to generate a plain text format files with integrated support for data provenance that that mimic the indentation structure of GenBank and EMBL formats.",

Although its structure and use is linked to mzML, mzIdentML and mzQuantML, it is dynamically maintained in a OBO format. The PSI-Mass Spectrometry (MS) CV contains all the terms used in the PSI MS–related data standards. The CV contains a logical hierarchical structure to ensure ease of maintenance and the development of software that makes use of complex semantics. The CV contains terms required for a complete description of an MS analysis pipeline used in proteomics, including sample labeling, digestion enzymes, instrumentation parts and parameters, software used for identification and quantification of peptides/proteins and the parameters and scores used to determine their significance. Owing to the range of topics covered by the CV, collaborative development across several PSI working groups, including proteomics research groups, instrument manufacturers and software vendors, was necessary.",

Both versions provide a standard vocabulary for clinicians to record patient findings and procedures, in health and social care IT systems across primary and secondary care. The Read Codes were developed in 1985 by Dr. James Read. The U.K. National Health Service Centre for Coding and Classification (NHS CCC) acquired and now maintains the Read Codes. Read Codes contain hundreds of thousands of terms, synonyms, and abbreviations covering all aspects of patient care including signs and symptoms, treatments and therapies, investigations, occupations, diagnoses, and drugs and appliances. Read Codes are used by healthcare professionals in computerized information systems. Read Codes are now known as Clinical Terms. Clinical Terms Version 3 (CTV3) has been merged with the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine – Reference Terminology (SNOMED RT), resulting in the creation of SNOMED – Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). PLEASE NOTE: the retirement of Read v2 and v3 (CTV3) clinical terminologies has been scheduled. The last release of Read v2 was April 2016, with CTV3 due to be retired after the April 2018 release. Organisations should be well underway with their preparations to ensure they can use the dictionary of medicines and devices (dm+d) for medicines and SNOMED CT for clinical content.

All Entries can be subjected to an Operation (class from EDAM) producing an Intermediate (P:00010). An Intermediate has a TemporalEntity associated to represent its time of creation. Some Entries are specifically of the type Exit, meaning that they will represent concepts that exit the current category and be passed to the next one on the workflow. Additionally, in order to permit the treatment of a set of objects as a single entity, this high-level ontology considers the concept of List (P:00004) and more specifically an Aggregate (P:00005), containing a set of Data or Entry, respectively. The concept Intermediate is an Entry, allowing for the successive application of an operation to an Element.

By providing descriptions of agronomic, morphological, physiological, quality, and stress traits along with their definitions and relationships, also including a standard nomenclature for composing the variables, the CO enables digital capture and aggregation of crop trait data, as well as comparison across projects and locations (Shrestha et al, 2012). The crop ontologies follow a conceptual model that defines a phenotypic variable as a combination of a trait, a method and a scale. This model aims at supporting the creation and management of breeders’ field books and the generation of annotated trial data. Annotated data are interpretable, interoperable and reusable. The development of a crop-specific ontology is a community-driven effort which is usually coordinated by a curator (or curators) nominated from within the community itself. CO’s Traits that are properly described following the guidelines are progressively mapped to the Planteome species-neutral Trait Ontology (TO) maintained by Oregon State University.",

ICPC-2 PLUS can be used in age-sex disease registers, morbidity registers and full electronic health records in primary care. Primarily used in Australia, ICPC-2 PLUS is used within software packages and electronic health record (EHR) systems. It is also used in research projects, including the BEACH (Bettering the Evaluation And Care of Health) program, the national study of general practice activity. The terminology is therefore often referred to as the BEACH coding system.  ICPC-2 PLUS has been specifically designed by the FMRC for use in computerised clinical systems, recall systems, disease registers and secondary coding of clinical data. It is not part of the ICPC-2 standard. Charges apply for end users of ICPC-2 PLUS. All end users must sign an ICPC-2 PLUS end user contract before being given access to ICPC-2 PLUS. The World Organization of Family Doctors (WONCA) and the WONCA International Classification Committee (WICC) have no control over it although they do have control over the ICPC classification which the PLUS extension makes use of.",
