For each transcript, the region scanned extends from 10,000bp upstream of the transcript start to 50bp downstream of the coding sequence start. Therefore, the database contains putative binding sites in the gene promoter and in the initial introns and non-coding exons. Information displayed for each putative binding site includes the transcription factor name, its position (absolute on the chromosome, or relative to the gene), the score of the prediction, and the region of the gene the site belongs to. If the selected gene has homologs in any of the other two organisms, the program optionally displays the putative TFBSs in the homologs.",

Olfactory GPCRs (oGPCRs) are treated as a separate family. A key aim of the KMC is to classify the development/druggability level of targets. The official public portal for TCRD is Pharos (pharos.nih.gov). Based on modern web design principles the Pharos interface provides facile access to all data types collected by the KMC. Given the complexity of the data surrounding any target, efficient and intuitive visualization has been a high priority, to enable users to quickly navigate & summarize search results and rapidly identify patterns. A critical feature of the interface is the ability to perform flexible search and subsequent drill down of search results. Underlying the interface is a RESTful API that provides programmatic access to all KMC data, allowing for easy consumption in user applications.",

MorphoBank aids development of the Tree of Life - the genealogy of all living and extinct species. Heritable features - both genotypes (e.g., DNA sequences) and phenotypes (e.g., anatomy, behavior, physiology) are stored as part of the Tree of Life project. While the genomic part of this work is archived at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), MorphoBank is part of the infrastructure for storing and sharing phenotype data, including information on anatomy, physiology, behavior and other features of species. One can think of MorphoBank as two databases in one: one that permits researchers to upload images and affiliate data with those images (labels, species names, etc.) and a second database that allows researchers to upload morphological data and affiliate it with phylogenetic matrices. In both cases, MorphoBank is project-based, meaning a team of researchers can create a project and share the images and associated data exclusively with each other. When a paper associated with the project is published, the research team can make their data permanently available for view on MorphoBank where it is now archived.   The phylogenetic matrix aspect of MorphoBank is designed to aid systematists working alone or in teams to build large phylogenetic trees using morphology (anatomy, histology, neurology, or any aspect of phenotypes) or a combination of morphology and molecular data.",

However, there is notable heterogeneity in the application and reporting of these risk scores, which hinders the translation of PRSs into clinical care. These guidelines update the Genetic Risk Prediction Studies (GRIPS) Statement to reflect the present state of the field. Drawing on the input of experts in epidemiology, statistics, disease-specific applications, implementation and policy, this reporting framework defines the minimal information that is needed to interpret and evaluate PRSs, especially with respect to downstream clinical applications. Items span detailed descriptions of study populations, statistical methods for the development and validation of PRSs and considerations for the potential limitations of these scores. In addition, data deposition is encouraged via the PGS Catalog to facilitate reproducibility and comparative benchmarking. By providing these criteria in a structured format that builds on existing standards and ontologies, the aim is to facilitate translation into clinical care and progress towards defining best practice.",

    "description": "The proposed Minimum Information About Particle Tracking Experiments (MIAPTE) reporting guidelines described here aims to deliver a set of rules representing the minimal information required to report and support interpretation and assessment of data arising from intracellular multiple particle tracking (MPT) experiments. Examples of such experiments are those tracking viral particles as they move from the site of entry to the site of replication within an infected cell, or those following vesicular dynamics during secretion, endocytosis, or exocytosis. By promoting development of community standards, MIAPTE will contribute to making MPT data FAIR (Findable Accessible Interoperable and Reusable). Ultimately, the goal of MIAPTE is to promote and maximize data access, discovery, preservation, re-use, and re-purposing through efficient annotation, and ultimately to enable reproducibility of particle tracking experiments.                                                                                                         The MIAPTE guidelines are intended for different categories of users: 1) Scientists with the desire to make new results available in a way that can be interpreted unequivocally by both humans and machines. For this class of users, MIAPTE provides data descriptors to define data entry terms and the analysis workflow in a unified manner. 2) Scientists wishing to evaluate, replicate and re-analyze results published by others. For this class of users MIAPTE provides descriptors that define the analysis procedures in a manner that facilitates its reproduction. 3) Developers who want to take advantage of the schema of MIAPTE to produce MIAPTE compatible tools. MIAPTE consists of a list of controlled vocabulary (CV) terms that describe elements and properties for the minimal description of particle tracking experiments, with a focus on viral and vesicular traffic within cells. As part of this submission we provide entity relationship (ER) diagrams that show the relationship between terms. Finally, we also provide documents containing the MIAPTE-compliant XML schema describing the data model used by Open Microscopy Environment inteGrated Analysis (OMEGA), our novel particle tracking data analysis and management tool, which is reported in a separate manuscript.                                                                  MIAPTE is structured in two sub-sections: 1) Section 1 contains elements, attributes and data structures describing the results of particle tracking, namely: particles, links, segments and trajectories. 2) Section 2 contains details about the algorithmic procedure utilized to produce and analyze trajectories as well as the results of trajectory analysis. In addition MIAPTE includes those OME-XML elements that are required to capture the acquisition parameters and the structure of images to be subjected to particle tracking The current version of the model, MIAPTE v02, is intended to be a Request for Comments (Crocker and Postel, 2008). Members of the scientific and developer communities are invited to collaborate with us to modify, extend, and improve the model.",

It can also be specialized to create new classes and properties to model provenance information for different applications and domains. PROV-O is one serialization of PROV-DM, the other two being PROV-N and PROV-XML. PROV-DM and PROV-O define how to represent provenance on the World Wide Web, and as such additional documentation has been included in this record for PROV-AQ (Access and Query), a note which describes how standard web protocols may be used to locate, retrieve and query provenance records. PROV-DC provides a mapping from Dublin Core to PROV-O, and is listed in this record. For the purpose of this specification, provenance is defined as a record that describes the people, institutions, entities, and activities involved in producing, influencing, or delivering a piece of data or a thing. In particular, the provenance of information is crucial in deciding whether information is to be trusted, how it should be integrated with other diverse information sources, and how to give credit to its originators when reusing it. In an open and inclusive environment such as the Web, where users find information that is often contradictory or questionable, provenance can help those users to make trust judgements.",

It uses an abstract biomedical layer on top of that - OBO-UBO which has been constructed as a proposal to the OBO Foundry. This is meant to support creating a sharable view of core biomedical objects such as biomaterial_entity, and organismal_entity that all biomedical ontologies are likely to need and want to use with the same intended meaning.

The development of component models DatasetMetadata, NDCube, and STC2 form a basis set of models on which this specification should be built. It was decided that the timescale between the release of this model and the subsequent conversion to the component model basis is too short to warrant moving forward. Upon the release of the above component models, it is expected that the Spectral model will be revisited, possibly expanding the scope to cover other products such as Eschelle spectra and TimeSeries. This document should serve as a guide for that work. The content of this model satisfies the requirements for which it was generated, so a simple translation of concepts should be a good starting point.",

By placing PGDBj Ortholog Database as a 'hub' within a suite of resources and databases, the aim is to make reciprocal links between databases containing information about various organisms. Users can find orthologs in different subsets of organisms by searching the database using either amino acid information or keywords. The PGDBj 'amino acid sequence DB' contains 500,000 amino acid sequences from 20 plant species classified in Viridiplantae. The PGDBj Ortholog Database provides gene cluster information based on amino acid sequence similarity. Over 500,000 amino acid sequences of 20 Viridiplantae species were subjected to reciprocal BLAST searches and clustered. Sequences from plant genome DBs (e.g. TAIR10 and RAP-DB) were also included in the cluster with a direct link to the original DB. To provide outgroups in the Viridiplantae comparative analyses, ortholog data sets derived from Cyanobacteria and Deuterostomia are also being analyzed.",

We recently extended the data model to enable the storage and integrated visualization of other quantitative omics data. This includes transcriptomics data from e. g. NCBI GEO, protein-protein interaction information from STRING, functional annotations from KEGG, drug-sensitivity/selectivity data from several public sources and reference mass spectra from the ProteomeTools project.

Moreover, Proteome-pI 2.0 facilitates statistical comparisons of the various prediction methods as well as biological investigation of protein isoelectric point space in all kingdoms of life (updated statistics available at http://isoelectricpointdb2.org/statistics.html). The database includes various statistics and tools for interactive browsing, searching, and sorting. It can be searched and browsed by organism name, average isoelectric point, molecular weight, or amino acid frequencies. Proteins with extreme pI values are also available. For individual proteomes, users can retrieve proteins of interest given the method, isoelectric point, and molecular weight ranges (this particular feature can be highly useful to limit potential targets in the analysis of 2DPAGE gels or before conducting mass spectrometry). Finally, some general statistics (total number of proteins, amino acids, average sequence length, amino acid, and di-amino acid frequencies) and datasets corresponding to major protein databases such as UniProtKB/TrEMBL and the NCBI non-redundant (nr) database have also been precalculated.

For researchers it is essential to be able to compare, evaluate, interpret and reproduce experimental research results published in the literature and databases. Thus, for enzyme research, the STRENDA Commission has established standards for data reporting with the aim to improve the quality of data published in the scientific literature.  The STRENDA Guidelines were developed through extensive interactions with the biochemistry community to define the minimum information that is needed to correctly describe assay conditions (List Level 1A) and enzyme activity data (List Level 1B). However, STRENDA aims neither to dictate or limit the experimental techniques used in enzymology experiments nor to establish a metric for judging the quality of experimental data, but to ensure that data sets are complete and validated, allowing scientists to review, reuse and verify them. The emphasis is on providing useful and reliable information. With the aim to support authors to comprehensively report kinetic and equilibrium data from their investigations of enzyme activities, currently more than 55 international biochemistry journals already included the STRENDA Guidelines in their Instructions for Authors. The STRENDA Commission is continuously consulting the wider science community, reports the progress of its work and discusses new approaches regularly at the Beilstein Enzymology Symposia and in scientific journals.",

SLAP services can be registered in an IVOA Registry of Resources using the VOResource Extension standard, having a unique ResourceIdentifier in the Registry. The SLAP interface is meant to be reasonably simple to implement by service providers. A basic query will be done in a wavelength range for the different services. The service returns a list of spectral lines formatted as a VOTable. Thus, an implementation of the service may support additional search parameters (some which may be custom to that particular service) to more finely control the selection of spectral lines.

Then, it will help users uncover the relative importance of each entity—a gene or a term—within the user input by computing the ranking scores of all entities. Lastly, it will help users hypothesize new gene functions or genotype-phenotype associations by an interactive visual interface of constructed global entity relationship network. The output from BEERE includes: a list of the original entities matched with known relationships in databases; any expanded entities that may be generated from the analysis; the ranks and ranking scores reported with statistical significance for each entity; and an interactive graphical display of the gene or term’s network within data provenance annotations that link out to external data sources.

There are several challenges for scientific reproducibility and bench-to-bedside translation. For example, only research and data that are published actually get disseminated, a phenomenon known as publication bias. Published research reflects to only a small fraction of all data collected, and data that do not lead to publication are largely ignored, hidden away in filing cabinets and hard drives. This results in an abundance of inaccessible scientific data known as “dark data”. Even when research is disseminated, it is usually in the form of summary reports of aggregated data (e.g. averages across individual subjects) such as scientific articles. The fact that the individual subject-level data are inaccessible further contributes to dark data. The spinal cord injury (SCI) community created the ODC-SCI to mitigate dark data in SCI research. The ODC-SCI also aims to increase transparency with individual-level data, enhance collaboration, facilitate advanced analytics, and conform to increasing mandates by funders and publishers to make data accessible. Members of the ODC-SCI have access to a private digital lab space managed by the PI or multi-PIs for dataset storage and sharing. The PIs can share their labs’ datasets with the registered members of the ODC-SCI community and make their datasets public and citable. The ODC-SCI implements stewardship principles that scientific data be made FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) and has been widely adopted by the international SCI research community.",

ConVarT incorporates annotations (including phenotypic and pathogenic) into variants, and these previously unexploited phenotypic OrthoVars from mice and C. elegans can give clues about the functional consequence of human genetic variants. Our analysis shows that many phenotypic variants in different genes from mice and C. elegans, so far, have no counterparts in humans, and thus, can be useful resources when evaluating a relationship between a new human mutation and a disease.",

Adopting such a uniform language for all models allows these to be used in a homogeneous manner and allows a consistent definition of reuse of one model by another. The particular language defined here includes a consistent identification mechanism for model which allows these to be referenced in an explicit and uniform manner also from other contexts, in particular from othe IVOA standard formats such as VOTable. The language defined in this specification is named VO-DML (VO Data Modeling Language). VO-DML is a conceptual modeling language that is agnostic of serializations, or physical representations. This allows it to be designed to fit as many purposes as possible. VO-DML is directly based on UML, and can be seen as a particular representation of a UML2 Profile. VO-DML is restricted to describing static data structures and from UML it only uses a subset of the elements defined in its language for describing \"Class Diagrams\". Its concepts can be easily mapped to equivalent data modelling concepts in other representations such as relational databases, XML schemas and object-oriented computer languages. VO-DML has a representation as a simple XML dialect named VO-DML/XML that must be used to provide the formal representation of a VO-DML data model. VO-DML/XML aims to be concise, explicit and easy to parse and use in code that needs to interpret annotated data sets. VO-DML as described in this document is an example of a domain specific modeling language, where the domain here is defined as the set of data and meta-data structures handled in the IVOA and Astronomy at large. VO-DML provides a custom representation of such a language and as a side effect allows the creation and use of standards compliant data models outside of the IVOA standards context.",

    "description": "The Space-Time Coordinate (STC) metadata for the Virtual Observatory provides a standard for users to specify the spatial coordinates they work in; these will, for most astronomical users, be some flavor of equatorial coordinates. However, there are many variations, not only in terms of different equatorial systems, either from historical collections (FK1-4) or in the uses of Galactic or ecliptic coordinates, but also geographic, barycentric, planetocentric, and instrumental detector coordinates, most of them in spherical as well as Cartesian form. In addition, high-accuracy requirements and special situations such as spacecraft-based observatories create the need for specifying the origin of such coordinate frames – in most cases the location of the observatory. The same is true for time and spectral coordinates: for many applications it may not matter, but there are situations where it is crucial to know what timescale was used, where time was measured, or what inertial standard of rest was used to express the frequency. What this amounts to is that for spatial coordinates it is necessary to know the coordinate system (its type and orientation) and the origin that were used, for time the timescale (UTC, TT, TAI, TDB, etc.) and the spatial reference position, for the spectral coordinate the origin in phase space, and for redshifts (Doppler velocity) the definition as well as the phase space origin. This standard explains the various components, highlights some implementation considerations, presents a complete set of UML diagrams, and discusses the relation between STC and certain other parts of the Data Model. Two serializations are described in this standard document: XML Schema (STC-X) and String (STC-S); the former is an integral part of this Recommendation.",

PolyASite is a portal to the curated set of poly(A) sites inferred from publicly available 3’ end sequencing datasets. It allows efficient finding, exploration and export of poly(A) sites in several organisms. In constructing our poly(A) site atlas, we applied uniform quality measures, including the flagging of putative internal priming sites, to input datasets originating from different 3’ end sequencing techniques, cell types or tissues. Through integrated processing of all data, we identified and clustered sites that are closely spaced and share polyadenylation signals, as these are likely the result of stochastic variations in processing. For each cluster, we identified the representative - most frequently processed - site and estimated the relative use in the transcriptome across all samples. While other existing alternative polyadenylation databases rely on a single experimental method, or on poly(A) site estimation from RNA-seq data, PolyASite is built on data from several 3’ end sequencing techniques. This allows a broader coverage of cell types and poly(A) sites to support further genomics studies.",

The term \"FAIR\" was launched at a Lorentz workshop in 2014, attended by a wide range of academic, corporate, and governmental stakeholders. The resulting draft FAIR Principles were initially made available for public comment via the websites of peer-initiatives such as, for example, Force11. Based on this feedback, the final Principles were published in 2016 (https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618).  FAIR is a set of guiding principles to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable. These guidelines provide advice for those wishing to enhance the (re)usability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals.",

Therefore all the information is collected which is required to understand an experiment. The structure of the file format was inspired by a database structure. In the file are several master elements, which are then referred to in other parts of the file. This structure allows to reduce the amount of redundant information and encourages the user to provide useful information. The Real-time PCR Data Markup Language (RDML) is a structured and universal data standard for exchanging quantitative PCR (qPCR) data. The data standard should contain sufficient information to understand the experimental setup, re-analyse the data and interpret the results. The data standard is a compressed text file in Extensible Markup Language (XML) and enables transparent exchange of annotated qPCR data between instrument software and third-party data analysis packages, between colleagues and collaborators, and between authors, peer reviewers, journals and readers. To support the public acceptance of this standard, both an on-line RDML file generator is available for end users, as well as RDML software libraries to be used by software developers, enabling import and export of RDML data files.",

A SKOS-based thesaurus represents a ‘light-weight’ ontology. This allows us to define in simple terms the relations between similar or equal terms in different terminologies. 5. rdc-mapping: mapping between models, for instance between the SKOS concepts and RD-core and RD-meta. 6. rdc-example-instances: example instances (‘individuals’) to show the model at instance level.

DOLCE is the first module of WFOL and it is not a candidate for a universal standard ontology. Rather, it is intended as a starting point for comparing and elucidating the relationships with the other modules of the library, and also for clarifying the hidden assumptions underlying existing ontologies or linguistic resources such as WordNet.  As reflected by its acronym, DOLCE has a clear cognitive bias, in the sense that it aims at capturing the ontological categories underlying natural language and human commonsense.

With tens of thousands of imaging devices in use, DICOM is one of the most widely deployed healthcare messaging standards in the world. There are literally billions of DICOM images currently in use for clinical care. Since its first publication in 1993, DICOM has revolutionized the practice of radiology, allowing the replacement of X-ray film with a fully digital workflow. Much as the Internet has become the platform for new consumer information applications, DICOM has enabled advanced medical imaging applications that have “changed the face of clinical medicine”. From the emergency department, to cardiac stress testing, to breast cancer detection, DICOM is the standard that makes medical imaging work — for doctors and for patients.",

System biology approaches, that combine genomics, gene co-expression networks and data from genetic studies help provide a view at the systems-level of gene interactions. As co-expressed genes tend to be involved in similar processes, it is expected that co-expressed genes may work together to give rise to specific pheontypes.

However, adherence to community standards does more than just improve reusability of the data. The software used by the community for analysis and visualization often depends on the (meta)data having certain fields; thus, non-compliance with standards may result in the data being unreadable by its associated tools. As such, data should be (individually) certified as being compliant, likely through some automated process (e.g. submitting the data to the community’s online validation service).

These protocols might be satisfied using a single table query. However, different VO services have different needs in terms of query complexity and ADQL arises in this context. The ADQL specification makes no distinction between core and advanced or extended functionalities. Hence ADQL has been built according to a single Backus Naur Form (BNF) based language definition. Any service making use of ADQL would then define the level of compliancy to the language. This would allow the notion of core and extension to be service-driven and it would decouple the language from the service specifications. ADQL is based on the Structured Query Language (SQL), especially on SQL 92 1 2 3. . The VO has a number of tabular data sets and many of them are stored in relational databases, making SQL a convenient access means. A subset of the SQL grammar has been extended to support queries that are specific to astronomy. Similarly to SQL, the ADQL language definition is not semantically safe by design and therefore this specification defines syntactical correctness only. Type safety has been achieved as far as it can be done in SQL.",

We therefore developed the qcML format, an XML-based standard that follows the design principles of the related mzML, mzIdentML, mzQuantML, and TraML standards from the HUPO-PSI (Proteomics Standards Initiative). In addition to the XML format, we also provide tools for the calculation of a wide range of quality metrics as well as a database format and interconversion tools, so that existing LIMS systems can easily add relational storage of the quality control data to their existing schema. We here describe the qcML specification, along with possible use cases and an illustrative example of the subsequent analysis possibilities.",

BEL is intended as a knowledge capture and interchange medium, supporting the operation of systems that integrate knowledge derived from independent efforts. The language is designed to be use-neutral, facilitating the storage and use of structured knowledge for inference by applications through a knowledge assembly process that can create computable biological networks. While BEL does not prescribe any particular assembly process or any particular knowledge format for the output of an assembly process, a suite of software components called the BEL Framework provides everything necessary to create, compile, assemble, and deliver computable knowledge models to BEL-aware applications. The current version of BEL provides the means to describe biological interactions qualitatively but not to quantify the magnitude or rate of these interactions. This limitation is by design because this quantitative information has significant variability and is not consistently reported in the literature. It is our hope that future versions of BEL can accommodate these additional data.",

The Aliases and Classifications section reflects an algorithm for disease name integration across often-conflicting sources, providing effective annotation consolidation. A central feature is a balanced Genes section, with scores reflecting the strength of disease-gene associations. This is accompanied by other gene-related disease information such as pathways, mouse phenotypes and GO-terms, stemming from MalaCards’ affiliation with the GeneCards Suite of databases. MalaCards’ capacity to inter-link information from complementary sources, along with its elaborate search function, relational database infrastructure and convenient data dumps, allows it to tackle its rich disease annotation landscape, and facilitates systems analyses and genome sequence interpretation. MalaCards adopts a ‘flat’ disease-card approach, but each card is mapped to popular hierarchical ontologies (e.g. International Classification of Diseases, Human Phenotype Ontology and Unified Medical Language System) and also contains information about multi-level relations among diseases, thereby providing an optimal tool for disease representation and scrutiny.",

VOEvent is focused on the reporting of photon events, but events mediated by disparate phenomena such as neutrinos, gravitational waves, and solar or atmospheric particle bursts may also be reported. Structured data is used, rather than natural language, so that automated systems can effectively interpret VOEvent packets. Each packet may contain zero or more of the \"who, what, where, when & how\" of a detected event, but in addition, may contain a hypothesis (a \"why\") regarding the nature of the underlying physical cause of the event. Citations to previous VOEvents may be used to place each event in its correct context. Proper curation is encouraged throughout each event's life cycle from discovery through successive follow-ups. VOEvent packets gain persistent identifiers and are typically stored in databases reached via registries. VOEvent packets may therefore reference other packets in various ways. Packets are encouraged to be small and to be processed quickly. This standard does not define a transport layer or the design of clients, repositories, publishers or brokers; it does not cover policy issues such as who can publish, who can build a registry of events, who can subscribe to a particular registry, nor the intellectual property issues.",

GCMD metadata records are now maintained in the Common Metadata Repository (CMR), and the DIF is one of several supported formats for submitting metadata to CMR. The DIF, the ECHO metadata model, and the ISO 19115 standards for science metadata formed the basis for NASA's Unified Metadata Model (UMM) used by CMR.",

More than 125,000 genomes, 516 million genes and almost 100 million unique protein sequences are currently stored in the database. For each bacterial and archaeal genome, MiST 3.0 provides a complete signal transduction profile, thus facilitating theoretical and experimental studies on signal transduction and gene regulation. New software infrastructure and distributed pipeline implemented in MiST 3.0 enable regular genome updates based on the NCBI RefSeq database. A novel MiST feature is the integration of unique profile HMMs to link complex chemosensory systems with corresponding chemoreceptors in bacterial and archaeal genomes.",

    "description": "SCAR (see www.scar.org) is charged with initiating, developing and coordinating high quality international scientific research in the Antarctic region, and advising on the role of the Antarctic region in the Earth system. The scientific business of SCAR is conducted by its Standing Scientific Groups in the Physical-, Life- and Geo- Sciences which represent the scientific disciplines active in Antarctic research. These groups share information on disciplinary scientific research being conducted by national Antarctic programmes; identify research areas or fields where current research is lacking; coordinate proposals for future research by national Antarctic programmes to achieve maximum scientific and logistical effectiveness; identify research areas or fields that might be best investigated by a major SCAR Scientific Research Programme; and establish Action and Expert Groups to address specific research topics within the discipline. SCAR related research data is highly multidisciplinary and disparate. This policy aims to provide a framework for these data to be handled in a consistent manner, and to strike a balance between the rights of investigators and the need for widespread access through the free and unrestricted sharing and exchange of both data and metadata. This policy is compatible with the data principles of SCAR’s parent body, ICSU and other relevant international agencies (e.g. WMO), and with the goals of Article III 1 c of the Antarctic Treaty. Since SCAR coordinates a distributed programme of research, generally implemented through a number of nationally self-managed projects, the principles enshrined in this Data Policy should be applied to data in each SCAR-endorsed Project. In order to be considered part of a SCAR Research Programme, each Project should follow the SCAR Data Policy, submit metadata and linked datasets to the Antarctic Master Directory (AMD - gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Data/portals/amd/) in a reasonable timeframe, and should have an appropriately funded data management plan in place before the Project begins. Nations affiliated with SCAR are urged to establish a National Antarctic Data Centre (NADC) or assign NADC responsibilities to an existing national institution capable of carrying out NADC obligations. NADCs in collaboration with SCAR Research Projects and Programmes will work towards developing a SCAR Antarctic Data and Information System (ADMS). The SCAR Standing Committee on Antarctic Data Management (SCADM) is responsible for this Data Policy. Questions about the policy and its implementation should be directed to the SCADM Executive (see http://scadm.scar.org).",

Utilization of a controlled vocabulary creates opportunities to catalogue genes and expression data for computational searches across research groups and cross-species comparisons, all while establishing a framework for integration of new terms. We created a Planarian Anatomy Ontology containing 327 terms and definitions for cellular organelles, cell types, tissues, organ systems, anatomical entities, life cycle stages and developmental processes described in the literature. Where possible, extant terms and definitions from Uberon and other open source anatomy ontologies were imported into the ontology to strengthen cross-species queries.",

VOTable is designed as a flexible storage and exchange format for tabular data, with particular emphasis on astronomical tables. The VOTable format is an XML standard for the interchange of data represented as a set of tables. In this context, a table is an unordered set of rows, each of a uniform structure, as specified in the table description (the table metadata). Each row in a table is a sequence of table cells, and each of these contains either a primitive data type, or an array of such primitives. VOTable is derived from the Astrores format, itself modeled on the FITS Table format; VOTable was designed to be close to the FITS Binary Table format.",

The DOI system was adopted as International Standard ISO 26324 in 2012. The DOI system implements the Handle System and adds a number of new features. The DOI system provides an infrastructure for persistent unique identification of objects of any type. The DOI system is designed to work over the Internet. A DOI name is permanently assigned to an object to provide a resolvable persistent network link to current information about that object, including where the object, or information about it, can be found on the Internet. While information about an object can change over time, its DOI name will not change. A DOI name can be resolved within the DOI system to values of one or more types of data relating to the object identified by that DOI name, such as a URL, an e-mail address, other identifiers and descriptive metadata. The DOI system enables the construction of automated services and transactions. Applications of the DOI system include but are not limited to managing information and documentation location and access; managing metadata; facilitating electronic transactions; persistent unique identification of any form of any data; and commercial and non-commercial transactions. The content of an object associated with a DOI name is described unambiguously by DOI metadata, based on a structured extensible data model that enables the object to be associated with metadata of any desired degree of precision and granularity to support description and services. The data model supports interoperability between DOI applications. The scope of the DOI system is not defined by reference to the type of content (format, etc.) of the referent, but by reference to the functionalities it provides and the context of use. The DOI system provides, within networks of DOI applications, for unique identification, persistence, resolution, metadata and semantic interoperability.",

The major achievements of MENELAS are the realisation of its two functional systems: (i) The Document Indexing System encodes free text PDSs into both an internal representation (a set of Conceptual Graphs) and international nomenclature codes (ICD-9-CM). Instances of the Document Indexing System have been realised for French, English and Dutch ; (ii) The Consultation System allows users to access the information contained in PDSs previously indexed by the Document Indexing System. The test domain for the project was coronary diseases. The existing prototype shows promising results for information retrieval from natural language PDSs and for automatically encoding PDSs into an existing classification such as ICD-9-CM. A set of components, tools, knowledge bases and methods has also been produced by the project. These include language-independent ontology and models for the domain of coronary diseases; conceptual description of the relevant ICD-9-CM codes. This ontology includes a top-ontology, a top-domain ontology and a domain ontology (Coronay diseases surgery).

This would aim to provide a standard which different organisations maintaining databases could adopt so that they could compare and exchange data with each other without loss of information due to incompatible geographical boundaries. The present publication has resulted from the deliberations over a period of three years of a committee of both taxonomic and applied botanists set up to produce such a standard. The system offered covers the whole world and identifies units at four levels, firstly continental, secondly regional (or subcontinental), thirdly at what may be called \"Botanical Country\" level (which may often ignore purely political considerations), and fourthly at a slightly lower level called \"Basic Recording Units\" where political integrity is fully recognised. In many cases, where Botanical Countries have no complicating political factors, the units at Level-3 and Level-4 are identical. Very large countries, however, have been subdivided into more conveniently sized units according to constituent states or provinces. It is a fundamental principle that units at all levels are bounded either by political boundaries which appear on modern maps or by coast lines. Modern geographical information systems have not superseded the need for such a scheme. While this standard is still in use, it is no longer actively maintained (labelled as prior on the TDWG website).",

The objective was to provide capacity to store and display high quality data regarding Brazil’s Flora within a public institution. The Reflora Virtual Herbarium is designed to allow taxonomists to perform similar procedures to the ones they are used to do within physical collections. In this site they will access, rather than physical specimens, high quality images that can be consulted, re-determined and typified, amongst other functionalities. In due course, the curators of partner institutes will receive periodic and on-demand system reports and will be able to update data in their own collections.  There are currently (2016-10-30) 1922914 images of specimens available in the Reflora Virtual Herbarium. Amongst them, 116925 are nomenclatural types and 525348 are georeferenced records.

    "description": "The Audubon Core metadata schema (\"AC\") is a representation-neutral metadata vocabulary for describing biodiversity-related multimedia resources and collections. Multimedia Resources are digital or physical artifacts which normally comprise more than text. These include pictures, artwork, drawings, photographs, sound, video, animations, presentation materials, interactive online media including identification tool packages involving text and other media. A multimedia collection is an assemblage of such objects whether curated or not and whether electronically accessible or not. For the purposes of this schema we regard a collection of multimedia resources itself as a 'multimedia resource'. Multimedia descriptions are digital records that document underlying multimedia resources. Audubon Core is focused on biodiversity-related multimedia resources. It shares terminology and concerns with many well known and important standards for describing access to resources such as Dublin Core(DC), Darwin Core (DwC), the Adobe Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP), the International Press and Telecommunications Council (IPTC) the Metadata Working Group (MWG) schema, the Natural Collections Schema (NCD), and others. Where there is an exact match to concerns of such standards, Audubon Core adopts their identifiers and definitions. Audubon Core particularly intends to ease the burden of holders of descriptions specified either by DwC or DC by allowing use of those existing descriptions where appropriate.",

The outcome of Protégé is available on the following URL: http://carre.kmi.open.ac.uk/ontology/lifestyle.owl The presented ontology is generic and can support different type of providers (e.g. web searches, Facebook, Twitter etc.). Additionally, the predefined intentions are also generic supporting the majority of intentions in the Web. In the context of CARRE, we utilize, as a first attempt, the web searches as provider and we only upload the relevant intentions (health and travel) to CARRE in the private RDF repository. A user (representing an individual person whose data is being represented using the terms of this ontology) has connections. A connection represents that a Web Lifestyle Data Aggregator of a particular personal computer of user provides intentions for particulars providers. A connection is therefore associated with a UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) that represents an installation of the aggregator. A provider can be the web searches, Facebook or Twitter. A measurement is associated with a provider and a connection in order to declare the connection (i.e. the Web Lifestyle Data Aggregator of a particular personal computer) from which a measurement came. Every measurement must have a date at which the detected intention was taken, a weight which defines the importance of an intention and of course the detected intention that is only relevant to CARRE.",

The protein alignments are mapped back to their corresponding DNA sequences, where distance metrics can be calculated (e.g. molecular distance, Ka/Ks ratio). Sequences are matched using synteny when applicable. Remaining sequences are matched up by using an algorithm for maximizing the score globally, rather than locally, in a bipartite matching. Cutoffs on bits per position and Ks values are set to prevent unlikely \"orthologs\" from being grouped together.

The JPEG compression format was standardised by ISO in August 1990 and commercial applications using it began to show up in 1991. The widely used IJG implementation was first publicly released in October 1991 and has been considerably developed since that time. JPEG JFIF images are widely used on the Web. The amount of compression can be adjusted to achieve the desired trade-off between file size and visual quality. Progressive JPEG is a means of reordering the information so that, after only a small part has been downloaded, a hazy view of the entire image is presented rather than a crisp view of just a small part. It is part of the original JPEG specification, but was not implemented in Web browsers until rather later on, around 1996. It is now fairly widely supported. Although the \"baseline\" variety of JPEG is believed patent-free, there are many patents associated with some optional features of JPEG, namely arithmetic coding and hierarchical storage. For this reason, these optional features are never used on the Web.",

The Gateway includes the ability to search for research projects, publications and health data tools, such as those related to COVID-19. New interactive features provide a community forum for researchers to collaborate and connect and the ability to add research projects. The Innovation Gateway does not hold or store any datasets or patient or health data but rather acts as a portal to allow discovery of datasets and to request access to them for health research. A dataset is a collection of related individual pieces of data but in the case of health data, identifiable information (e.g. name or NHS number) is removed and data is de-identified where possible. When you access the Gateway you will not be able to view or extract the data itself. Instead, you will be able to see information that describes what the different datasets are (e.g. where the dataset has come from, a description of the dataset, the time period and the geographical areas the dataset covers). In order to access the data, you will need to sign in and then follow the access request process.

The \"Brazilian List\", as it was popularly known, closed in November 2015 with the publication of five papers and their respective databases dealing with the different groups of fungi and plants. We enthusiastically present in 2016, the brand new system that houses the Brazilian Flora 2020 project, aiming to achieve Target 1 established for 2020 by the GSPC-CBD. This new project icludes provisions to include descriptions, identification keys and illustrations to all species of plants, algae and fungi known in the country. The Brazilian Flora 2020 project is part of the Reflora Programme and is being conducted with the support of the Sistema de Informação sobre a Biodiversidade Brasileira (SiBBr). At the moment has nearly 700 scientists working in a network to prepare the monographs. These researchers are also responsible for nomenclatural information and geographic distribution (coverage in Brazil, endemism and biomes), as well as valuable data regarding life forms, substrate and vegetation types for each species. The search results on this page include information on endangered species (thanks to the cooperation with the Centro Nacional de Conservação da Flora) and allow access to the Index Herbariorum (due to the collaboration of The New York Botanical Garden).

A novel part of MultiCellDS is the digital cell line: a digital analogue of experimental cell lines that will help to collect biophysical cell line measurements coming from many research groups and make them readily accessible to an ecosystem of compatible computational models. You can learn more about digital cell lines and other core ideas on this page. We are currently preparing a draft of the upcoming MultiCellDS 1.0 specification.

Using state-of-the-art repeat detection methods and manual curation, we systematically annotated the Protein Data Bank, predicting 10 745 repeat structures. In all, 2797 structures were classified according to a recently proposed classification schema, which was expanded to accommodate new findings. In addition, detailed annotations were performed in a subset of 321 proteins. These annotations feature information on start and end positions for the repeat regions and units. RepeatsDB is an ongoing effort to systematically classify and annotate structural protein repeats in a consistent way.

It exists in two variants, a condensed form and a more verbose XML syntax. Sorting rules assure the uniqueness of the condensed form, thus making it suitable as a direct primary key for database applications, which rely on unique identifiers.

It is meant to allow a single query to be posed to TAP services at multiple sites to perform global data discovery without having to understand the details of the services present at each site. It defines a minimal set of basic metadata and thus allows for a reasonable cost of implementation by data providers.",

    "description": "Knowledge of the molecular interactions of human proteins within tissues is important for identifying their tissue-specific roles and for shedding light on tissue phenotypes. However, many protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have no tissue-contexts. The TissueNet database bridges this gap by associating experimentally-identified PPIs with human tissues that were shown to express both pair-mates. Users can select a protein and a tissue, and obtain a network view of the query protein and its tissue-associated PPIs. TissueNet v.2 is an updated version of the TissueNet database previously featured in NAR. It includes over 40 human tissues profiled via RNA-sequencing or protein-based assays. Users can select their preferred expression data source and interactively set the expression threshold for determining tissue-association. The output of TissueNet v.2 underlines qualitative and quantitative features of query proteins and their PPIs. The tissue-specificity view highlights tissue-specific and globally-expressed proteins, and the quantitative view highlights proteins that were differentially expressed in the selected tissue relative to all other tissues. Together, these views allow users to quickly assess the unique versus global functionality of query proteins. Thus, TissueNet v.2 offers an extensive, quantitative and user-friendly interface to study the roles of human proteins across tissues.",

    "description": "When taxonomic descriptions are prepared for input to computer programs, the form of the coding is usually dictated by the requirements of a particular program or set of programs. This restricts the type of data that can be represented, and the number of other programs that can use the data. Even when working with a particular program, it is frequently necessary to set up different versions of the same basic data, for example, when using restricted sets of taxa or characters to make special-purpose keys. The potential advantages of automation, especially in connexion with large groups, cannot be realized if the data have to be restructured by hand for every operation. The DELTA (DEscription Language for TAxonomy) system was developed to overcome these problems. It was designed primarily for easy use by people rather than for convenience in computer programming, and is versatile enough to replace the written description as the primary means of recording data. Consequently, it can be used as a shorthand method of recording data, even if computer processing of the data is not envisaged.",

The major features of probeBase include a classification of probes and primers according to the NCBI taxonomy database, a powerful and customizable search function, which serves to query for target organisms, probe names, primers, target sites, and references. The probeBase match tool can be used to match near-full length rRNA sequences against probeBase and find all published probes targeting the query sequences. The new proxy match tool extends this analysis to partial rRNA sequences, which exploits full-length sequences in the rRNA sequence database SILVA to find published probes potentially targeting partial query sequences. A tool for submitting new or missing probe sequences or references helps to keep probeBase up-to-date.",

The Read Codes were developed in 1985 by Dr. James Read. The U.K. National Health Service Centre for Coding and Classification (NHS CCC) acquired and now maintains the Read Codes. Read Codes contain hundreds of thousands of terms, synonyms, and abbreviations covering all aspects of patient care including signs and symptoms, treatments and therapies, investigations, occupations, diagnoses, and drugs and appliances. Read Codes are used by healthcare professionals in computerized information systems. Read Codes are now known as Clinical Terms. Clinical Terms Version 3 (CTV3) has been merged with the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine – Reference Terminology (SNOMED RT), resulting in the creation of SNOMED – Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). PLEASE NOTE: the retirement of Read v2 and v3 (CTV3) clinical terminologies has been scheduled. The last release of Read v2 was April 2016, with CTV3 due to be retired after the April 2018 release. Organisations should be well underway with their preparations to ensure they can use the dictionary of medicines and devices (dm+d) for medicines and SNOMED CT for clinical content.

Some Entries are specifically of the type Exit, meaning that they will represent concepts that exit the current category and be passed to the next one on the workflow. Additionally, in order to permit the treatment of a set of objects as a single entity, this high-level ontology considers the concept of List (P:00004) and more specifically an Aggregate (P:00005), containing a set of Data or Entry, respectively. The concept Intermediate is an Entry, allowing for the successive application of an operation to an Element. This is particularly useful in the case of the application of sequential set of operations.",

DQV has been conceived as a high-level, interoperable framework that must accommodate various views over data quality. DQV does not seek to determine what \"quality\" means. Quality lies in the eye of the beholder; and there is no objective, ideal definition of it. Some datasets will be judged as low-quality resources by some data consumers, while they will perfectly fit others' needs. There are heuristics designed to fit specific assessment situations that rely on quality indicators, such as pieces of data content, pieces of data meta-information and human ratings, to give indications about the suitability of data for some intended use. DQV re-uses the notions of quality dimensions, categories and metrics to represent various approaches to data quality assessments. It also stresses the importance of allowing different actors to assess the quality of datasets and publish their annotations, certificates, or mere opinions about a dataset.",

In BED, data lines are defined as tab-separated plain text with 12 mandatory fields (columns). Of those, only the first three fields are required, and the other 9 are optional. The proBed format builds upon this original structure by extending the 12 original BED fields to include a further 13 fields to describe information primarily on peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs).

In addition, the analytical dimension characterizes the sequence in terms of its annotations and variants. The web interface enables expressing complex search queries in a simple way; arbitrary search queries can freely combine conditions on attributes from the four dimensions, extracting the resulting sequences. Several example queries on the database confirm and possibly improve results from recent research papers; results can be recomputed over time and upon selected populations.

The Vaccine Ontology (VO) represents various vaccines, vaccine components, and vaccinations. Both OAE and VO are OBO Foundry candidate ontologies and are developed by following the OBO Foundry principles.    To better represent various VAEs and support vaccine safety study, we developed the Ontology of Vaccine Adverse Events (OVAE) as an extension of the biomedical ontologies OAE and VO.",

By providing descriptions of agronomic, morphological, physiological, quality, and stress traits along with their definitions and relationships, also including a standard nomenclature for composing the variables, the CO enables digital capture and aggregation of crop trait data, as well as comparison across projects and locations (Shrestha et al, 2012). The crop ontologies follow a conceptual model that defines a phenotypic variable as a combination of a trait, a method and a scale. This model aims at supporting the creation and management of breeders’ field books and the generation of annotated trial data. Annotated data are interpretable, interoperable and reusable. The development of a crop-specific ontology is a community-driven effort which is usually coordinated by a curator (or curators) nominated from within the community itself.

A huge amount of data is collected either through routine documentation forms (EHRs) for electronic health records or as case report forms (CRFs) for clinical trials. This raises major scientific challenges for health care, since different health information systems are not necessarily compatible with each other and thus information exchange of structured data is hampered. Software vendors provide a variety of individual documentation forms according to their standard contracts, which function as isolated applications. Furthermore, free availability of those forms is rarely the case. Currently less than 5 % of medical forms are freely accessible. Based on this lack of transparency harmonization of data models in health care is extremely cumbersome, thus work and know-how of completed clinical trials and routine documentation in hospitals are hard to be re-used. The MDM-Portal serves as an infrastructure for academic (non-commercial) medical research to contribute a solution to this problem. It already contains more than 6,000 system-independent forms (CDISC ODM Format, www.cdisc.org, Operational Data Model) with more than 470,000 data-elements. This enables researchers to view, discuss, download and export forms in most common technical formats such as PDF, CSV, Excel, SQL, SPSS, R, etc. A growing user community will lead to a growing database of medical forms. In this matter, we would like to encourage all medical researchers to register and add forms and discuss existing forms.",

The model aims at facilitating the manipulation of heterogeneous data in any VO framework or portal. A VO Characterisation instance can include descriptions of the data axes, the range of coordinates covered by the data, and details of the data sampling and resolution on each axis. These descriptions should be in terms of physical variables, independent of instrumental signatures as far as possible.",

Corresponding functional genomics data can be viewed in a genome browser, queried or analyzed via web interfaces, or exported in standard formats like FASTA or BED for subsequent analysis with other tools; of note, EPD is tightly integrated with two tool suites developed by our group: ChIP-Seq (https://ccg.epfl.ch/chipseq) and Signal Search Analysis (https://ccg.epfl.ch/ssa), for analysis of chromatin context and sequence motif respectively. EPD provides promoter viewers, designed with the aim of integrating and displaying information from different sources about, for instance, histone marks, transcription factor-binding sites or SNPs with known phenotypes.

The isoelectric point, the pH at which a particular molecule carries no net electrical charge, is an important parameter for many analytical biochemistry and proteomics techniques, especially for 2D gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), capillary isoelectric focusing, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry and X-ray protein crystallography. The database allows the retrieval of virtual 2D-PAGE plots and the development of customized fractions of proteome based on isoelectric point and molecular weight. Moreover, Proteome-pI facilitates statistical comparisons of the various prediction methods as well as biological investigation of protein isoelectric point space in all kingdoms of life (http://isoelectricpointdb.org/statistics.html). The database includes various statistics and tools for interactive browsing, searching and sorting. It can be searched and browsed by organism name, average isoelectric point, molecular weight or amino acid frequencies. Proteins with extreme pI values are also available. For individual proteomes, users can retrieve proteins of interest given the method, isoelectric point and molecular weight ranges (this particular feature can be highly useful to limit potential targets in analysis of 2DPAGE gels or before conducting mass spectrometry). Finally, some general statistics (total number of proteins, amino acids, average sequence length, amino acid and di-amino acid frequencies) and datasets corresponding to major protein databases such as UniProtKB/TrEMBL and the NCBI non-redundant (nr) database have also been precalculated.",

    "description": "The Proteasix Ontology (PxO) is an ontology that supports the Proteasix tool; an open-source peptide-centric tool that can be used to predict automatically and in a large-scale fashion in silico the proteases involved in the generation of proteolytic cleavage fragments (peptides). PxO aims to describe the known proteases and their target cleavage sites, to enable the description of proteolytic cleavage fragments as the outputs of observed and predicted proteolysis, and to use knowledge about the function, species and cellular location of a protease and protein substrate to support the prioritisation of proteases in observed and predicted proteolysis. Although the Proteasix project website remains active, download / browse links to the ontology are no longer available and the owners of the resource have not confirmed its current status. Therefore we have marked this resource with an Uncertain status. Please get in touch if you can provide FAIRsharing with up-to-date information regarding this resource.",

The datasets are deeply profiled by the sequencing alternative polyadenylation sites (SAPAS) method capable of high-throughput sequencing 3'-ends of polyadenylated transcripts. Thus, APASdb details all the heterogeneous cleavage sites downstream of poly(A) signals, and maintains near complete coverage for APA sites. Furthermore, APASdb provides the quantification of a given APA variant among transcripts with different APA sites by computing their corresponding normalized-reads. In addition, APASdb supports URL-based retrieval, browsing and display of exon-intron structure, poly(A) signals, poly(A) sites location and usage reads, and 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs). Currently, APASdb involves APA in various biological processes and diseases in human, mouse and zebrafish.",

ICPC-2 PLUS can be used in age-sex disease registers, morbidity registers and full electronic health records in primary care. Primarily used in Australia, ICPC-2 PLUS is used within software packages and electronic health record (EHR) systems. It is also used in research projects, including the BEACH (Bettering the Evaluation And Care of Health) program, the national study of general practice activity. The terminology is therefore often referred to as the BEACH coding system.  ICPC-2 PLUS has been specifically designed by the FMRC for use in computerised clinical systems, recall systems, disease registers and secondary coding of clinical data. It is not part of the ICPC-2 standard. Charges apply for end users of ICPC-2 PLUS. All end users must sign an ICPC-2 PLUS end user contract before being given access to ICPC-2 PLUS. The World Organization of Family Doctors (WONCA) and the WONCA International Classification Committee (WICC) have no control over it although they do have control over the ICPC classification which the PLUS extension makes use of.",
