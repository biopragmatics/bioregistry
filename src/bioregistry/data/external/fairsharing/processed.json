While the genomic part of this work is archived at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), MorphoBank is part of the infrastructure for storing and sharing phenotype data, including information on anatomy, physiology, behavior and other features of species. One can think of MorphoBank as two databases in one: one that permits researchers to upload images and affiliate data with those images (labels, species names, etc.) and a second database that allows researchers to upload morphological data and affiliate it with phylogenetic matrices. In both cases, MorphoBank is project-based, meaning a team of researchers can create a project and share the images and associated data exclusively with each other. When a paper associated with the project is published, the research team can make their data permanently available for view on MorphoBank where it is now archived.   The phylogenetic matrix aspect of MorphoBank is designed to aid systematists working alone or in teams to build large phylogenetic trees using morphology (anatomy, histology, neurology, or any aspect of phenotypes) or a combination of morphology and molecular data.",

    "description": "The Polygenic Risk Score Reporting Standards (PRS-RS) provides the minimal information expected of authors to promote the internal validity, transparency, and reproducibility of PRS by requiring authors to detail the study population, statistical methods, and clinical utility of a published score. PRSs, which often aggregate results from genome-wide association studies, can bridge the gap between initial discovery efforts and clinical applications for the estimation of disease risk using genetics. However, there is notable heterogeneity in the application and reporting of these risk scores, which hinders the translation of PRSs into clinical care. These guidelines update the Genetic Risk Prediction Studies (GRIPS) Statement to reflect the present state of the field. Drawing on the input of experts in epidemiology, statistics, disease-specific applications, implementation and policy, this reporting framework defines the minimal information that is needed to interpret and evaluate PRSs, especially with respect to downstream clinical applications. Items span detailed descriptions of study populations, statistical methods for the development and validation of PRSs and considerations for the potential limitations of these scores. In addition, data deposition is encouraged via the PGS Catalog to facilitate reproducibility and comparative benchmarking. By providing these criteria in a structured format that builds on existing standards and ontologies, the aim is to facilitate translation into clinical care and progress towards defining best practice.",

Examples of such experiments are those tracking viral particles as they move from the site of entry to the site of replication within an infected cell, or those following vesicular dynamics during secretion, endocytosis, or exocytosis. By promoting development of community standards, MIAPTE will contribute to making MPT data FAIR (Findable Accessible Interoperable and Reusable). Ultimately, the goal of MIAPTE is to promote and maximize data access, discovery, preservation, re-use, and re-purposing through efficient annotation, and ultimately to enable reproducibility of particle tracking experiments.                                                                                                         The MIAPTE guidelines are intended for different categories of users: 1) Scientists with the desire to make new results available in a way that can be interpreted unequivocally by both humans and machines. For this class of users, MIAPTE provides data descriptors to define data entry terms and the analysis workflow in a unified manner. 2) Scientists wishing to evaluate, replicate and re-analyze results published by others. For this class of users MIAPTE provides descriptors that define the analysis procedures in a manner that facilitates its reproduction. 3) Developers who want to take advantage of the schema of MIAPTE to produce MIAPTE compatible tools. MIAPTE consists of a list of controlled vocabulary (CV) terms that describe elements and properties for the minimal description of particle tracking experiments, with a focus on viral and vesicular traffic within cells. As part of this submission we provide entity relationship (ER) diagrams that show the relationship between terms. Finally, we also provide documents containing the MIAPTE-compliant XML schema describing the data model used by Open Microscopy Environment inteGrated Analysis (OMEGA), our novel particle tracking data analysis and management tool, which is reported in a separate manuscript.                                                                  MIAPTE is structured in two sub-sections: 1) Section 1 contains elements, attributes and data structures describing the results of particle tracking, namely: particles, links, segments and trajectories. 2) Section 2 contains details about the algorithmic procedure utilized to produce and analyze trajectories as well as the results of trajectory analysis. In addition MIAPTE includes those OME-XML elements that are required to capture the acquisition parameters and the structure of images to be subjected to particle tracking The current version of the model, MIAPTE v02, is intended to be a Request for Comments (Crocker and Postel, 2008).

However, STRENDA aims neither to dictate or limit the experimental techniques used in enzymology experiments nor to establish a metric for judging the quality of experimental data, but to ensure that data sets are complete and validated, allowing scientists to review, reuse and verify them. The emphasis is on providing useful and reliable information. With the aim to support authors to comprehensively report kinetic and equilibrium data from their investigations of enzyme activities, currently more than 55 international biochemistry journals already included the STRENDA Guidelines in their Instructions for Authors.

Funded by a grant from the Spencer Foundation and part of ICPSR's Education and Child Care Data Archives at the University of Michigan, CivicLEADS provides a centralized repository for this multi-disciplinary research area, with data being created across education, political science, developmental sciences, and other disciplines. Researchers can access quantitative and qualitative data on a broad range of topics for secondary analysis as well as sharing their own primary research data. CivicLEADS includes datasets from other ICPSR archives and seeks out emerging data collected by studies still in the field. Beyond facilitating the sharing and discovery of data, CivicLEADS seeks to create a learning community around civic education and engagement research. We strive to form relationships with and between investigators and researchers at every level—from students to emeriti faculty. Data shared in this archive have been documented with thorough metadata, and tools drawing upon these metadata allow researchers to explore and compare variables both within and between studies. By providing tutorials, webinars, and in-person training, CivicLEADS connects researchers with data and facilitates the future of civic education and civic action research.",

There are several challenges for scientific reproducibility and bench-to-bedside translation. For example, only research and data that are published actually get disseminated, a phenomenon known as publication bias. Published research reflects to only a small fraction of all data collected, and data that do not lead to publication are largely ignored, hidden away in filing cabinets and hard drives. This results in an abundance of inaccessible scientific data known as “dark data”. Even when research is disseminated, it is usually in the form of summary reports of aggregated data (e.g. averages across individual subjects) such as scientific articles. The fact that the individual subject-level data are inaccessible further contributes to dark data. The spinal cord injury (SCI) community created the ODC-SCI to mitigate dark data in SCI research. The ODC-SCI also aims to increase transparency with individual-level data, enhance collaboration, facilitate advanced analytics, and conform to increasing mandates by funders and publishers to make data accessible. Members of the ODC-SCI have access to a private digital lab space managed by the PI or multi-PIs for dataset storage and sharing. The PIs can share their labs’ datasets with the registered members of the ODC-SCI community and make their datasets public and citable.

ConVarT incorporates annotations (including phenotypic and pathogenic) into variants, and these previously unexploited phenotypic OrthoVars from mice and C. elegans can give clues about the functional consequence of human genetic variants.

The particular language defined here includes a consistent identification mechanism for model which allows these to be referenced in an explicit and uniform manner also from other contexts, in particular from othe IVOA standard formats such as VOTable. The language defined in this specification is named VO-DML (VO Data Modeling Language). VO-DML is a conceptual modeling language that is agnostic of serializations, or physical representations. This allows it to be designed to fit as many purposes as possible. VO-DML is directly based on UML, and can be seen as a particular representation of a UML2 Profile. VO-DML is restricted to describing static data structures and from UML it only uses a subset of the elements defined in its language for describing \"Class Diagrams\". Its concepts can be easily mapped to equivalent data modelling concepts in other representations such as relational databases, XML schemas and object-oriented computer languages. VO-DML has a representation as a simple XML dialect named VO-DML/XML that must be used to provide the formal representation of a VO-DML data model. VO-DML/XML aims to be concise, explicit and easy to parse and use in code that needs to interpret annotated data sets. VO-DML as described in this document is an example of a domain specific modeling language, where the domain here is defined as the set of data and meta-data structures handled in the IVOA and Astronomy at large.

However, there are many variations, not only in terms of different equatorial systems, either from historical collections (FK1-4) or in the uses of Galactic or ecliptic coordinates, but also geographic, barycentric, planetocentric, and instrumental detector coordinates, most of them in spherical as well as Cartesian form. In addition, high-accuracy requirements and special situations such as spacecraft-based observatories create the need for specifying the origin of such coordinate frames – in most cases the location of the observatory. The same is true for time and spectral coordinates: for many applications it may not matter, but there are situations where it is crucial to know what timescale was used, where time was measured, or what inertial standard of rest was used to express the frequency. What this amounts to is that for spatial coordinates it is necessary to know the coordinate system (its type and orientation) and the origin that were used, for time the timescale (UTC, TT, TAI, TDB, etc.) and the spatial reference position, for the spectral coordinate the origin in phase space, and for redshifts (Doppler velocity) the definition as well as the phase space origin. This standard explains the various components, highlights some implementation considerations, presents a complete set of UML diagrams, and discusses the relation between STC and certain other parts of the Data Model.

In constructing our poly(A) site atlas, we applied uniform quality measures, including the flagging of putative internal priming sites, to input datasets originating from different 3’ end sequencing techniques, cell types or tissues. Through integrated processing of all data, we identified and clustered sites that are closely spaced and share polyadenylation signals, as these are likely the result of stochastic variations in processing. For each cluster, we identified the representative - most frequently processed - site and estimated the relative use in the transcriptome across all samples. While other existing alternative polyadenylation databases rely on a single experimental method, or on poly(A) site estimation from RNA-seq data, PolyASite is built on data from several 3’ end sequencing techniques.

A SKOS-based thesaurus represents a ‘light-weight’ ontology. This allows us to define in simple terms the relations between similar or equal terms in different terminologies. 5. rdc-mapping: mapping between models, for instance between the SKOS concepts and RD-core and RD-meta. 6. rdc-example-instances: example instances (‘individuals’) to show the model at instance level.

These protocols might be satisfied using a single table query. However, different VO services have different needs in terms of query complexity and ADQL arises in this context. The ADQL specification makes no distinction between core and advanced or extended functionalities. Hence ADQL has been built according to a single Backus Naur Form (BNF) based language definition. Any service making use of ADQL would then define the level of compliancy to the language. This would allow the notion of core and extension to be service-driven and it would decouple the language from the service specifications. ADQL is based on the Structured Query Language (SQL), especially on SQL 92 1 2 3. . The VO has a number of tabular data sets and many of them are stored in relational databases, making SQL a convenient access means. A subset of the SQL grammar has been extended to support queries that are specific to astronomy. Similarly to SQL, the ADQL language definition is not semantically safe by design and therefore this specification defines syntactical correctness only. Type safety has been achieved as far as it can be done in SQL.",

Quality control is increasingly recognized as a crucial aspect of mass spectrometry based proteomics. Several recent papers discuss relevant parameters for quality control and present applications to extract these from the instrumental raw data. What has been missing, however, is a standard data exchange format for reporting these performance metrics. We therefore developed the qcML format, an XML-based standard that follows the design principles of the related mzML, mzIdentML, mzQuantML, and TraML standards from the HUPO-PSI (Proteomics Standards Initiative). In addition to the XML format, we also provide tools for the calculation of a wide range of quality metrics as well as a database format and interconversion tools, so that existing LIMS systems can easily add relational storage of the quality control data to their existing schema. We here describe the qcML specification, along with possible use cases and an illustrative example of the subsequent analysis possibilities.",

The language is designed to be use-neutral, facilitating the storage and use of structured knowledge for inference by applications through a knowledge assembly process that can create computable biological networks. While BEL does not prescribe any particular assembly process or any particular knowledge format for the output of an assembly process, a suite of software components called the BEL Framework provides everything necessary to create, compile, assemble, and deliver computable knowledge models to BEL-aware applications. The current version of BEL provides the means to describe biological interactions qualitatively but not to quantify the magnitude or rate of these interactions. This limitation is by design because this quantitative information has significant variability and is not consistently reported in the literature.

VOEvent is focused on the reporting of photon events, but events mediated by disparate phenomena such as neutrinos, gravitational waves, and solar or atmospheric particle bursts may also be reported. Structured data is used, rather than natural language, so that automated systems can effectively interpret VOEvent packets. Each packet may contain zero or more of the \"who, what, where, when & how\" of a detected event, but in addition, may contain a hypothesis (a \"why\") regarding the nature of the underlying physical cause of the event. Citations to previous VOEvents may be used to place each event in its correct context. Proper curation is encouraged throughout each event's life cycle from discovery through successive follow-ups. VOEvent packets gain persistent identifiers and are typically stored in databases reached via registries. VOEvent packets may therefore reference other packets in various ways. Packets are encouraged to be small and to be processed quickly. This standard does not define a transport layer or the design of clients, repositories, publishers or brokers; it does not cover policy issues such as who can publish, who can build a registry of events, who can subscribe to a particular registry, nor the intellectual property issues.",

The updated Microbial Signal Transduction (MiST) database provides a comprehensive classification of microbial signal transduction systems. This update is a result of a substantial scaling to accommodate constantly growing microbial genomic data. More than 125,000 genomes, 516 million genes and almost 100 million unique protein sequences are currently stored in the database. For each bacterial and archaeal genome, MiST 3.0 provides a complete signal transduction profile, thus facilitating theoretical and experimental studies on signal transduction and gene regulation. New software infrastructure and distributed pipeline implemented in MiST 3.0 enable regular genome updates based on the NCBI RefSeq database. A novel MiST feature is the integration of unique profile HMMs to link complex chemosensory systems with corresponding chemoreceptors in bacterial and archaeal genomes.",

The scientific business of SCAR is conducted by its Standing Scientific Groups in the Physical-, Life- and Geo- Sciences which represent the scientific disciplines active in Antarctic research. These groups share information on disciplinary scientific research being conducted by national Antarctic programmes; identify research areas or fields where current research is lacking; coordinate proposals for future research by national Antarctic programmes to achieve maximum scientific and logistical effectiveness; identify research areas or fields that might be best investigated by a major SCAR Scientific Research Programme; and establish Action and Expert Groups to address specific research topics within the discipline. SCAR related research data is highly multidisciplinary and disparate. This policy aims to provide a framework for these data to be handled in a consistent manner, and to strike a balance between the rights of investigators and the need for widespread access through the free and unrestricted sharing and exchange of both data and metadata. This policy is compatible with the data principles of SCAR’s parent body, ICSU and other relevant international agencies (e.g. WMO), and with the goals of Article III 1 c of the Antarctic Treaty. Since SCAR coordinates a distributed programme of research, generally implemented through a number of nationally self-managed projects, the principles enshrined in this Data Policy should be applied to data in each SCAR-endorsed Project. In order to be considered part of a SCAR Research Programme, each Project should follow the SCAR Data Policy, submit metadata and linked datasets to the Antarctic Master Directory (AMD - gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Data/portals/amd/) in a reasonable timeframe, and should have an appropriately funded data management plan in place before the Project begins. Nations affiliated with SCAR are urged to establish a National Antarctic Data Centre (NADC) or assign NADC responsibilities to an existing national institution capable of carrying out NADC obligations. NADCs in collaboration with SCAR Research Projects and Programmes will work towards developing a SCAR Antarctic Data and Information System (ADMS). The SCAR Standing Committee on Antarctic Data Management (SCADM) is responsible for this Data Policy. Questions about the policy and its implementation should be directed to the SCADM Executive (see http://scadm.scar.org).",

The DOI system was adopted as International Standard ISO 26324 in 2012. The DOI system implements the Handle System and adds a number of new features. The DOI system provides an infrastructure for persistent unique identification of objects of any type. The DOI system is designed to work over the Internet. A DOI name is permanently assigned to an object to provide a resolvable persistent network link to current information about that object, including where the object, or information about it, can be found on the Internet. While information about an object can change over time, its DOI name will not change. A DOI name can be resolved within the DOI system to values of one or more types of data relating to the object identified by that DOI name, such as a URL, an e-mail address, other identifiers and descriptive metadata. The DOI system enables the construction of automated services and transactions. Applications of the DOI system include but are not limited to managing information and documentation location and access; managing metadata; facilitating electronic transactions; persistent unique identification of any form of any data; and commercial and non-commercial transactions. The content of an object associated with a DOI name is described unambiguously by DOI metadata, based on a structured extensible data model that enables the object to be associated with metadata of any desired degree of precision and granularity to support description and services. The data model supports interoperability between DOI applications. The scope of the DOI system is not defined by reference to the type of content (format, etc.) of the referent, but by reference to the functionalities it provides and the context of use. The DOI system provides, within networks of DOI applications, for unique identification, persistence, resolution, metadata and semantic interoperability.",

This would aim to provide a standard which different organisations maintaining databases could adopt so that they could compare and exchange data with each other without loss of information due to incompatible geographical boundaries. The present publication has resulted from the deliberations over a period of three years of a committee of both taxonomic and applied botanists set up to produce such a standard. The system offered covers the whole world and identifies units at four levels, firstly continental, secondly regional (or subcontinental), thirdly at what may be called \"Botanical Country\" level (which may often ignore purely political considerations), and fourthly at a slightly lower level called \"Basic Recording Units\" where political integrity is fully recognised. In many cases, where Botanical Countries have no complicating political factors, the units at Level-3 and Level-4 are identical. Very large countries, however, have been subdivided into more conveniently sized units according to constituent states or provinces. It is a fundamental principle that units at all levels are bounded either by political boundaries which appear on modern maps or by coast lines. Modern geographical information systems have not superseded the need for such a scheme. While this standard is still in use, it is no longer actively maintained (labelled as prior on the TDWG website).",

The protein alignments are mapped back to their corresponding DNA sequences, where distance metrics can be calculated (e.g. molecular distance, Ka/Ks ratio). Sequences are matched using synteny when applicable. Remaining sequences are matched up by using an algorithm for maximizing the score globally, rather than locally, in a bipartite matching. Cutoffs on bits per position and Ks values are set to prevent unlikely \"orthologs\" from being grouped together.

Progressive JPEG is a means of reordering the information so that, after only a small part has been downloaded, a hazy view of the entire image is presented rather than a crisp view of just a small part. It is part of the original JPEG specification, but was not implemented in Web browsers until rather later on, around 1996. It is now fairly widely supported. Although the \"baseline\" variety of JPEG is believed patent-free, there are many patents associated with some optional features of JPEG, namely arithmetic coding and hierarchical storage. For this reason, these optional features are never used on the Web.",

It provides detailed information about the datasets, which are held by members of the UK Health Data Research Alliance, such as a description, size of the population, and the legal basis for access. The Gateway includes the ability to search for research projects, publications and health data tools, such as those related to COVID-19. New interactive features provide a community forum for researchers to collaborate and connect and the ability to add research projects. The Innovation Gateway does not hold or store any datasets or patient or health data but rather acts as a portal to allow discovery of datasets and to request access to them for health research. A dataset is a collection of related individual pieces of data but in the case of health data, identifiable information (e.g. name or NHS number) is removed and data is de-identified where possible. When you access the Gateway you will not be able to view or extract the data itself. Instead, you will be able to see information that describes what the different datasets are (e.g. where the dataset has come from, a description of the dataset, the time period and the geographical areas the dataset covers). In order to access the data, you will need to sign in and then follow the access request process. Only once your request has been through the process to ensure your application meets all of the requirements and is approved by the data controller will you be able to access the data. Your access to the data will be provided outside of the Gateway in line with the processes of the data controller - read through our FAQs for more information on the process. The datasets that are discoverable through the Innovation Gateway are from organisations in the NHS, research institutes and charities, which are part of the UK Health Data Research Alliance. You can find out more about its members on the UK Health Data Research Alliance website. The information provided about the datasets has been provided by the relevant data controller and is continually updated.",

These researchers are also responsible for nomenclatural information and geographic distribution (coverage in Brazil, endemism and biomes), as well as valuable data regarding life forms, substrate and vegetation types for each species. The search results on this page include information on endangered species (thanks to the cooperation with the Centro Nacional de Conservação da Flora) and allow access to the Index Herbariorum (due to the collaboration of The New York Botanical Garden). Besides this information, users can also access images of herbarium specimens, including nomenclatural types, from both the Reflora Virtual Herbarium and INCT Virtual Herbarium of Flora and Fungi; as well as images of live plants and scientific illustrations with all images included by the experts in each group.",

The expectations arise from seven core principles which align with the core RCUK principles on data sharing. Two of the principles are of particular importance: firstly, that publicly funded research data should generally be made as widely and freely available as possible in a timely and responsible manner; and, secondly, that the research process should not be damaged by the inappropriate release of such data.",

Similarly, for authors submitting protocols of trials, the TIDieR checklist can be referred to when dealing with item 11 of the SPIRIT 2013 checklist (although TIDieR items 10 and 12 are not applicable to protocols as they cannot be completed until the study is complete).",

However, many protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have no tissue-contexts. The TissueNet database bridges this gap by associating experimentally-identified PPIs with human tissues that were shown to express both pair-mates. Users can select a protein and a tissue, and obtain a network view of the query protein and its tissue-associated PPIs. TissueNet v.2 is an updated version of the TissueNet database previously featured in NAR. It includes over 40 human tissues profiled via RNA-sequencing or protein-based assays. Users can select their preferred expression data source and interactively set the expression threshold for determining tissue-association. The output of TissueNet v.2 underlines qualitative and quantitative features of query proteins and their PPIs. The tissue-specificity view highlights tissue-specific and globally-expressed proteins, and the quantitative view highlights proteins that were differentially expressed in the selected tissue relative to all other tissues. Together, these views allow users to quickly assess the unique versus global functionality of query proteins. Thus, TissueNet v.2 offers an extensive, quantitative and user-friendly interface to study the roles of human proteins across tissues.",

This restricts the type of data that can be represented, and the number of other programs that can use the data. Even when working with a particular program, it is frequently necessary to set up different versions of the same basic data, for example, when using restricted sets of taxa or characters to make special-purpose keys. The potential advantages of automation, especially in connexion with large groups, cannot be realized if the data have to be restructured by hand for every operation. The DELTA (DEscription Language for TAxonomy) system was developed to overcome these problems. It was designed primarily for easy use by people rather than for convenience in computer programming, and is versatile enough to replace the written description as the primary means of recording data. Consequently, it can be used as a shorthand method of recording data, even if computer processing of the data is not envisaged.",

There are heuristics designed to fit specific assessment situations that rely on quality indicators, such as pieces of data content, pieces of data meta-information and human ratings, to give indications about the suitability of data for some intended use.

A huge amount of data is collected either through routine documentation forms (EHRs) for electronic health records or as case report forms (CRFs) for clinical trials. This raises major scientific challenges for health care, since different health information systems are not necessarily compatible with each other and thus information exchange of structured data is hampered. Software vendors provide a variety of individual documentation forms according to their standard contracts, which function as isolated applications. Furthermore, free availability of those forms is rarely the case. Currently less than 5 % of medical forms are freely accessible. Based on this lack of transparency harmonization of data models in health care is extremely cumbersome, thus work and know-how of completed clinical trials and routine documentation in hospitals are hard to be re-used. The MDM-Portal serves as an infrastructure for academic (non-commercial) medical research to contribute a solution to this problem. It already contains more than 6,000 system-independent forms (CDISC ODM Format, www.cdisc.org, Operational Data Model) with more than 470,000 data-elements. This enables researchers to view, discuss, download and export forms in most common technical formats such as PDF, CSV, Excel, SQL, SPSS, R, etc. A growing user community will lead to a growing database of medical forms.

The database includes various statistics and tools for interactive browsing, searching and sorting. It can be searched and browsed by organism name, average isoelectric point, molecular weight or amino acid frequencies. Proteins with extreme pI values are also available. For individual proteomes, users can retrieve proteins of interest given the method, isoelectric point and molecular weight ranges (this particular feature can be highly useful to limit potential targets in analysis of 2DPAGE gels or before conducting mass spectrometry).

This study, which is the fruit of collaborative work by scientists at stem cell banks and cellular information registries worldwide, including those in the U.S., the U.K., Europe, and Japan, proposes new minimum information guidelines, Minimum Information About a Cellular Assay for Regenerative Medicine (MIACARM), for cellular assay data deposition. MIACARM was developed based on the existing guideline called MIACA. MIACARM is intended to promote data exchange and facilitation of practical regenerative medicine.",

For instance, Web search engines suggest the use of particular structured metadata elements to optimize search. Thus, the machine-readability aspect can help people and machines find a digital resource of interest. To conform to this metric, a URL to a document that contains machine-readable metadata for the digital resource must be provided. Furthermore, the file format must be specified.

PxO aims to describe the known proteases and their target cleavage sites, to enable the description of proteolytic cleavage fragments as the outputs of observed and predicted proteolysis, and to use knowledge about the function, species and cellular location of a protease and protein substrate to support the prioritisation of proteases in observed and predicted proteolysis. Although the Proteasix project website remains active, download / browse links to the ontology are no longer available and the owners of the resource have not confirmed its current status.

Furthermore, APASdb provides the quantification of a given APA variant among transcripts with different APA sites by computing their corresponding normalized-reads. In addition, APASdb supports URL-based retrieval, browsing and display of exon-intron structure, poly(A) signals, poly(A) sites location and usage reads, and 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs). Currently, APASdb involves APA in various biological processes and diseases in human, mouse and zebrafish.",
