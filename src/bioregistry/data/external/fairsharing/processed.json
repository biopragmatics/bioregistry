The UMLS coverage is quite extensive, including not only many concepts in clinical medicine, but also a large number of concepts applicable to the broad domain of the life sciences. In order to provide an overarching conceptual framework for all UMLS concepts, the UMLS Semantic Network, an upper-level ontology, has been developed. The Semantic Network provides a consistent categorization of all concepts represented in the UMLS Metathesaurus. The links between the semantic types provide the structure for the network and represent important relationships in the biomedical domain. The Semantic Network consists of (1) a set of broad subject categories, or Semantic Types, that provide a consistent categorization of all concepts represented in the UMLS Metathesaurus, and (2) a set of useful and important relationships, or Semantic Relations, that exist between Semantic Types.",

It can also be specialized to create new classes and properties to model provenance information for different applications and domains. PROV-O is one serialization of PROV-DM, the other two being PROV-N and PROV-XML. PROV-DM and PROV-O define how to represent provenance on the World Wide Web, and as such additional documentation has been included in this record for PROV-AQ (Access and Query), a note which describes how standard web protocols may be used to locate, retrieve and query provenance records. PROV-DC provides a mapping from Dublin Core to PROV-O, and is listed in this record. For the purpose of this specification, provenance is defined as a record that describes the people, institutions, entities, and activities involved in producing, influencing, or delivering a piece of data or a thing. In particular, the provenance of information is crucial in deciding whether information is to be trusted, how it should be integrated with other diverse information sources, and how to give credit to its originators when reusing it. In an open and inclusive environment such as the Web, where users find information that is often contradictory or questionable, provenance can help those users to make trust judgements.",

It is intended to improve access to archives by subject, ensure that users of archives can carry out effective subject searches of archives across the UK, and promote the involvement in archives by groups which are under-represented among archive users by providing subject terms which reflect their histories and experiences. UKAT is based on the structure of the UNESCO Thesaurus, and covers education, science, culture, social/human sciences, information, communication, politics, law and economics. UNESCO was used as the basis for UKAT because a number of archives and archive projects, including The Archives Hub, had adopted it for indexing purposes. However, UNESCO sometimes lacks the depth of detailed terminology required by UK archives. UKAT therefore incorporates terms that UK repositories and projects have contributed, or have been sourced from other schemes such as Library of Congress Subject Headings and the British Education Thesaurus. Particular emphasis has been given to incorporating terms reflecting the histories and experiences of groups that are under-represented among archive users. This aims to encourage participation in archival heritage, in line with national priorities for the sector.",

The main parts of this aggregator are: the Resource Retriever, the Resource Rating, the Resource Metadata Processing, and the User Application. The educational metadata involve the Resource Metadata processing module.This module is a combination of 3 services that collect data per article, making multiple SPARQL requests to enrich the data and finally store it as a unique identified resource into the local datastore. Then data is transformed into RDF triples in order to be inserted to CARRE educational repository. The ontology is developed using the Protégé v5.0 , a free, open-source ontology editor from the Stanford University. The ontology is available on CARRE rdf repository among the other ontologies.

DOLCE is the first module of WFOL and it is not a candidate for a universal standard ontology. Rather, it is intended as a starting point for comparing and elucidating the relationships with the other modules of the library, and also for clarifying the hidden assumptions underlying existing ontologies or linguistic resources such as WordNet.  As reflected by its acronym, DOLCE has a clear cognitive bias, in the sense that it aims at capturing the ontological categories underlying natural language and human commonsense. DOLCE is an ontology that focuses on particulars in the sense that its domain of discourse is restricted to them. The project is complete, though the ontology remains available for use.",

The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs, allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every possible identifier. This specification does not define a generative grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual specifications of each URI scheme.",

Through the use of powerful Semantic Web technology, Brick can describe the broad set of idiosyncratic and custom features, assets and subsystems found across the building stock in a consistent matter. Adopting Brick as the canonical description of a building enables the following: 1) Brick lowers the cost of deploying analytics, energy efficiency measures and intelligent controls across buildings, 2) Brick presents an integrated, cross-vendor representation of the multitude of subsystems in modern buildings: HVAC, lighting, fire, security and so on, 3) Brick simplifies the development of smart analytics and control applications, and 4) Brick reduces the reliance upon the non-standard, unstructured labels endemic to building management systems.\n",

It does not cover e.g., scientific name, geography, or physiological facts. This allows combining the GGBN Data Standard with other complementary standards, such as DwC, ABCD or MIxS. Potentially, the standard can be used not only for non-human genomic samples but also human samples. It builds upon existing standards commonly used within the communities extending them with the capability to exchange data on tissue, environmental and DNA sample as well as sequences. The GGBN Data Standard is intended to be used with ABCD or Darwin Core and is not a stand-alone solution. It is intended to replace the DNA extension for Access to Biological Collection Data (ABCDDNA), however that specification has not been formally deprecated.",

    "description": "The digital object identifier (DOI) system originated in a joint initiative of three trade associations in the publishing industry (International Publishers Association; International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers; Association of American Publishers). The system was announced at the Frankfurt Book Fair 1997. The International DOI® Foundation (IDF) was created to develop and manage the DOI system, also in 1997. The DOI system was adopted as International Standard ISO 26324 in 2012. The DOI system implements the Handle System and adds a number of new features. The DOI system provides an infrastructure for persistent unique identification of objects of any type. The DOI system is designed to work over the Internet. A DOI name is permanently assigned to an object to provide a resolvable persistent network link to current information about that object, including where the object, or information about it, can be found on the Internet. While information about an object can change over time, its DOI name will not change. A DOI name can be resolved within the DOI system to values of one or more types of data relating to the object identified by that DOI name, such as a URL, an e-mail address, other identifiers and descriptive metadata. The DOI system enables the construction of automated services and transactions. Applications of the DOI system include but are not limited to managing information and documentation location and access; managing metadata; facilitating electronic transactions; persistent unique identification of any form of any data; and commercial and non-commercial transactions. The content of an object associated with a DOI name is described unambiguously by DOI metadata, based on a structured extensible data model that enables the object to be associated with metadata of any desired degree of precision and granularity to support description and services. The data model supports interoperability between DOI applications. The scope of the DOI system is not defined by reference to the type of content (format, etc.) of the referent, but by reference to the functionalities it provides and the context of use. The DOI system provides, within networks of DOI applications, for unique identification, persistence, resolution, metadata and semantic interoperability.",

The major achievements of MENELAS are the realisation of its two functional systems: (i) The Document Indexing System encodes free text PDSs into both an internal representation (a set of Conceptual Graphs) and international nomenclature codes (ICD-9-CM). Instances of the Document Indexing System have been realised for French, English and Dutch ; (ii) The Consultation System allows users to access the information contained in PDSs previously indexed by the Document Indexing System. The test domain for the project was coronary diseases. The existing prototype shows promising results for information retrieval from natural language PDSs and for automatically encoding PDSs into an existing classification such as ICD-9-CM. A set of components, tools, knowledge bases and methods has also been produced by the project. These include language-independent ontology and models for the domain of coronary diseases; conceptual description of the relevant ICD-9-CM codes. This ontology includes a top-ontology, a top-domain ontology and a domain ontology (Coronay diseases surgery).

Over 200,000 names from a set of over 1,100 MS and NMR studies on the Metabolomics Workbench has been used to generate a highly curated analytical chemistry-centric list of common names for metabolite structures and isobaric species. Additionally, the vast majority of these names have been linked to a metabolite classification system using a combination of LIPID MAPS and ClassyFire classification methods. A name-conversion user interface is provided where users can submit a list of metabolite names and map them to the corresponding RefMet names. New metabolites are constantly being added to RefMet, however very new metabolite names generated by metabolomics experiments may not currently map to RefMet identifiers. Nevertheless, RefMet has the ability to greatly increase the data-sharing potential of metabolomics experiments and facilitate \"meta-analysis\" and systems biology objectives for the majority of commonly encountered metabolite species.",

In particular, it seeks to represent what is involved in the gathering of data from the web and social lifestyle of user on the Internet. We decided, therefore, to develop the ontology using the Protégé v5.0, a free, open-source ontology editor from the Stanford University. The outcome of Protégé is available on the following URL: http://carre.kmi.open.ac.uk/ontology/lifestyle.owl The presented ontology is generic and can support different type of providers (e.g. web searches, Facebook, Twitter etc.). Additionally, the predefined intentions are also generic supporting the majority of intentions in the Web. In the context of CARRE, we utilize, as a first attempt, the web searches as provider and we only upload the relevant intentions (health and travel) to CARRE in the private RDF repository. A user (representing an individual person whose data is being represented using the terms of this ontology) has connections. A connection represents that a Web Lifestyle Data Aggregator of a particular personal computer of user provides intentions for particulars providers. A connection is therefore associated with a UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) that represents an installation of the aggregator. A provider can be the web searches, Facebook or Twitter. A measurement is associated with a provider and a connection in order to declare the connection (i.e. the Web Lifestyle Data Aggregator of a particular personal computer) from which a measurement came. Every measurement must have a date at which the detected intention was taken, a weight which defines the importance of an intention and of course the detected intention that is only relevant to CARRE.",

The classes of PDO also capture the habitat, environmental conditions and expand the general characteristics of plants, completing the instances richness for plant species, geographical, classification and morphology. Furthermore, PDO builds the relationships among species, region, morphology, plant organs, developmental stage, revealing the list of species in an area, the morphology and life form of plants, and development process of species. In sum, PDO shows a growth process or development stage of a species and its structure characteristics in particular space and time scale, realizing the description of species diversity, ecosystem diversity and genetic diversity. At present, PDO has been applied to the platform of Go to Selected Open Access Journals (GoOA) developed by National Science Library of Chinese Academy of Sciences, supporting concept retrieval and concept extension for GoOA.",

Anatomical terms are arranged as a hierarchy from body region or organ system to tissue substructure. Modeling the anatomy hierarchically makes it possible to record expression results from assays with differing spatial resolution in a consistent and integrated manner. Organizing the anatomical terms as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), i.e., in which a term can have more than one parent, allows presentation of the anatomy from multiple perspectives. In various locations, this ontology is also referred to as:  'Mouse Adult Gross Anatomy ontology', 'Adult Mouse Anatomy',  'Mouse Anatomy' or 'Mouse anatomical entity'. ",

GBOL is modular in design, extendible and is integrated with existing ontologies. Interoperability of linked data can only be guaranteed through the application of tools that provide the means for a continuous validation of generated linked data. The GBOL stack enforces consistency within and between the OWL and ShEx definitions. Genome wide large scale functional analyses can then easily be achieved using SPARQL queries. Additionally, modules have been developed to serialize the linked data (RDF) and to generate a plain text format files with integrated support for data provenance that that mimic the indentation structure of GenBank and EMBL formats.",

The Read Codes were developed in 1985 by Dr. James Read. The U.K. National Health Service Centre for Coding and Classification (NHS CCC) acquired and now maintains the Read Codes. Read Codes contain hundreds of thousands of terms, synonyms, and abbreviations covering all aspects of patient care including signs and symptoms, treatments and therapies, investigations, occupations, diagnoses, and drugs and appliances. Read Codes are used by healthcare professionals in computerized information systems. Read Codes are now known as Clinical Terms. Clinical Terms Version 3 (CTV3) has been merged with the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine – Reference Terminology (SNOMED RT), resulting in the creation of SNOMED – Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). PLEASE NOTE: the retirement of Read v2 and v3 (CTV3) clinical terminologies has been scheduled. The last release of Read v2 was April 2016, with CTV3 due to be retired after the April 2018 release. Organisations should be well underway with their preparations to ensure they can use the dictionary of medicines and devices (dm+d) for medicines and SNOMED CT for clinical content. SNOMED CT is adopted across primary care and the wider NHS.",

All Entries can be subjected to an Operation (class from EDAM) producing an Intermediate (P:00010). An Intermediate has a TemporalEntity associated to represent its time of creation. Some Entries are specifically of the type Exit, meaning that they will represent concepts that exit the current category and be passed to the next one on the workflow. Additionally, in order to permit the treatment of a set of objects as a single entity, this high-level ontology considers the concept of List (P:00004) and more specifically an Aggregate (P:00005), containing a set of Data or Entry, respectively. The concept Intermediate is an Entry, allowing for the successive application of an operation to an Element. This is particularly useful in the case of the application of sequential set of operations.",

    "description": "Created in 2008 by the CGIAR, the Crop Ontology (CO; http://www.cropontology.org) is an essential source of traits and variables to support the standardization of the breeding databases such as the Integrated Breeding Platform’s BMS (IBP; https://www.integratedbreeding.net/) and the Boyce Thompson Institute’s Breedbase (https://breedbase.org/) (Arnaud et al., 2020). By providing descriptions of agronomic, morphological, physiological, quality, and stress traits along with their definitions and relationships, also including a standard nomenclature for composing the variables, the CO enables digital capture and aggregation of crop trait data, as well as comparison across projects and locations (Shrestha et al, 2012). The crop ontologies follow a conceptual model that defines a phenotypic variable as a combination of a trait, a method and a scale. This model aims at supporting the creation and management of breeders’ field books and the generation of annotated trial data. Annotated data are interpretable, interoperable and reusable. The development of a crop-specific ontology is a community-driven effort which is usually coordinated by a curator (or curators) nominated from within the community itself.
