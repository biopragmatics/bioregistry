ACFORMAT	Audubon Core Controlled Vocabulary for Dublin Core format	http://rs.tdwg.org/ac/doc/format/	Audubon Core borrows the Dublin Core terms dc:format and dcterms:format to provide information about the physical or electronic format of a media item. This controlled vocabulary provides values for those two terms.
ACSUBTYPE	Audubon Core subtype Controlled Vocabulary	http://rs.tdwg.org/ac/doc/subtype/	Audubon Core uses the terms ac:subtype and ac:subtypeLiteral to refine the type of a media item to a level more specific than the Dublin Core Type Vocabulary, http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/. This controlled vocabulary provides values for ac:subtype and ac:subtypeLiteral.
ACVARIANT	Audubon Core variant Controlled Vocabulary	http://rs.tdwg.org/ac/doc/variant/	Audubon Core uses the terms ac:variant and ac:variantLiteral to provide information about the size, extent, and availability of the Service Access Point of a media item. This controlled vocabulary provides values for those terms.
ALIENSPECIES	Alien Species Thesaurus		The Alien Species Thesaurus is an initiative to deal with the semantics about alien and invasive species. It has been developed and published by LifeWatch Italy, the Italian node of the e-science European infrastructure for biodiversity and ecosystem research (LifeWatch ERIC). It is developed on the basis of already existing glossaries created within the framework of international initiatives aimed at the study of alien and invasive species. The terms (or concepts) are shared very broadly by the scientific community, and their definitions derive from guidelines prepared by relevant international organizations, and only in few occasions by peer reviewed papers. The Thesaurus currently consists of 157 terms.
BIODIVTHES	Biodiversity Thesaurus	https://www.loterre.fr/skosmos/BLH/en/	This bilingual thesaurus organizes the key concepts of biodiversity sciences, in their basic and applied ecological components. It uses polyhierarchy and includes 818 reciprocal associative relationships. The 1654 French and English descriptors (designating 827 concepts) are enriched with a large number of synonyms (1860) and hidden variants (7020) in both languages. Concepts are grouped into 82 collections, by semantic categories, thematic fields and EBV classes (Essential Biodiversity Variables). Definitions are given with their sources. This resource is aligned with the international thesauri AGROVOC, GEMET (GEneral Multilingual Environmental Thesaurus) and EnvThes (Environmental Thesaurus), as well as with the ontology ENVO (Environment Ontology).
DSW	Darwin-SW	https://github.com/darwin-sw/dsw	Darwin-SW (DSW) is an RDF vocabulary designed to complement the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) Darwin Core Standard. DSW is based on a model derived from a community discussion about the relationships among the main Darwin Core classes.
DWCDOE	Darwin Core Degree of Establishment Controlled Vocabulary	http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/doc/doe/	The Darwin Core term degreeOfEstablishment provides information about degree to which an Organism survives, reproduces, and expands its range at the given place and time.. The Degree of Establishment Controlled Vocabulary provides terms that should be used as values for dwc:degreeOfEstablishment and dwciri:degreeOfEstablishment.
DWCEM	Darwin Core Establishment Means Controlled Vocabulary	http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/doc/em/	The Darwin Core term establishmentMeans provides information about whether an organism or organisms have been introduced to a given place and time through the direct or indirect activity of modern humans. The Establishment Means Controlled Vocabulary provides terms that should be used as values for dwc:establishmentMeans and dwciri:establishmentMeans.
DWCPW	Darwin Core Pathway Controlled Vocabulary	http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/doc/pw/	The Darwin Core term pathway provides information about the process by which an Organism came to be in a given place at a given time. The Pathway Controlled Vocabulary provides terms that should be used as values for dwc:pathway and dwciri:pathway.
ENDEMISMS	Endemisms Thesaurus	http://thesauri.lifewatchitaly.eu/endemisms/	Thesaurus on endemisms
ENVTHES	Environmental Thesaurus	http://vocabs.lter-europe.net/EnvThes/	EnvThes compiles a set of terms in order to describe in a harmonised way data resulting from observations and measurements of ecosystem processes across different domain specific sciences. It is used by DEIMS-SDR for common keywords for annotation and quering metadata purposes.
EURIO	eurio	https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/dataset/-/resource?uri=http://publications.europa.eu/resource/dataset/eurio	EURIO (EUropean Research Information Ontology) conceptualises, formally encodes and makes available in an open, structured and machine-readable format data about resarch projects funded by the EU's framework programmes for research and innovation.
EUROSCIVOC	EuroSciVoc	http://publications.europa.eu/resource/dataset/euroscivoc	European Science Vocabulary (EuroSciVoc) is the taxonomy of fields of science based on OECD's 2015 Frascati Manual taxonomy. It was extended with fields of science categories extracted from CORDIS content through a semi-automatic process developed with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
EUROVOC	EuroVoc Core Concepts	http://publications.europa.eu/resource/dataset/eurovoc	EuroVoc is a multilingual, multidisciplinary thesaurus covering the activities of the EU. It contains terms in 24 EU languages, plus in three languages of countries which are candidate for EU accession. EuroVoc is managed by the Publications Office of the European Union, which moved forward to ontology-based thesaurus management and semantic web technologies conformant to W3C recommendations as well as latest trends in thesaurus standards. EuroVoc users include the European Union institutions, the Publications Office of the EU, national and regional parliaments in Europe, plus national governments and private users around the world. EcoPortal is currently hosting the core concepts of EuroVoc, including all their attributes, except alternative labels.
FISHTRAITS	Fish Traits Thesaurus	http://thesauri.lifewatchitaly.eu/fishTraits/index.php	The Fish Traits Thesaurus is the first initiative to deal with the semantics of fish functional traits. It has been developed by LifeWatch Italy, the Italian node of the e-science European infrastructure for biodiversity and ecosystem research (LifeWatch ERIC). FishTraits reflects the agreement of a scientific expert community to fix semantic properties (e.g. label, definition, relationships) of approximately 220 concepts.
LUPO	LifeWatch ERIC Upper Ontology	http://ecoportal.lifewatch.eu/ontologies/LUPO	The LifeWatch ERIC UpperÂ Ontology (LUPO) is the model defining the core set of LifeWatch ERIC elements (Actors, Services and Infrastructure) and describing their high-level arrangement. LUPO is extendable and will foster, connect and describe lower level models of its core elements, with the vision to provide functionalities that facilitate the uptake, re-use and enrichment of LifeWatch ERIC resources by an ever broader community.
