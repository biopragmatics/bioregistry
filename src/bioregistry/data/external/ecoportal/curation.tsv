ACFORMAT	Audubon Core Controlled Vocabulary for Dublin Core format	http://rs.tdwg.org/ac/doc/format/	Audubon Core borrows the Dublin Core terms dc:format and dcterms:format to provide information about the physical or electronic format of a media item. This controlled vocabulary provides values for those two terms.
ACSUBTYPE	Audubon Core subtype Controlled Vocabulary	http://rs.tdwg.org/ac/doc/subtype/	Audubon Core uses the terms ac:subtype and ac:subtypeLiteral to refine the type of a media item to a level more specific than the Dublin Core Type Vocabulary, http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/. This controlled vocabulary provides values for ac:subtype and ac:subtypeLiteral.

ALIENSPECIES	Alien Species Thesaurus		The Alien Species Thesaurus is an initiative to deal with the semantics about alien and invasive species. It has been developed and published by LifeWatch Italy, the Italian node of the e-science European infrastructure for biodiversity and ecosystem research (LifeWatch ERIC). It is developed on the basis of already existing glossaries created within the framework of international initiatives aimed at the study of alien and invasive species. The terms (or concepts) are shared very broadly by the scientific community, and their definitions derive from guidelines prepared by relevant international organizations, and only in few occasions by peer reviewed papers. The Thesaurus currently consists of 157 terms.
BIODIVTHES	Biodiversity Thesaurus		This bilingual thesaurus organizes the key concepts of biodiversity sciences, in their basic and applied ecological components. It uses polyhierarchy and includes 818 reciprocal associative relationships. The 1654 French and English descriptors (designating 827 concepts) are enriched with a large number of synonyms (1860) and hidden variants (7020) in both languages. Concepts are grouped into 82 collections, by semantic categories, thematic fields and EBV classes (Essential Biodiversity Variables). Definitions are given with their sources. This resource is aligned with the international thesauri AGROVOC, GEMET (GEneral Multilingual Environmental Thesaurus) and EnvThes (Environmental Thesaurus), as well as with the ontology ENVO (Environment Ontology).

EUROVOC	EuroVoc Core Concepts	https://op.europa.eu/s/y4TH	EuroVoc is a multilingual, multidisciplinary thesaurus covering the activities of the EU. It contains terms in 24 EU languages, plus in three languages of countries which are candidate for EU accession. EuroVoc is managed by the Publications Office of the European Union, which moved forward to ontology-based thesaurus management and semantic web technologies conformant to W3C recommendations as well as latest trends in thesaurus standards. EuroVoc users include the European Union institutions, the Publications Office of the EU, national and regional parliaments in Europe, plus national governments and private users around the world. EcoPortal is currently hosting the core concepts of EuroVoc, including all their attributes, except alternative labels.
FISHTRAITS	Fish Traits Thesaurus		The Fish Traits Thesaurus is the first initiative to deal with the semantics of fish functional traits. It has been developed by LifeWatch Italy, the Italian node of the e-science European infrastructure for biodiversity and ecosystem research (LifeWatch ERIC). FishTraits reflects the agreement of a scientific expert community to fix semantic properties (e.g. label, definition, relationships) of approximately 220 concepts.
I-ADOPT	I-ADOPT Framework ontology		"The I-ADOPT Framework is an ontology designed to facilitate interoperability between existing variable description models (including ontologies, taxonomy, and structured controlled vocabularies). One of the challenges in representing semantic descriptions of variables is getting people to agree about what they mean when describing the components that define the variables. The I-ADOPT ontology addresses this by providing core components and their relations that can be applied to define machine-interpretable variable descriptions that re-use FAIR vocabulary terms. It was developed by a core group of terminology experts and users from the Research Data Alliance (RDA) InteroperAble Descriptions of Observable Property Terminology (I-ADOPT) Working Group. The first published versions of the ontology up to v0.9.1 satisfied the basic cross-domain interoperability requirements. It defines four classes or ""concepts"" (Variable, Property, Entity, Constraint), and six object properties (hasProperty, hasObjectOfInterest, hasContextObject, hasMatrix, hasConstraint, constrains). The Variable is the top concept. It represents the description of something observed or mathematically derived. It minimally consists of one entity (the ObjectOfInterest) and its Property; a Property being a type of characteristic (i.e. a quantity or a quality). More complex variables can involve additional entities, for example an entity may have the role of Matrix and/or of ContextObject(s). The framework does not capture units, instruments, methods, and geographical location information; however its usage recommendation will make explicit reference to these by connecting the I-ADOPT framework to existing and complementary ontologies. This new version of the ontology (v1.0) adds one optional new class (VariableSet) and four optional new object properties (hasApplicableProperty, hasApplicableObjectOfInterest, hasApplicableMatrix, hasApplicableContextObject). This was necessary in order to enable flexibility in assigning optional and user-defined machine-interpretable categorizations of I-ADOPT variables under one or multiple coarser grouping concepts to facilitate dataset discovery and dataset aggregation. With the introduction of these concepts and properties, the framework enables different user communities or product developers to develop their own grouping criteria. While the Variable class must be connected to at least two classes via the mandatory properties hasProperty and hasObjectOIfInterest, the VariableSet class can have either of the new properties. Additionally, the VariableSet class can also be optionally connected to the Variable class using the property [ro:hasMember](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002351) from the [OBO Relations Ontology](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/ro.html)."
LUPO	LifeWatch ERIC Upper Ontology		The LifeWatch ERIC UpperÂ Ontology (LUPO) is the model defining the core set of LifeWatch ERIC elements (Actors, Services and Infrastructure) and describing their high-level arrangement.
