ahfs	ahfs.ptcs							AHFS	AHFS Pharmacologic-Therapeutic Classification System	The AHFS Pharmacologic-Therapeutic classification originated as an adaptation of the drug classification used to organize the University of Michigan's Hospital Formulary of Selected Drugs. The principal change reflected in the 1959 adaptation was the incorporation of a hierarchical numeric structure to the alpha description of the drug classes and subclasses. The AHFS classification allows the grouping of drugs with similar pharmacologic, therapeutic, and/or chemical characteristics in a 4-tier hierarchy. There are 31 classifications in the first tier, 185 in the second tier, 256 in the third tier, and 94 in the fourth tier		American Society of Health-System Pharmacists	terminology		http://www.ahfsdruginformation.com/class/index.aspx	yes			http://www.ahfsdruginformation.com/class/index.aspx	The AHFS Pharmacologic-Therapeutic Classification System may be licensed from the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.

This vocabulary provides a flat list of Darwin Core terms intended as a glossary of terms (in other contexts these might be called properties, elements, fields, columns, attributes, or concepts). Darwin Core is intended to facilitate the sharing of information about biological diversity by providing reference definitions, examples, and commentaries. The Darwin Core is primarily based on taxa, their occurrence in nature as documented by observations, specimens, and samples, and related information.  The Darwin Core term translations cause parse error here in BioPortal. We are exploring the cause of this parse error. The Darwin Core terms and term translations are described as a flat list of terms. The DwC RDF resource can be seen as a minimal however valid OWL full ontology.			terminology		http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/													omitted

In this backdrop, we have developed a comprehensive ontology on primary and established cell lines-both normal and pathologic. It covers around 400 cell lines. This ontology has been built to include the major domains in the field of biology like anatomy, bio-molecules, chemicals and drugs, pathological conditions and genetic variations around the cell lines. An extensive network of relations has been built across these concepts to enable different combinations of queries.

WSIO is however independent of the application domain and relevant for any SOAP Web services. If the interaction scenario with a Web service is nontrivial (and incorporates session handling), annotation with WSIO concepts will enable automatic generation of client programs, scripts, or interactive applications with a graphical user interface. WSIO also enables automation of different ways of data transfer and data un-/compression or en-/decoding. We strongly discourage providers from developing complex interaction and data-transfer/compression scenarios, however when needed, WSIO will enable smooth automated interaction with them. Future versions will support more interaction scenarios. WSIO aims to serve also as a means to standardise the complex interaction scenarios within SOAP Web services.			terminology	obo	http://wsio.org								_data					omitted
