It is also believed that chromosome 7 carries loci for a number of neuropsychiatric diseases e.g. autism, alcoholism, bipolar affective disorder, panic disorder and schizophrenia. Although it has not yet been identified, cytogenetic evidence suggests that chromosome 7 carries a gene that causes cancer.

  "description": "FLJ is a sequence analysis database that is focused on mRNA variations of human genome and cDNA sequences. There are about 20 to 25 thousand human genes and 100 thousand mRNA varieties, which are apparently caused by transcription start site (TSS) variations and splicing. \nIn the previous human cDNA project, approximately 30 thousand FLJ human full-length sequenced cDNAs were deposited in DDBJ/GenBank/EMBL, and approximately 1.4 million of 5'-end sequences (5'-EST) of FLJ full-length cDNAs from approximately 100 kinds of cDNA libraries of human tissues and cells that were constructed by the oligo-capping method were obtained. These FLJ cDNAs included approximately 80% of all human genes. In the project we developed an efficient splicing variant cDNA cloning and evaluation system, obtaining more than a thousand full-length sequenced cDNAs, which we used with the human genome to construct a sequence analysis database focused on mRNA variations.",

Models are manually curated with assigning model quality ratings  based upon  benchmark studies or inherited from HOCOMOCO v9.\nChIP-Seq data for motif discovery was extracted from GTRD database of BioUML platform, that also provides an interface for motif finding (sequence scanning) with HOCOMOCO models. Other  sequences of TF binding DNA regions were collected from existing databases and other public data.  An appropriate TFBS model was selected for each TF, with similar models selected for related TFs.\nAll TFBS models and initial binding segments data used for motif discovery were mapped to UniPROT IDs. TF coding genes are linked with GeneCards entries. DNA binding domains are linked with TF class database.",

This is achieved through the systematic and automated representation of metal-binding sites in proteins and nucleic acids by way of Minimal Functional Sites (MFSs). MFSs are three-dimensional templates that describe the local environment around the metal(s) independently of the larger context of the macromolecular structure embedding the site(s), and are the central objects of MetalPDB design. MFSs are grouped into equistructural (broadly defined as sites found in corresponding positions in similar structures) and equivalent sites (equistructural sites that contain the same metals), allowing users to easily analyze similarities and variations in metal-macromolecule interactions, and to link them to functional information.",

Many optional fields can also be filled in that will help curators identify the reagent. After submitting an antibody, you are given a permanent identifier that can be used in publications. This identifier even if it is later found to be a duplicate, can be quickly traced back in the antibody registry.

It also provides an extensive list of visualization and analysis tools, such as heatmaps to analyze neutralization data as well as structure and sequence viewers to correlate bNAbs properties with structural and sequence features of individual antibodies. The goal of the bNAber database is to enable researchers in this field to easily compare and analyze available information on bNAbs thereby supporting efforts to design an effective vaccine for HIV/AIDS. The bNAber database not only provides easy access to data that currently is scattered in the supplementary materials sections of individual papers, but also contributes to the development of general standards of data that have to be presented with the discovery of new bNAbs and a universal mechanism of how such data can be shared.",

Their mobilization in germline - but also some somatic tissues - contributes to human genetic diversity and to diseases, such as cancer. euL1db provides a curated and comprehensive summary of L1-HS insertion polymorphisms identified in healthy or pathological human samples and published in peer-reviewed journals.

The database features three levels of annotation: manually curated, indirect and predicted. Manually curated data is extracted from the DisProt database. Indirect data is inferred from PDB structures that are considered an indication of intrinsic disorder. The 10 predictors currently included (three ESpritz flavors, two IUPred flavors, two DisEMBL flavors, GlobPlot, VSL2b and JRONN) enable MobiDB to provide disorder annotations for every protein in absence of more reliable data. The new version also features a consensus annotation and classification for long disordered regions. In order to complement the disorder annotations, MobiDB features additional annotations from external sources. Annotations from the UniProt database include post-translational modifications and linear motifs. Pfam annotations are displayed in graphical form and are link-enabled, allowing the user to visit the corresponding Pfam page for further information. Experimental protein–protein interactions are also classified for disorder content.",

  "description": "RepeatsDB (http://repeatsdb.bio.unipd.it/) is a database of annotated tandem repeat protein structures. Tandem repeats pose a difficult problem for the analysis of protein structures, as the underlying sequence can be highly degenerate. Several repeat types haven been studied over the years, but their annotation was done in a case-by-case basis, thus making large-scale analysis difficult. We developed RepeatsDB to fill this gap. Using state-of-the-art repeat detection methods and manual curation, we systematically annotated the Protein Data Bank, predicting 10 745 repeat structures. In all, 2797 structures were classified according to a recently proposed classification schema, which was expanded to accommodate new findings. In addition, detailed annotations were performed in a subset of 321 proteins. These annotations feature information on start and end positions for the repeat regions and units. RepeatsDB is an ongoing effort to systematically classify and annotate structural protein repeats in a consistent way. It provides users with the possibility to access and download high-quality datasets either interactively or programmatically through web services.",

  "description": "MoonProt Database is a manually curated, searchable, internet-based resource with information about the over 200 proteins that have been experimentally verified to be moonlighting proteins. Moonlighting proteins comprise a class of multifunctional proteins in which a single polypeptide chain performs multiple biochemical functions that are not due to gene fusions, multiple RNA splice variants or pleiotropic effects. The availability of this organized information provides a more complete picture of what is currently known about moonlighting proteins. The database will also aid researchers in other fields, including determining the functions of genes identified in genome sequencing projects, interpreting data from proteomics projects and annotating protein sequence and structural databases. In addition, information about the structures and functions of moonlighting proteins can be helpful in understanding how novel protein functional sites evolved on an ancient protein scaffold, which can also help in the design of proteins with novel functions.",

Previously considered rare, ASD are now recognized to occur in more than 1% of children, causing immense suffering to individuals and their families. The complexity and heterogeneity of ASD make it necessary to obtain large-scale samples which are difficult to attain in any individual lab. In response, the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) provides previously collected resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) datasets from 539 individuals with ASD and 573 typical controls for the purpose of data sharing in the broader scientific community. This grass-root initiative involved 16 international sites, sharing 20 samples yielding 1112 datasets composed of both MRI data and an extensive array of phenotypic information common across nearly all sites (see below). This unprecedented effort is expected to facilitate discovery science and comparisons across samples. In accordance with HIPAA guidelines and 1000 Functional Connectomes Project / INDI protocols, all datasets are anonymous, with no protected health information included.",

A huge amount of data is collected either through routine documentation forms (EHRs) for electronic health records or as case report forms (CRFs) for clinical trials. This raises major scientific challenges for health care, since different health information systems are not necessarily compatible with each other and thus information exchange of structured data is hampered.\nSoftware vendors provide a variety of individual documentation forms according to their standard contracts, which function as isolated applications. Furthermore, free availability of those forms is rarely the case. Currently less than 5 % of medical forms are freely accessible.\nBased on this lack of transparency harmonization of data models in health care is extremely cumbersome, thus work and know-how of completed clinical trials and routine documentation in hospitals are hard to be re-used.\nThe MDM-Portal serves as an infrastructure for academic (non-commercial) medical research to contribute a solution to this problem. It already contains more than 6,000 system-independent forms (CDISC ODM Format, www.cdisc.org, Operational Data Model) with more than 470,000 data-elements. This enables researchers to view, discuss, download and export forms in most common technical formats such as PDF, CSV, Excel, SQL, SPSS, R, etc. A growing user community will lead to a growing database of medical forms. In this matter, we would like to encourage all medical researchers to register and add forms and discuss existing forms.",

Links are also provided to related data stored in other thematic repositories (e.g., soil metabarcoding data) where appropriate. It was built to meet the needs of the ecosystem science, tertiary education, natural resource management industry and government sectors. AEKOS has four key services: self-service data submission (SHaRED - http://www.shared.org.au/) with DOIs for provenance, versioning and citations for uploading scientific datasets, Integrated Site Data (ISD) upload, access and intelligible reuse via its portal (http://www.aekos.org.au/) and a visualisation of TERN AusPlots plant survey data (Soils-to-Satellites - http://www.soils2satellites.org.au/). ISD upload service involves specialist ecological knowledge modelling of data that's mapped to the AEKOS ontological, 'methods description' and trait information models. Unlike self-service data submission, this service enables users to view the actual observations and measurements contained within data files - it maximises transparency. AEKOS is in the pipeline for Thomson & Reuters Data Citation Index with expected release in August 2016. There are currently 96,657 sites for mostly plants and their environmental data observed using 233,556 'plots'. Animal site data is growing with a 20-year plus ongoing desert monitoring program on plants and animals (13 sites with 25 plots) and an inventory survey of the globally unique platypus (277 sites with 2,134 plots). Regular updates for ongoing datasets occur quarterly. Responsive user support for SHaRED and AEKOS data download is available.",

The TissueNet database bridges this gap by associating experimentally-identified PPIs with human tissues that were shown to express both pair-mates. Users can select a protein and a tissue, and obtain a network view of the query protein and its tissue-associated PPIs. TissueNet v.2 is an updated version of the TissueNet database previously featured in NAR. It includes over 40 human tissues profiled via RNA-sequencing or protein-based assays. Users can select their preferred expression data source and interactively set the expression threshold for determining tissue-association. The output of TissueNet v.2 underlines qualitative and quantitative features of query proteins and their PPIs. The tissue-specificity view highlights tissue-specific and globally-expressed proteins, and the quantitative view highlights proteins that were differentially expressed in the selected tissue relative to all other tissues. Together, these views allow users to quickly assess the unique versus global functionality of query proteins. Thus, TissueNet v.2 offers an extensive, quantitative and user-friendly interface to study the roles of human proteins across tissues.",

  "description": "In 2010, Brazil published the Catalog of Plants and Fungi of Brazil and launched the first online version of the List of Species of the Brazilian Flora, meeting Target 1 of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC-CBD). This botanical milestone was only achieved due to the commitment of more than 400 Brazilians and foreign taxonomists who worked on a platform where information about our flora was included and disseminated in real time. The \"Brazilian List\", as it was popularly known, closed in November 2015 with the publication of five papers and their respective databases dealing with the different groups of fungi and plants. We enthusiastically present in 2016, the brand new system that houses the Brazilian Flora 2020 project, aiming to achieve Target 1 established for 2020 by the GSPC-CBD. This new project icludes provisions to include descriptions, identification keys and illustrations to all species of plants, algae and fungi known in the country. The Brazilian Flora 2020 project is part of the Reflora Programme and is being conducted with the support of the Sistema de Informação sobre a Biodiversidade Brasileira (SiBBr). At the moment has nearly 700 scientists working in a network to prepare the monographs. These researchers are also responsible for nomenclatural information and geographic distribution (coverage in Brazil, endemism and biomes), as well as valuable data regarding life forms, substrate and vegetation types for each species. The search results on this page include information on endangered species (thanks to the cooperation with the Centro Nacional de Conservação da Flora) and allow access to the Index Herbariorum (due to the collaboration of The New York Botanical Garden). Besides this information, users can also access images of herbarium specimens, including nomenclatural types, from both the Reflora Virtual Herbarium and INCT Virtual Herbarium of Flora and Fungi; as well as images of live plants and scientific illustrations with all images included by the experts in each group.",

Moreover, Proteome-pI facilitates statistical comparisons of the various prediction methods as well as biological investigation of protein isoelectric point space in all kingdoms of life (http://isoelectricpointdb.org/statistics.html).\nThe database includes various statistics and tools for interactive browsing, searching and sorting. It can be searched and browsed by organism name, average isoelectric point, molecular weight or amino acid frequencies. Proteins with extreme pI values are also available. For individual proteomes, users can retrieve proteins of interest given the method, isoelectric point and molecular weight ranges (this particular feature can be highly useful to limit potential targets in analysis of 2DPAGE gels or before conducting mass spectrometry). Finally, some general statistics (total number of proteins, amino acids, average sequence length, amino acid and di-amino acid frequencies) and datasets corresponding to major protein databases such as UniProtKB/TrEMBL and the NCBI non-redundant (nr) database have also been precalculated.",

The objective was to provide capacity to store and display high quality data regarding Brazil's Flora within a public institution. \nThe Reflora Virtual Herbarium is designed to allow taxonomists to perform similar procedures to the ones they are used to do within physical collections. In this site they will access, rather than physical specimens, high quality images that can be consulted, re-determined and typified, amongst other functionalities. In due course, the curators of partner institutes will receive periodic and on-demand system reports and will be able to update data in their own collections. \n There are currently (2016-10-30) 1922914 images of specimens available in the Reflora Virtual Herbarium. Amongst them, 116925 are nomenclatural types and 525348 are georeferenced records.\nIf you are a trained taxonomist and would like to collaborate in the Reflora Virtual Herbarium, contact us by e-mail at reflora@jbrj.gov.br.",

The platform is designed to support identification and prioritization of biological targets for follow-up. Each drug target is linked to a disease using integrated genome-wide data from a broad range of data sources. The platform provides either a target-centric workflow to identify diseases that may be associated with a specific target, or a disease-centric workflow to identify targets that may be associated with a specific disease. Users can easily transition between these target- and disease-centric workflows.",

  "description": "The MalaCards human disease database (http://www.malacards.org/) is an integrated compendium of annotated diseases mined from 68 data sources. MalaCards has a web card for each of ∼20 000 disease entries, in six global categories. It portrays a broad array of annotation topics in 15 sections, including Summaries, Symptoms, Anatomical Context, Drugs, Genetic Tests, Variations and Publications. The Aliases and Classifications section reflects an algorithm for disease name integration across often-conflicting sources, providing effective annotation consolidation. A central feature is a balanced Genes section, with scores reflecting the strength of disease-gene associations. This is accompanied by other gene-related disease information such as pathways, mouse phenotypes and GO-terms, stemming from MalaCards' affiliation with the GeneCards Suite of databases. MalaCards' capacity to inter-link information from complementary sources, along with its elaborate search function, relational database infrastructure and convenient data dumps, allows it to tackle its rich disease annotation landscape, and facilitates systems analyses and genome sequence interpretation. MalaCards adopts a 'flat' disease-card approach, but each card is mapped to popular hierarchical ontologies (e.g. International Classification of Diseases, Human Phenotype Ontology and Unified Medical Language System) and also contains information about multi-level relations among diseases, thereby providing an optimal tool for disease representation and scrutiny.",

Over the past four years, over 3700 users have registered to use Project Tycho data for a total of 40 creative works including peer-reviewed research papers, visualizations, online applications, and newspaper articles.\nProject Tycho 2.0 has expanded its scope to a global level and improved standardization, following FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) Data Principles where possible. Project Tycho 2.0 includes case counts for 28 additional notifiable conditions for the US and includes data for dengue-related conditions for 99 countries between 1955 and 2010, obtained from the World Health Organization and Ministries of Health. Project Tycho 2.0 datasets are represented in a standard format and include standard SNOMED-CT codes for reported conditions, ISO 3166 codes for countries and first administrative level subdivisions, and NCBI TaxonID numbers for pathogens. Metadata for Project Tycho datasets are available on the website in human-readable format, but also in machine-interpretable DATS and DataCite metadata files.",

  "description": "Flavor is an expression of olfactory and gustatory sensations experienced through a multitude of chemical processes triggered by molecules. Beyond their key role in defining taste and smell, flavor molecules also regulate metabolic processes with consequences to health. Such molecules present in natural sources have been an integral part of human history with limited success in attempts to create synthetic alternatives. Given their utility in various spheres of life such as food and fragrances, it is valuable to have a repository of flavor molecules, their natural sources, physicochemical properties, and sensory responses. FlavorDB (http://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/flavordb) comprises of 25,595 flavor molecules representing an array of tastes and odors. Among these 2254 molecules are associated with 936 natural ingredients belonging to 34 categories. The dynamic, user-friendly interface of the resource facilitates exploration of flavor molecules for divergent applications: finding molecules matching a desired flavor or structure; exploring molecules of an ingredient; discovering novel food pairings; finding the molecular essence of food ingredients; associating chemical features with a flavor and more. Data-driven studies based on FlavorDB can pave the way for an improved understanding of flavor mechanisms.",

A standardized analysis pipeline enables comparisons between multiple datasets to facilitate the exploration of protein expression across hundreds of tissues, body fluids and cell lines.\nWe recently extended the data model to enable the storage and integrated visualization of other quantitative omics data. This includes transcriptomics data from e. g. NCBI GEO, protein-protein interaction information from STRING, functional annotations from KEGG, drug-sensitivity/selectivity\ndata from several public sources and reference mass spectra from the ProteomeTools project. The extended functionality transforms ProteomicsDB into a multi-purpose resource connecting quantification and meta-data for each protein.

Sex-associated genes (SAGs), which have female-biased or male-biased expression, have major influences on the remarkable sex differences in important traits such as growth, reproduction, disease resistance and behaviors. However, the SAGs resulting in the vast majority of phenotypic sex differences are still unknown. To provide a useful resource for the functional study of SAGs, we manually curated public RNA-seq datasets with paired female and male biological replicates from the same condition and systematically re-analyzed the datasets using standardized methods. We identified 27,793 female-biased SAGs and 64,043 male-biased SAGs from 2,828 samples of 21 species, including human, chimpanzee, macaque, mouse, rat, cow, horse, chicken, zebrafish, seven fly species and five worm species. All these data were cataloged into SAGD, a user-friendly database of SAGs where users can browse SAGs by gene, species, drug, and dataset. In SAGD, the expression, annotation, targeting drugs, homologs, ontology and related RNA-seq datasets of SAGs are provided to help researchers to explore their functions and potential applications in agriculture and human health.",
