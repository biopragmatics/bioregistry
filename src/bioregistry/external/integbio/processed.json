It is also believed that chromosome 7 carries loci for a number of neuropsychiatric diseases e.g. autism, alcoholism, bipolar affective disorder, panic disorder and schizophrenia. Although it has not yet been identified, cytogenetic evidence suggests that chromosome 7 carries a gene that causes cancer.

  "description": "FLJ is a sequence analysis database that is focused on mRNA variations of human genome and cDNA sequences. There are about 20 to 25 thousand human genes and 100 thousand mRNA varieties, which are apparently caused by transcription start site (TSS) variations and splicing. \nIn the previous human cDNA project, approximately 30 thousand FLJ human full-length sequenced cDNAs were deposited in DDBJ/GenBank/EMBL, and approximately 1.4 million of 5'-end sequences (5'-EST) of FLJ full-length cDNAs from approximately 100 kinds of cDNA libraries of human tissues and cells that were constructed by the oligo-capping method were obtained. These FLJ cDNAs included approximately 80% of all human genes. In the project we developed an efficient splicing variant cDNA cloning and evaluation system, obtaining more than a thousand full-length sequenced cDNAs, which we used with the human genome to construct a sequence analysis database focused on mRNA variations.",

Models are manually curated with assigning model quality ratings based upon benchmark studies or inherited from HOCOMOCO v9.\nChIP-Seq data for motif discovery was extracted from GTRD database of BioUML platform, that also provides an interface for motif finding (sequence scanning) with HOCOMOCO models. Other sequences of TF binding DNA regions were collected from existing databases and other public data. An appropriate TFBS model was selected for each TF, with similar models selected for related TFs.\nAll TFBS models and initial binding segments data used for motif discovery were mapped to UniPROT IDs. TF coding genes are linked with GeneCards entries. DNA binding domains are linked with TF class database.",

This is achieved through the systematic and automated representation of metal-binding sites in proteins and nucleic acids by way of Minimal Functional Sites (MFSs). MFSs are three-dimensional templates that describe the local environment around the metal(s) independently of the larger context of the macromolecular structure embedding the site(s), and are the central objects of MetalPDB design. MFSs are grouped into equistructural (broadly defined as sites found in corresponding positions in similar structures) and equivalent sites (equistructural sites that contain the same metals), allowing users to easily analyze similarities and variations in metal-macromolecule interactions, and to link them to functional information.",

Many optional fields can also be filled in that will help curators identify the reagent. After submitting an antibody, you are given a permanent identifier that can be used in publications. This identifier even if it is later found to be a duplicate, can be quickly traced back in the antibody registry.

The most recent update of the database contents and features include (1) adoption of a chemical ontology for substrates of transporters, (2) inclusion of new superfamilies, (3) a domain-based characterization of transporter families (tcDoms) for the identification of new members as well as functional and evolutionary relationships between families, (4) development of novel software to facilitate curation and use of the database, (5) addition of new subclasses of transport systems including 11 novel types of channels and 3 types of group translocators, and (6) the inclusion of many man-made (artificial) transmembrane pores/channels and carriers.",

The user can interact with these species hypotheses (e.g., SH1566366.08FU) in various ways, and third-party sequence and metadata annotation are supported. Registration is needed to access the more powerful features of the accompanying PlutoF workbench. A range of search and query options are available, and precompiled reference datasets for local sequence similarity searches and HTS pipelines are available for download. Owing to the mycological roots of UNITE, two versions of the release files are available: all eukaryotes (including fungi), and fungi only.

Tandem repeats pose a difficult problem for the analysis of protein structures, as the underlying sequence can be highly degenerate. Several repeat types haven been studied over the years, but their annotation was done in a case-by-case basis, thus making large-scale analysis difficult. We developed RepeatsDB to fill this gap. Using state-of-the-art repeat detection methods and manual curation, we systematically annotated the Protein Data Bank, predicting 10 745 repeat structures. In all, 2797 structures were classified according to a recently proposed classification schema, which was expanded to accommodate new findings. In addition, detailed annotations were performed in a subset of 321 proteins. These annotations feature information on start and end positions for the repeat regions and units. RepeatsDB is an ongoing effort to systematically classify and annotate structural protein repeats in a consistent way. It provides users with the possibility to access and download high-quality datasets either interactively or programmatically through web services.",

The availability of this organized information provides a more complete picture of what is currently known about moonlighting proteins. The database will also aid researchers in other fields, including determining the functions of genes identified in genome sequencing projects, interpreting data from proteomics projects and annotating protein sequence and structural databases. In addition, information about the structures and functions of moonlighting proteins can be helpful in understanding how novel protein functional sites evolved on an ancient protein scaffold, which can also help in the design of proteins with novel functions.",

ENCODE investigators employ a variety of assays and methods to identify functional elements. The discovery and annotation of gene elements is accomplished primarily by sequencing a diverse range of RNA sources, comparative genomics, integrative bioinformatic methods, and human curation. Regulatory elements are typically investigated through DNA hypersensitivity assays, assays of DNA methylation, and immunoprecipitation (IP) of proteins that interact with DNA and RNA, i.e., modified histones, transcription factors, chromatin regulators, and RNA-binding proteins, followed by sequencing.",

  "description": "The e-Mouse Atlas (EMA) is a detailed model of the developing mouse. Its purpose is not only to provide information about the shape, gross anatomy and detailed histological structure of the mouse, but also to provide a framework into which information about gene function can be mapped. The spatial, temporal and anatomical integration achieved by mapping diverse data to the organism itself rather than simply to database tables, allows powerful computational analyses. The website presents 3D volumetric models of the embryo linked, in most cases, to comprehensive and detailed images of histological structure. The embryo models and anatomy in EMA are organized by standard developmental stage (TS. after Theiler, 1989) and age of the embryo in days post coitum (dpc.). Gene-expression and other image data is also available.",

A huge amount of data is collected either through routine documentation forms (EHRs) for electronic health records or as case report forms (CRFs) for clinical trials. This raises major scientific challenges for health care, since different health information systems are not necessarily compatible with each other and thus information exchange of structured data is hampered. Software vendors provide a variety of individual documentation forms according to their standard contracts, which function as isolated applications. Furthermore, free availability of those forms is rarely the case. Currently less than 5 % of medical forms are freely accessible. Based on this lack of transparency harmonization of data models in health care is extremely cumbersome, thus work and know-how of completed clinical trials and routine documentation in hospitals are hard to be re-used. The MDM-Portal serves as an infrastructure for academic (non-commercial) medical research to contribute a solution to this problem. It already contains more than 6,000 system-independent forms (CDISC ODM Format, www.cdisc.org, Operational Data Model) with more than 470,000 data-elements. This enables researchers to view, discuss, download and export forms in most common technical formats such as PDF, CSV, Excel, SQL, SPSS, R, etc. A growing user community will lead to a growing database of medical forms. In this matter, we would like to encourage all medical researchers to register and add forms and discuss existing forms.",

ORA-Data is an extra function of ORA which is aimed at University of Oxford researchers who have either deposited data at external archives and want a centralised record of this, or who need a repository to deposit research data. Using the service will prevent loss of data and increase the impact of your research. It provides permanent links between publications and underlying data, and can be used as a repository for secure, long-term preservation of raw data and associated documentation. It helps Oxford researchers fulfil funding bodies' requirements to take active steps in preserving data and documentation. Digital object identifiers (DOIs) are assigned to each item in the resource for citation and attribution. Even though only Oxford researchers can upload their data in ORA, the search facility is publicly accessible.",

However, many protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have no tissue-contexts. The TissueNet database bridges this gap by associating experimentally-identified PPIs with human tissues that were shown to express both pair-mates. Users can select a protein and a tissue, and obtain a network view of the query protein and its tissue-associated PPIs. TissueNet v.2 is an updated version of the TissueNet database previously featured in NAR. It includes over 40 human tissues profiled via RNA-sequencing or protein-based assays. Users can select their preferred expression data source and interactively set the expression threshold for determining tissue-association. The output of TissueNet v.2 underlines qualitative and quantitative features of query proteins and their PPIs. The tissue-specificity view highlights tissue-specific and globally-expressed proteins, and the quantitative view highlights proteins that were differentially expressed in the selected tissue relative to all other tissues. Together, these views allow users to quickly assess the unique versus global functionality of query proteins. Thus, TissueNet v.2 offers an extensive, quantitative and user-friendly interface to study the roles of human proteins across tissues.",

  "description": "In 2010, Brazil published the Catalog of Plants and Fungi of Brazil and launched the first online version of the List of Species of the Brazilian Flora, meeting Target 1 of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC-CBD). This botanical milestone was only achieved due to the commitment of more than 400 Brazilians and foreign taxonomists who worked on a platform where information about our flora was included and disseminated in real time. The \"Brazilian List\", as it was popularly known, closed in November 2015 with the publication of five papers and their respective databases dealing with the different groups of fungi and plants. We enthusiastically present in 2016, the brand new system that houses the Brazilian Flora 2020 project, aiming to achieve Target 1 established for 2020 by the GSPC-CBD. This new project icludes provisions to include descriptions, identification keys and illustrations to all species of plants, algae and fungi known in the country. The Brazilian Flora 2020 project is part of the Reflora Programme and is being conducted with the support of the Sistema de Informação sobre a Biodiversidade Brasileira (SiBBr). At the moment has nearly 700 scientists working in a network to prepare the monographs. These researchers are also responsible for nomenclatural information and geographic distribution (coverage in Brazil, endemism and biomes), as well as valuable data regarding life forms, substrate and vegetation types for each species. The search results on this page include information on endangered species (thanks to the cooperation with the Centro Nacional de Conservação da Flora) and allow access to the Index Herbariorum (due to the collaboration of The New York Botanical Garden). Besides this information, users can also access images of herbarium specimens, including nomenclatural types, from both the Reflora Virtual Herbarium and INCT Virtual Herbarium of Flora and Fungi; as well as images of live plants and scientific illustrations with all images included by the experts in each group.",

The isoelectric point, the pH at which a particular molecule carries no net electrical charge, is an important parameter for many analytical biochemistry and proteomics techniques, especially for 2D gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), capillary isoelectric focusing, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and X-ray protein crystallography. The database allows the retrieval of virtual 2D-PAGE plots and the development of customized fractions of proteome based on isoelectric point and molecular weight. Moreover, Proteome-pI facilitates statistical comparisons of the various prediction methods as well as biological investigation of protein isoelectric point space in all kingdoms of life (http://isoelectricpointdb.org/statistics.html). The database includes various statistics and tools for interactive browsing, searching and sorting. It can be searched and browsed by organism name, average isoelectric point, molecular weight or amino acid frequencies. Proteins with extreme pI values are also available. For individual proteomes, users can retrieve proteins of interest given the method, isoelectric point and molecular weight ranges (this particular feature can be highly useful to limit potential targets in analysis of 2DPAGE gels or before conducting mass spectrometry). Finally, some general statistics (total number of proteins, amino acids, average sequence length, amino acid and di-amino acid frequencies) and datasets corresponding to major protein databases such as UniProtKB/TrEMBL and the NCBI non-redundant (nr) database have also been precalculated.",

  "description": "The MalaCards human disease database (http://www. malacards.org/) is an integrated compendium of annotated diseases mined from 68 data sources. MalaCards has a web card for each of ∼20 000 disease entries, in six global categories. It portrays a broad array of annotation topics in 15 sections, including Summaries, Symptoms, Anatomical Context, Drugs, Genetic Tests, Variations and Publications. The Aliases and Classifications section reflects an algorithm for disease name integration across often-conflicting sources, providing effective annotation consolidation. A central feature is a balanced Genes section, with scores reflecting the strength of disease-gene associations. This is accompanied by other gene-related disease information such as pathways, mouse phenotypes and GO-terms, stemming from MalaCards’ affiliation with the GeneCards Suite of databases. MalaCards’ capacity to inter-link information from complementary sources, along with its elaborate search function, relational database infrastructure and convenient data dumps, allows it to tackle its rich disease annotation landscape, and facilitates systems analyses and genome sequence interpretation. MalaCards adopts a ‘flat’ disease-card approach, but each card is mapped to popular hierarchical ontologies (e.g. International Classification of Diseases, Human Phenotype Ontology and Unified Medical Language System) and also contains information about multi-level relations among diseases, thereby providing an optimal tool for disease representation and scrutiny.",

  "description": "MorphoBank provides a digital archive of biodiversity and evolutionary research data, specifically systematics (the science of determining the evolutionary relationships among species). MorphoBank aids development of the Tree of Life - the genealogy of all living and extinct species. Heritable features - both genotypes (e.g., DNA sequences) and phenotypes (e.g., anatomy, behavior, physiology) are stored as part of the Tree of Life project. While the genomic part of this work is archived at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), MorphoBank is part of the infrastructure for storing and sharing phenotype data, including information on anatomy, physiology, behavior and other features of species. One can think of MorphoBank as two databases in one: one that permits researchers to upload images and affiliate data with those images (labels, species names, etc.) and a second database that allows researchers to upload morphological data and affiliate it with phylogenetic matrices. In both cases, MorphoBank is project-based, meaning a team of researchers can create a project and share the images and associated data exclusively with each other. When a paper associated with the project is published, the research team can make their data permanently available for view on MorphoBank where it is now archived. The phylogenetic matrix aspect of MorphoBank is designed to aid systematists working alone or in teams to build large phylogenetic trees using morphology (anatomy, histology, neurology, or any aspect of phenotypes) or a combination of morphology and molecular data.",

The participation to field expeditions in the Antarctic and Arctic has enabled to collect samples in many locations. Moreover, taxonomic research is carried out by the host Unit to improve the classification of the cyanobacterial phylum. It is based on a polyphasic approach combining the morphological and molecular characterizations of the strains.",

Beyond their key role in defining taste and smell, flavor molecules also regulate metabolic processes with consequences to health. Such molecules present in natural sources have been an integral part of human history with limited success in attempts to create synthetic alternatives. Given their utility in various spheres of life such as food and fragrances, it is valuable to have a repository of flavor molecules, their natural sources, physicochemical properties, and sensory responses. FlavorDB (http://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/flavordb) comprises of 25,595 flavor molecules representing an array of tastes and odors. Among these 2254 molecules are associated with 936 natural ingredients belonging to 34 categories. The dynamic, user-friendly interface of the resource facilitates exploration of flavor molecules for divergent applications: finding molecules matching a desired flavor or structure; exploring molecules of an ingredient; discovering novel food pairings; finding the molecular essence of food ingredients; associating chemical features with a flavor and more.

A standardized analysis pipeline enables comparisons between multiple datasets to facilitate the exploration of protein expression across hundreds of tissues, body fluids and cell lines. We recently extended the data model to enable the storage and integrated visualization of other quantitative omics data. This includes transcriptomics data from e. g. NCBI GEO, protein-protein interaction information from STRING, functional annotations from KEGG, drug-sensitivity/selectivity data from several public sources and reference mass spectra from the ProteomeTools project. The extended functionality transforms ProteomicsDB into a multi-purpose resource connecting quantification and meta-data for each protein. The rich user interface helps researchers to navigate all data sources in either a protein-centric or multi-protein-centric manner.

Sex-associated genes (SAGs), which have female-biased or male-biased expression, have major influences on the remarkable sex differences in important traits such as growth, reproduction, disease resistance and behaviors. However, the SAGs resulting in the vast majority of phenotypic sex differences are still unknown. To provide a useful resource for the functional study of SAGs, we manually curated public RNA-seq datasets with paired female and male biological replicates from the same condition and systematically re-analyzed the datasets using standardized methods. We identified 27,793 female-biased SAGs and 64,043 male-biased SAGs from 2,828 samples of 21 species, including human, chimpanzee, macaque, mouse, rat, cow, horse, chicken, zebrafish, seven fly species and five worm species. All these data were cataloged into SAGD, a user-friendly database of SAGs where users can browse SAGs by gene, species, drug, and dataset. In SAGD, the expression, annotation, targeting drugs, homologs, ontology and related RNA-seq datasets of SAGs are provided to help researchers to explore their functions and potential applications in agriculture and human health.",
