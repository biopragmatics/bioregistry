These data elements would be classified by HL7 as “observations”. The taxonomy is  multi-axial. It consists of 12 domains and 36 classes. All domains and classes are defined. There are 7 axes with definitions for each. Each nursing diagnosis consists of: a concept label or term expressed as a noun or a noun phrase; a definition of the term; a set of defining characteristics (signs and symptoms) of the diagnostic term; an approved list of modifiers of the term; a set of risk factors with definitions; and a set of related factors (or etiologies) for the term.  The system preserves semantics by having robust review procedures and policies to ensure against semantic drift in the meanings of the encoded terms over time. NANDA as an organization is committed to updating the terminology on a regular biannual basis. 	NANDA has been in existence since 1973 and is thus the oldest developer of standardized language in nursing. Most other nursing language systems use many of the older NANDA terms in their vocabularies. The express purpose of the organization is to develop a comprehensive standardized nursing language that captures the conclusions that nurses make based on observations – in effect, the nursing diagnoses. The work is a continuing effort and diagnoses are revised, retired or added bi-annually. The codes are simple integers and are not linked to each other. If a diagnostic term is retired, the code is also retired. If a new diagnosis is added a new code is given to that term. If a diagnostic term is revised, the code is kept intact but the date of the revision is published alongside the term.

The CCC System consists of two interrelated terminologies: CCC of 176 Nursing Diagnoses( which includes 528 CCC Nursing Outcomes from each nursing diagnoses combined with one of three qualifiers (Improved, stanbilized, or deteriorated) to document the expected or actual outcomes). The second terminology is the CCC of 804 Nursing Interventions which represents 201 Core Nursing Interventions each of which has to be combined with one of four Action Type Qualifiers (Assess/Monitor; Perform/Care. Teach/Instruct, or Manage/Refer).  Both of the terminologies are classified by 21 Care Components to form a single system.  The CCC System consists of a four level structure designed to document nursing practice following the six steps of the nursing process as recommended by the American Nurses Assocation (ANA) as professional nursing practice and for documenting the 'essence of care'. The ANA recognized the CCC System as early as 1992 and was one of the four earliest nursing terminologies designed to document nursing practice electronically in any healthcare setting where nurses function e.g. hospitals, outpatient departments, home health agencies, ambulatory care clinics, and other health care settings. The CCC System was the first nursing terminology to be recognized by the Secretary of HHS as interoperable and usable for documenting in the electronic health record systems. It is available as a free terminology with Permission -- fomr found on its web Site.

It was derived from our knowledge of ICPC, ICD-10, and our aggregate 60-year clinical family medicine experience. Development occurred over a period of approximately ten years and was initially presented internationally at the Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care (SCAMC) 1991 under its original name SIN-FM. The product was subsequently enhanced in order to be the standard terminology for the national database of the College of Family Physicians of Canada ""Clinical Practice Management Network"".ENCODE-FM has been designed expressly for use at point of service in primary care. It addresses the issues of ease of data entry and accuracy of aggregate data retrieval in its design, the mapping to other classifications, and choice of words and terms. Published research (use links)(J. Amer. Medical Informatics Assoc. 3(3): 224-233, 1996; J. Amer. Medical Informatics Assoc., Symposium Supplement 1995, Vol 20: 135-139. 1996.) has shown that none of the large nomenclatures (each over 100,000 terms) intended to cover the whole health care system, describe all clinical content or even all diseases. Alternatively, ENCODE-FM was designed to do one part of that task well - namely to be a CLINICAL terminology of ONLY symptoms, complaints, diagnoses, disorders and reasons for encounter for use in primary care electronic records. It is intended to facilitate data entry by the caregiver, and to allow data aggregation by the 3 internationally recognized classifications of disease used most commonly in primary care  ICPC, ICD-10, and ICD09CM.It was also designed to be an evolving terminology, so that as the terminology and usage of medical terms changes, ENCODE can be readily updated with the changes. ENCODE-FM currently contains 9378 terms.http://www.insite-fm.com/Products/ENCODE-FM",2006/03/25 12:00:00,2009/12/28 12:00:00,2009/12/28 06:47:12,,UV

All approved symbols are stored in the HGNC database.  Each symbol is unique and each gene is only given one approved gene symbol.  More than 28,000 human gene symbols and names have been approved so far.  The vast majority of these is for protein-coding genes, but also includes symbols for peudogenes, non-coding RNAs, phenotypes and genomic features.

Efficient data entry - RxTerms separates the full names in RxNorm into two parts: drug name + route (e.g. INDERAL (Oral-pill)) and strength + dose form (e.g. 80 MG Tabs) to avoid big picklists with excessively long names. It excludes drugs from RxNorm that are obsolete or unavailable in the U.S.""	User-friendly features - commonly used synonyms and abbreviations (e.g. HCTZ for hydrochlorothiazide), ""tall man"" lettering recommended by FDA to avoid medication errors (e.g. ChlorproMAZINE and ChlorproPAMIDE).""	Good coverage - retains the broad coverage of RxNorm for U.S. prescribable drugs - 99% coverage of both generic and brand names of U.S. most commonly prescribed drugs. RxTerms is tailored for U.S. prescribing and it might not be the right choice for many non-U.S. countries.RxNorm is the designated US Federal drug terminology standard.

The NUBC was formed to develop a single billing form and standard data set that could be used nationwide by institutional providers and payers for handling health care claims, the current UB-04 manual.In determining the data to be included, the NUBC strives to balance the need for the information against the burden of providing that information. In essence it applies the administrative simplification principles mentioned in the recently enacted Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Data elements identified as necessary for claims processing are, in most cases, assigned designated spaces on the form. The designated spaces are referred to as Form Locators and each one has a unique number. The current UB-04 data specifications manual seeks to identify the national requirements for preparing Medicare, Medicaid, OCHAMPUS, BCBS, and commercial insurance claims.

In contrast to the inpatient setting, outpatient prescribing must be specific as to dosage form and strength. Attributes of the MEDID provide drug information and access to clinical and patient education modules within NDDF Plus.The fdbMEDID is the primary clinical drug concept distributed by FDB that is used to represent the clinical drug when prescribing, ordering or when generating a list of active patient medications.

Secondly, the fdbMedNameID may be used within proprietary allergy or drug-sensitivity documentation applications in the context of a medication ""allergen.""  For example,the term ""Bactrim"" (fdb MedNameID = 5086) may be selected as a patient medication allergen.  When screening prospective medications for potential allergies, ingredients associated to the fdb MedNameID are fetched in support of allergy detection algorithms.  In the case of ""Bactrim,"" the ingredients ""trimethoprim"" and ""sulfamethoxazole"" would be fetched as related ingredient allergens.For interoperable medication allergen exchange, branded fdbMedNameID values will be cross-referenced to RxNorm Brand Names (example, ""Bactrim"" = RXCUI 151399, Terminology Type = BN); generically named fdbMedNameID values will be linked to RxNorm ingredients (e.g., Ingredient [IN], Precise Ingrdient [PIN] or Multiple Ingredient {MIN]). In the context of HL7, the fdbMedNameID would most likely be used when compiling a structured medication allergen within the Allergy Observation for a CDA document.

CMS released the proposed OPPS rules using the Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC) system in the September 8, 1998 Federal Register. Final regulations were published in the April 7, 2000 Federal Register and the system became effective for Medicare on August 1, 2000.The APC-based OPPS developed by CMS is the outpatient equivalent of the inpatient, DRG-based PPS. The APC system establishes groups of covered services so that the services within each group are comparable clinically and with respect to the use of resources.Hospitals are required to use HCPCS when billing for outpatient services.The OCE not only identifies individual errors but also indicates what actions should be taken and the reasons why these actions are necessary. In order to accommodate this functionality, the OCE is structured to return lists of edit numbers. This structure facilitates the linkage between the actions being taken, the reasons for the actions and the information on the claim (e.g., a specific diagnosis) that caused the action. In general, the OCE performs all functions that require specific reference to HCPCS codes, HCPCS modifiers and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes (ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for historical claims with From Dates prior to 10/1/2015). Since these coding systems are complex and annually updated, the centralization of the direct reference to these codes and modifiers in a single program reduces effort and reduces the chance of inconsistent processing.This is a CMS maintained list of edits: Please see the following for additional information: &#8226;	https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/OutpatientCodeEdit/index.html&#8226;	https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/OutpatientCodeEdit/Background.htmlC&#8226;	https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/OutpatientCodeEdit/OCEQtrReleaseSpecs.htmlThese fields are used in grouping and reimbursement for CMS APCs.

HLA alleles are most commonly used for histocompatibility testing for stem cell and solid organ transplantation. The WHO Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA System is responsible for a common nomenclature of HLA alleles, allele sequences, and quality control, to communicate histocompatibility typing information to match donors and recipients.  For the full specification, please go to this website: http://hla.alleles.org/nomenclature/naming.html .HLA nomenclature can also be used to represent sets of alleles that share sequence identity in the Antigen Recognition Site (ARS).  G-groups are alleles that have identical DNA sequences in the ARS, while P-groups are alleles that have identical protein sequences in the ARS.

A star allele can identify either a single variant or a group of variants found in cis, and therefore it usually represents a haplotype. A star allele name is composed of the gene symbol and an allele number, separated by an asterisk, e.g. TPMT*2. By convention, the *1 allele represents the allele that contains the ""reference"" sequence, although that is not true in all cases.  Closely related alleles may be assigned a common number and be differentiated by a unique letter that specifies the suballele (e.g., TPMT*3A, TPMT*3B).
