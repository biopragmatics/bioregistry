It has been online since the beginning of 2012 and since mid-2014 replaces the spoken German database, which was developed in the \"Deutsches Spracharchiv (DSAv)\" of the IDS.\nAfter single registration, the DGD offers external users a web-based access to selected parts of the collection of the  \"Archive Spoken German (AGD)\" for use in research and teaching. The selection of the data for external use depends on the consent of the respective data provider, who in turn must have the appropriate usage and exploitation rights. Also relevant to the selection are certain protection needs of the archive.\nThe Archive for Spoken German (AGD) collects and archives data of spoken German in interactions (conversation corpora) and data of domestic and non-domestic varieties of German (variation corpora). Currently, the AGD hosts around 50 corpora comprising more than 15000 audio and 500 video recordings amounting to around 5000 hours of recorded material with more than 7000 transcripts. With the Research and Teaching Corpus of Spoken German (FOLK) the AGD is also compiling an extensive German conversation corpus of its own.\n!!!

Over the past 30 years the CADC has evolved from an archiving centre---hosting data from Hubble Space Telescope, Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, the Gemini observatories, and the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope---into a Science Platform for data-intensive astronomy. The CADC, in partnership with Shared Services Canada, Compute Canada, CANARIE and the university community (funded through the Canadian Foundation for Innovation), offers cloud computing, user-managed storage, group management, and data publication services, in addition to its ongoing mission to provide permanent storage for major data collections.\nLocated at NRC Herzberg Astronomy and Astrophysics Research Centre in Victoria, BC, the CADC staff consists of professional astronomers, software developers, and operations staff who work with the community to develop and deliver leading-edge services to advance Canadian research. The CADC plays a leading role in international efforts to improve the scientific/technical landscape that supports data intensive science. This includes leadership roles in the International Virtual Observatory Alliance and participation in organizations like the Research Data Alliance, CODATA, and the World Data Systems. CADC also contributes significantly to future Canadian projects like the Square Kilometre Array and TMT. \nIn 2019, the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC) delivered over 2 Petabytes of data (over 200 million individual files) to thousands of astronomers in Canada and in over 80 other countries. The cloud processing system completed over 6 million jobs (over 1100 core years) in 2019.",

GISAID calls on all users to agree to the basic premise of upholding scientific etiquette, by acknowledging the originating laboratories providing the specimen and the submitting laboratories who generate the sequence data, ensuring fair exploitation of results derived from the data, and that all users agree that no restrictions shall be attached to data submitted to GISAID, to promote collaboration among researchers on the basis of open sharing of data and respect for all rights and interests.",

Both microarray and RNA-seq experiments are included in the Differential Atlas.

Ensembl is a joint project between the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI) to develop a software system that produces and maintains automatic annotation on selected genomes.The Ensembl project was started in 1999, some years before the draft human genome was completed. Even at that early stage it was clear that manual annotation of 3 billion base pairs of sequence would not be able to offer researchers timely access to the latest data. The goal of Ensembl was therefore to automatically annotate the genome, integrate this annotation with other available biological data and make all this publicly available via the web. Since the website's launch in July 2000, many more genomes have been added to Ensembl and the range of available data has also expanded to include comparative genomics, variation and regulatory data. Ensembl is a joint project between European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), an outstation of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI). Both institutes are located on the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus in Hinxton, south of the city of Cambridge, United Kingdom.",

    "description": "The WDC has a FTP-server to distribute the PCN index derived from the geomagnetic observatory Qaanaaq (THL) and the Kp-index data products derived at the geomagnetic observatory Niemegk (NGK).\nThe WDC is also holding extensive archives of magnetograms and other geomagnetic observatory data products that predate the introduction of digital data recording. The material is in analogue form such as film or microfiche.  \nThe Polar Cap index (abbreviation PC index) consists of the Polar Cap North (PCN) and the Polar Cap South (PCS) index, which are derived from magnetic measurements taken at the geomagnetic observatories Qaanaaq (THL, Greenland, +85o magnetic latitude) and Vostok (VOS, Antarctica, -83o magnetic latitude), respectively.\nThe idea behind these indices is to estimate the intensity of anti-sunward plasma convection in the polar caps. This convection is associated with electric Hall currents and consequent magnetic field variations perpendicular to the antisunward plasma flow (and related Hall current) which can be monitored at the Qaanaaq and Vostok magnetic observatories.\nPC aims at monitoring the energy input from solar wind to the magnetosphere (loading activity). The index is constructed in such a way that it has a linear relationship with the merging Electric Field at the magnetopause; consequently PC is given in units of mV/m as for the electric field.\nIn August 2013, the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA) endorsed the PC index. The endorsed PC index is accessible at pcindex.org or through WDC Copenhagen.",

The electronic full-texts are indexed linguistically and the search facilities tolerate a range of spelling variants. The DTA presents German-language printed works from around 1650 to 1900 as full text and as digital facsimile. The selection of texts was made on the basis of lexicographical criteria and includes scientific or scholarly texts, texts from everyday life, and literary works. The digitalisation was made from the first edition of each work. Using the digital images of these editions, the text was first typed up manually twice (‘double keying’). To represent the structure of the text, the electronic full-text was encoded in conformity with the XML standard TEI P5. The next stages complete the linguistic analysis, i.e. the text is tokenised, lemmatised, and the parts of speech are annotated. The DTA thus presents a linguistically analysed, historical full-text corpus, available for a range of questions in corpus linguistics. Thanks to the interdisciplinary nature of the DTA Corpus, it also offers valuable source-texts for neighbouring disciplines in the humanities, and for scientists, legal scholars and economists.",

The methodology - i.e. the sample design, the principles on operationalization and measurement, and data-collection techniques - is largely modelled on the tried-and-tested methods of empirical social research. Health interview surveys (HIS) use established survey techniques such as filling out questionnaires, computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI), computer-assisted personal interviews (CAPI), and online polling via the internet or email. The main difference compared to purely sociological surveys lies in the additional biomedical examinations, tests and medical-biochemical measurements, which generate significant added value in addition to the results of the surveys; this part is referred to internationally as the health examination survey (HES).",

    "description": "The Argo observational network consists of a fleet of 3000+ profiling autonomous floats deployed by about a dozen teams worldwide. WHOI has built about 10% of the global fleet. The mission lifetime of each float is about 4 years. During a typical mission, each float reports a profile of the upper ocean every 10 days. The sensors onboard record fundamental physical properties of the ocean: temperature and conductivity (a measure of salinity) as a function of pressure. The depth range of the observed profile depends on the local stratification and the float's mechanical ability to adjust it's buoyancy. The majority of Argo floats report profiles between 1-2 km depth. At each surfacing, measurements of temperature and salinity are relayed back to shore via satellite. Telemetry is usually received every 10 days, but floats at high-latitudes which are iced-over accumulate their data and transmit the entire record the next time satellite contact is established. With current battery technology, the best performing floats last 6+ years and record over 200 profiles.",

We redesigned the data format to be more concise, allowing consistent representations among data entries compared with the original REFOLD database. The remodeled data architecture enhances the search efficiency and improves the sustainability of the database.

Solar wind characteristics are highly variable, and they have actually a direct influence on the shape and size of the magnetosphere, on the amount of transferred energy, and on the way this energy is dissipated. It is clear that the great diversity of sources of magnetic variations give rise to a great complexity in ground magnetic signatures.\nGeomagnetic indices aim at describing the geomagnetic activity or some of its components. Each geomagnetic index is related to different phenomena occurring in the magnetosphere, ionosphere and deep in the Earth in its own unique way. The location of a measurement, the timing of the measurement and the way the index is calculated all affect the type of phenomenon the index relates to.\nThe IAGA endorsed geomagnetic indices and lists of remarkable geomagnetic events constitute unique temporal and spatial coverage data series homogeneous since middle of 19th century.",

Density waves in the interstellar medium, its role in star formation, the giant planets, asteroids, and comets of the solar system are among the objects of investigation.\nISO was operated as an observatory with the majority of its observing time being distributed to the general astronomical community. One of the consequences of this is that the data set is not homogeneous, as would be expected from a survey. The observational data underwent sophisticated data processing, including validation and accuracy analysis. In total, the ISO Data Archive contains about 30,000 standard observations, 120,000 parallel, serendipity and calibration observations and 17,000 engineering measurements. In addition to the observational data products, the archive also contains satellite data, documentation, data of historic aspects and externally derived products, for a total of more than 400 GBytes stored on magnetic disks.

Multi-channel data are primarily from the marine seismic vessels operated by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University. Modern single channel seismic data from other vessels including the R/V Palmer and USCG Healy, as well as data from portable seismic systems, are also served. \nThe development of the Academic Seismic Portal has focused on the need to recover high value MCS data from older surveys as well as to establish sustainable procedures for preservation of data from modern programs. During the final two years of R/V Ewing operations, procedures were established for routine transfer of MCS data along with navigation and acquisition parameters, and other needed documentation to the ASP. Transfer of seismic data and acquisition information is now routine for the National Marine Seismic Facility, the R/V Marcus G. Langseth, which began science operations in February 2008. Data are documented and incorporated into the data system with full access restrictions protecting the scientists' rights to exclusive access during the proprietary hold period. Submission of data to the ASP helps ensure that NSF requirements for data sharing as outlined in the NSF OCE Data Policy are satisfied.\nData from the Academic Seismic Portal at UTIG has been migrated to LDEO.

    "description": "When published in 2005, the Millennium Run was the largest ever simulation of the formation of structure within the ΛCDM cosmology. It uses 10(10) particles to follow the dark matter distribution in a cubic region 500h(−1)Mpc on a side, and has a spatial resolution of 5h−1kpc. Application of simplified modelling techniques to the stored output of this calculation allows the formation and evolution of the ~10(7) galaxies more luminous than the Small Magellanic Cloud to be simulated for a variety of assumptions about the detailed physics involved. As part of the activities of the German Astrophysical Virtual Observatory we have created relational databases to store the detailed assembly histories both of all the haloes and subhaloes resolved by the simulation, and of all the galaxies that form within these structures for two independent models of the galaxy formation physics. We have implemented a Structured Query Language (SQL) server on these databases. This allows easy access to many properties of the galaxies and halos, as well as to the spatial and temporal relations between them. Information is output in table format compatible with standard Virtual Observatory tools. With this announcement (from 1/8/2006) we are making these structures fully accessible to all users. Interested scientists can learn SQL and test queries on a small, openly accessible version of the Millennium Run (with volume 1/512 that of the full simulation). They can then request accounts to run similar queries on the databases for the full simulations. In 2008 and 2012 the simulations were repeated.",

    "description": "dbEST is a division of GenBank that contains sequence data and other information on \"single-pass\" cDNA sequences, or \"Expressed Sequence Tags\", from a number of organisms.  Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) are short (usually about 300-500 bp), single-pass sequence reads from mRNA (cDNA). Typically they are produced in large batches. They represent a snapshot of genes expressed in a given tissue and/or at a given developmental stage. They are tags (some coding, others not) of expression for a given cDNA library.\nMost EST projects develop large numbers of sequences. These are commonly submitted to GenBank and dbEST as batches of dozens to thousands of entries, with a great deal of redundancy in the citation, submitter and library information. To improve the efficiency of the submission process for this type of data, we have designed a special streamlined submission process and data format.\ndbEST also includes sequences that are longer than the traditional ESTs, or are produced as single sequences or in small batches. Among these sequences are products of differential display experiments and RACE experiments. The thing that these sequences have in common with traditional ESTs, regardless of length, quality, or quantity, is that there is little information that can be annotated in the record.\nIf a sequence is later characterized and annotated with biological features such as a coding region, 5'UTR, or 3'UTR, it should be submitted through the regular GenBank submissions procedure (via BankIt or Sequin), even if part of the sequence is already in dbEST.\ndbEST is reserved for single-pass reads. Assembled sequences should not be submitted to dbEST. GenBank will accept assembled EST submissions for the forthcoming TSA (Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly) division.  The individual reads which make up the assembly should be submitted to dbEST, the Trace archive or the Short Read Archive (SRA) prior to the submission of the assemblies.",

It aims at co-ordinating these developments and facilitating access to this data for research purposes.\nThe first working target, is the implementation of the TNG Long-Term Archive (LTA). Its feasibility was demonstrated by the LTA pilot project prototype, funded by CNAA in 2001 and completed successfully in July 2002. The implementation of the TNG archive implies:\n− interfacing with the Centro \"Galileo Galilei\" (CGG) for the acquisition of TNG data;\n− long-term storage of scientific, technical and auxiliary data from the TNG;\n− providing accessibility by the CGG staff and by the scientific community to original and derived data;\n− providing tools to support the life cycle of observing proposals.\nThe second target of the proposal aims at ensuring harmonization with other projects related to archiving of data of astrophysical interest, with particular reference to projects involving the Italian astronomical community (LBT, VST, GSC-II, DPOSS, …), to the Italian Solar and Solar System Physics community (SOLAR, SOLRA, ARTHEMIS which form SOLARNET – a future node of EGSO) and to the national and international coordination efforts fostering the idea of a multiwavelength Virtual Astronomical Observatory, and the use of the archived data through the Italian Astronomical Grid.",

By covering the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the Earth, TRMM provides much needed information on rainfall and its associated heat release that helps to power the global atmospheric circulation that shapes both weather and climate. In coordination with other satellites in NASA's Earth Observing System, TRMM provides important precipitation information using several space-borne instruments to increase our understanding of the interactions between water vapor, clouds, and precipitation, that are central to regulating Earth's climate.\nThe TRMM mission ended in 2015 and final TRMM multi-satellite precipitation analyses (TMPA, product 3B42/3B43) data processing will end December 31st, 2019. As a result, this TRMM webpage is in the process of being retired and some TRMM imagery may not be displaying correctly.

Lastly, to aid in feature identification, a companion image containing feature annotation has been included. The symbols on the annotated overlays, however, should only be used as locators and not for precise measurements. More detailed information about the digital archive process can be read in abstracts presented at the 30th and 31st Lunar and Planetary Science Conferences.",

This is accomplished by combining high-throughput generation of affinity-purified antibodies with protein profiling in a multitude of tissues and cells assembled in tissue microarrays. Confocal microscopy analysis using human cell lines is performed for more detailed protein localization. The program hosts the Human Protein Atlas portal with expression profiles of human proteins in tissues and cells.  The main objective of the resource centre is to produce specific antibodies to human target proteins using a high-throughput production method involving the cloning and protein expression of Protein Epitope Signature Tags (PrESTs). After purification, the antibodies are used to study expression profiles in cells and tissues and for functional analysis of the corresponding proteins in a wide range of platforms.",

It processes these data and provides users with reliable and up-to-date information through a set of services related to environmental and security issues. The services address six thematic areas: land monitoring, marine monitoring, atmosphere monitoring, climate change, emergency management and security.\nThe main users of Copernicus services are policymakers and public authorities who need the information to develop environmental legislation and policies or to take critical decisions in the event of an emergency, such as a natural disaster or a humanitarian crisis.\nBased on the Copernicus services and on the data collected through the Sentinels and the contributing missions , many value-added services can be tailored to specific public or commercial needs, resulting in new business opportunities. In fact, several economic studies have already demonstrated a huge potential for job creation, innovation and growth.",

Biota is a hierarchical system with species grouped in genera, genera in families, families in orders and so on up to kingdoms and superkingdoms.

We engage in linguistic and interdisciplinary research projects ourselves; offer linguistic research capabilities for undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and visitors; and build relationships with the linguistic communities in which we do our research.\nWe are interested in a broad range of issues pertaining to syntax, interfaces, and cross-linguistic variation. We place a particular emphasis on novel experimental evidence that facilitates the construction of linguistic theory. We have a strong cross-linguistic focus, drawing upon English, Russian, Chinese, Korean, Mayan languages, Basque, Austronesian languages, languages of the Caucasus, and others. We believe that challenging existing theories with data from as broad a range of languages as possible is a crucial component of the successful development of linguistic theory.\nWe investigate both fluent speakers and heritage speakers—those who grew up hearing or speaking a particular language but who are now more fluent in a different, societally dominant language. Heritage languages, a novel field of linguistic inquiry, are important because they provide new insights into processes of linguistic development and attrition in general, thus increasing our understanding of the human capacity to maintain and acquire language. Understanding language use and processing in real time and how children acquire language helps us improve language study and pedagogy, which in turn improves communication across the globe. Although our lab does not specialize in language acquisition, we have conducted some studies of acquisition of lesser-studied languages and heritage languages, with the purpose of comparing heritage speakers to adults.",

The original database https://www.fruitfly.org/index.html reproduced functions available on FlyBase, complicating our updates by the requirement to re-synchronize with FlyBase updates. Our expression reports on the new site still link to FlyBase gene reports, but we no longer reproduce FlyBase functions and therefore can update expression data on an ongoing basis instead of more infrequent major releases. All the functions relating to the expression patterns remain and we soon will add an option to search expression patterns by image similarity, in addition to annotation term searches. In a transitional phase we will leave both the old and the new sites up, but the newer data (post Release 2) will appear only on the new website. We welcome any feedback or requests for additional features. - The goals of the Drosophila Genome Center are to finish the sequence of the euchromatic genome of Drosophila melanogaster to high quality and to generate and maintain biological annotations of this sequence. In addition to genomic sequencing, the BDGP is \n1) producing gene disruptions using P element-mediated mutagenesis on a scale unprecedented in metazoans; \n2) characterizing the sequence and expression of cDNAs; and \n3) developing informatics tools that support the experimental process, identify features of DNA sequence, and allow us to present up-to-date information about the annotated sequence to the research community.",

A grid infrastructure will be implemented that allows efficient distributed data processing and inter-institutional data exchange. Aim of the effort was to develop an infrastructure for uniform access to heterogeneous data and distributed data processing. The work was structured in two projects funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. The first project was part of the D-Grid initiative and explored the potential of grid technology for climate research and developed a prototype infrastructure. Details about the C3Grid architecture are described in “Earth System Modelling – Volume 6”. In the second phase \"C3Grid - INAD: Towards an Infrastructure for General Access to Climate Data\" this infrastructure was improved especially with respect to interoperability to Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF). Further the portfolio of available diagnostic workflows was expanded.\nThese workflows can be re-used now in adjacent infrastructures MiKlip Evaluation Tool (http://www.fona-miklip.de/en/index.php) and as Web Processes within the Birdhouse Framework (http://bird-house.github.io/).\nThe Birdhouse Framework is now funded as part of the European Copernicus Climate Change Service (https://climate.copernicus.eu/) managed by ECMWF and will be extended to provide scalable processing services for ESGF hosted data at DKRZ as well as IPSL and BADC.",

    "description": "TERN's AEKOS data portal is the original gateway to Australian ecology data. It is a ‘data and research methods’ data portal for Australia’s land-dwelling plants, animals and their environments. The primary focus of data content is raw co-located ‘species and environment’ ecological survey data that has been collected at the ‘plot’ level to describe biodiversity, its patterns and ecological processes.  It is openly accessible with standard discovery metadata and user-oriented, contextual metadata critical for data reuse. Our services support the ecosystem science community, land managers and governments seeking to publish under COPE publishing ethics and the FAIR data publishing principles. AEKOS is registered with Thomson & Reuters Data Citation Index and is a recommended repository of Nature Publishing’s Scientific Data.  There are currently 97,037 sites covering mostly plant biodiversity and co-located environmental data of Australia.  The AEKOS initiative is supported by TERN (tern.org.au), hosted by The University of Adelaide and funded by the Australian Government’s National Research Infrastructure for Australia.",

In 2004 the DAI and the Research Archive for Ancient Sculpture at the University of Cologne (FA) joined the effort to support Arachne as a tool for free internet-based research.\nArachne's database design uses a model that builds on one of the most basic assumptions one can make about archaeology, classical archaeology or art history: all activities in these areas can most generally be described as contextualizing objects. Arachne tries to avoid the basic mistakes of earlier databases, which limited their object modeling to specific project-oriented aspects, thus creating separated containers of only a small number of objects. All objects inside Arachne share a general part of their object model, to which a more class-specific part is added that describes the specialised properties of a category of material like architecture or topography. Seen on the level of the general part, a powerful pool of material can be used for general information retrieval, whereas on the level of categories and properties, very specific structures can be displayed.",

Being geographically largest state of Germany  with a broad range of habitats, Bavaria has a special responsibility for documenting and maintaining its plant diversity . About 85% of all German vascular plant species occur in Bavaria, and in addition it has about 50 endemic taxa, only known from Bavaria (most of them occur in the Alps). The Wiki is collaboration of volunteers and local and regional Bavarian botanical societies.\nEverybody is welcome to contribute, especially with photos or reports of local changes in the flora. The Flora of Bavaria project is providing access to a research data repository for occurrence data powered by the Diversity Workbench database framework.",

This web page has been constructed to provide an accessible database of studies, providing a summary of each study, facilitating an easier comparison across studies. However, it also highlights the need for uniform reporting of results of studies, to facilitate more direct comparisons being made.\nDescription: Studies recorded in this database include complete and partial genome scans, single chromosome scans, as well as fine mapping studies, and contain all known reports that were published in peer-reviewed journals and readily available conference proceedings, initially up to April 2005. However, this data base is being added to, as indicated by the last web update. Note that some duplication of results will occur, in that there may be a number of reports on the same resource population, but utilising different marker densities or different statistical methodologies. The traits recorded in this map are milk yield, milk composition (protein yield, protein %, fat yield, fat %), and somatic cell score (SCS).",

Geomagnetic data are transmitted from observatories and stations located in Russia and near-abroad countries. The Center also provides access to spaceborne data products. The MAGNUS hardware-software system underlies the operation of the Center. Its particular feature is the automated real-time recognition of artificial (anthropogenic) disturbances in incoming data. Being based on fuzzy logic approach, this quality control service facilitates the preparation of the definitive magnetograms from preliminary records carried out by data experts manually. The MAGNUS system also performs on-the-fly multi-criteria estimation of geomagnetic activity using several indicators and provides online tools for modeling electromagnetic parameters in the near-Earth space.\nThe collected geomagnetic data are stored using relational database management system. The geomagnetic database is intended for storing both 1-minute and 1-second data. The results of anthropogenic and natural disturbance recognition are also stored in the database.",

Extensive wildfire which occurred during the study reduced the number of sites to 28 (seven in each of four age classes) upon which analyses and inferences were made. Mature vegetation (> 100 years) had the greatest richness, abundance and biomass of birds. Key ecological resources, such as tree-hollows for nesting, generally occurred mostly in stands > 60 years.

    "description": "The aim of the Freshwater Biodiversity Data Portal is to integrate and provide open and free access to freshwater biodiversity data from all possible sources. To this end, we offer tools and support for scientists interested in documenting/advertising their dataset in the metadatabase, in submitting or publishing their primary biodiversity data (i.e. species occurrence records) or having their dataset linked to the Freshwater Biodiversity Data Portal. This information portal serves as a data discovery tool, and allows scientists and managers to complement, integrate, and analyse distribution data to elucidate patterns in freshwater biodiversity. The Freshwater Biodiversity Data Portal was initiated under the EU FP7 BioFresh project and continued through the Freshwater Information Platform (http://www.freshwaterplatform.eu). To ensure the broad availability of biodiversity data and integration in the global GBIF index, we strongly encourages scientists to submit any primary biodiversity data published in a scientific paper to national nodes of GBIF or to thematic initiatives such as the Freshwater Biodiversity Data Portal.",

    "description": "BLLAST is a research programme aimed at exploring the late afternoon transition of the atmospheric boundary layer.\nThe late afternoon period of the diurnal cycle of the boundary layer is poorly understood. This is yet an important transition period that impacts the transport and dillution of water vapour and trace species. The main questions adressed by the project are:\n- How the turbulence activity fades when heating by the surface decreases?\n- What is the impact on the transport of chemical species?\n- How relevant processes can be represented in numerical models?\nTo answer all these questions, a field campaign was carried out during the summer of 2011 (from June 14 to July 8). Many observation systems were then deployed and operated by research teams coming from France and abroad. They were spanning a large spectrum of space and time scales in order to achieve a comprehensive description of the boundary layer processes. The observation strategy consisted in intensifying the operations in the late afternoon with tethered balloons, resarch aircrafts and UAVs.",

They come in very different shapes and have very different properties; they may be large or small, old or young, red or blue, regular or confused, luminous or faint, dusty or gas-poor, rotating or static, round or disky, and they live either in splendid isolation or in clusters. In other words, the universe contains a very colourful and diverse zoo of galaxies. For almost a century, astronomers have been discussing how galaxies should be classified and how they relate to each other in an attempt to attack the big question of how galaxies form. Galaxy Zoo (Lintott et al. 2008, 2011) pioneered a novel method for performing large-scale visual classifications of survey datasets.

Earthquake alerts – which were formerly sent based only on event magnitude and location, or population exposure to shaking – now will also be generated based on the estimated range of fatalities and economic losses. \nPAGER uses these earthquake parameters to calculate estimates of ground shaking by using the methodology and software developed for ShakeMaps. ShakeMap sites provide near-real-time maps of ground motion and shaking intensity following significant earthquakes. These maps are used by federal, state, and local organizations, both public and private, for post-earthquake response and recovery, public and scientific information, as well as for preparedness exercises and disaster planning.",

In concert with these ambitious efforts, accurate and precise ground-based measurements in differing climatic regions are essential to refine and verify the satellite-based estimates, as well as to support specialized research.\nTo fill this niche, the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) was established in 1993 through the support of NOAA's Office of Global Programs.",

The five small satellites were launched together on a Delta II rocket and they carry identical sets of instruments including an electric field instrument (EFI), a flux gate magnetometer (FGM), a search coil magnetometer (SCM), a electro-static analyzer, and solid state telescopes (SST). The mission consists of several phases. In the first phase, the spacecraft will all orbit as a tight cluster in the same orbital plane with apogee at 15.4 Earth radii (RE). In the second phase, also called the Dawn Phase, the satellites will be placed in their orbits and during this time their apogees will be on the dawn side of the magnetosphere. During the third phase (also known as the Tail Science Phase) the apogees will be in the magnetotail. The fourth phase is called the Dusk Phase or Radiation Belt Science Phase, with all apogees on the dusk side. In the fifth and final phase, the apogees will shift to the sunward side (Dayside Science Phase). The satellite data will be combined with observations of the aurora from a network of 20 ground observatories across the North American continent. \nThe THEMIS-B (THEMIS-P1) and THEMIS-C (THEMIS-P2) were repurposed to study the lunar environment in 2009.

In exploring these issues, while maintaining high ecological validity, our lab integrates a wide range of methodologies, including laboratory experiments, field studies, social network analysis, and agent-based simulations.",

    "description": "Cell phones have become an important platform for the understanding of social dynamics and influence, because of their pervasiveness, sensing capabilities, and computational power. Many applications have emerged in recent years in mobile health, mobile banking, location based services, media democracy, and social movements. With these new capabilities, we can potentially be able to identify exact points and times of infection for diseases, determine who most influences us to gain weight or become healthier, know exactly how information flows among employees and productivity emerges in our work spaces, and understand how rumors spread.\nIn an attempt to address these challenges, we release several mobile data sets here in \"Reality Commons\" that contain the dynamics of several communities of about 100 people each. We invite researchers to propose and submit their own applications of the data to demonstrate the scientific and business values of these data sets, suggest how to meaningfully extend these experiments to larger populations, and develop the math that fits agent-based models or systems dynamics models to larger populations. \nThese data sets were collected with tools developed in the MIT Human Dynamics Lab and are now available as open source projects  or at cost.",

    "description": "SCISAT, also known as the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE), is a Canadian Space Agency small satellite mission for remote sensing of the Earth's atmosphere using solar occultation. The satellite was launched on 12 August 2003 and continues to function perfectly. The primary mission goal is to improve our understanding of the chemical and dynamical processes that control the distribution of ozone in the stratosphere and upper troposphere, particularly in the Arctic. The high precision and accuracy of solar occultation makes SCISAT useful for monitoring changes in atmospheric composition and the validation of other satellite instruments. The satellite carries two instruments. A high resolution (0.02 cm-¹) infrared Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) operating from 2 to 13 microns (750-4400 cm-¹) is measuring the vertical distribution of trace gases, particles and temperature. This provides vertical profiles of atmospheric constituents including essentially all of the major species associated with ozone chemistry. Aerosols and clouds are monitored using the extinction of solar radiation at 1.02 and 0.525 microns as measured by two filtered imagers. The vertical resolution of the FTS is about 3-4 km from the cloud tops up to about 150 km. Peter Bernath of the University of Waterloo is the principal investigator. A dual optical spectrograph called MAESTRO (Measurement of Aerosol Extinction in the Stratosphere and Troposphere Retrieved by Occultation) covers the 400-1030 nm spectral region and measures primarily ozone, nitrogen dioxide and aerosol/cloud extinction. It has a vertical resolution of about 1-2 km. Tom McElroy of Environment and Climate Change Canada is the principal investigator. ACE data are freely available from the University of Waterloo website. SCISAT was designated an ESA Third Party Mission in 2005. ACE data are freely available through an ESA portal.",

Equipped with a powerful synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instrument, it acquired images of the Earth day or night, in all weather and through cloud cover, smoke and haze.\nRADARSAT-1 was a Canadian-led project involving the Canadian federal government, the Canadian provinces, the United States, and the private sector. It provided useful information to both commercial and scientific users in such fields as disaster management, interferometry, agriculture, cartography, hydrology, forestry, oceanography, ice studies and coastal monitoring.\nIn 2007, RADARSAT-2 was launched, producing over 75,000 images per year since. In 2019, the RADARSAT Constellation Mission was deployed, using its three-satellite configuration for all-condition coverage.

The services consist of the following service components: IDA – Research Data Storage; Etsin – Research Data Finder; Qvain – Research Dataset Metadata Tool; Metax – Metadata Warehouse; AVAA – Dynamic Data Publishing Platform and the Digital Preservation Service for Research Data (including management and packaging). The services also provide means for applying for and granting permits to use restricted access datasets.\nThe service is offered free of charge for its users. The services are available to the research community in accordance with the applicable usage policy. Minedu offers access to research data storage service IDA to Finnish higher education institutions, state research institutes and projects funded by the Academy of Finland. Minedu may also grant separate access or storage capacity to the service. Finnish higher education institutions and research institutes may distribute IDA storage capacity to actors within the Finnish research system, within the limits of their usage shares.\nThe service is intended for storing research data and materials related to it. The data stored in the service is available to all project users. The users mark their data to be persistently stored (“Frozen”) in the service. All project members may make the “Frozen” data and related metadata publicly accessible by using the other aforementioned Fairdata services. The data in the service is stored in Finland.\nIDA service stores the data stored by organisations projects continuously or until it’s transferred to digital preservation, provided that the Terms of Use are met.

The metadata contained in Etsin makes it easy for anyone to discover the datasets.  Etsin assigns a permanent URN identifier to datasets, making it possible to link to the dataset and gather merit through its publication and use.\nThe metadata enables users to search for datasets and evaluate the potential for reuse. Etsin includes a description of the dataset, keywords and various dataset identifiers. The dataset information includes, for example, its subject, language, author, owner and how it is licensed for reuse. Good description of data plays an important role in its discoverability and visibility. Etsin encourages comprehensive descriptions by adapting a common set of discipline independent metadata fields and by making it easy to enter metadata.\nEtsin only collects metadata on datasets, not the data themselves. Anyone may browse and read the metadata. Etsin can be used with a browser or through an open interface (API). The service is discipline independent and free to use. \nEtsin is a service provided by the Ministry of Education and Culture to actors in the Finnish research system.

Metabolomics represents the systematic study of low molecular weight molecules found in a biological sample, providing a \"snapshot\" of the current and actual state of the cell or organism at a specific point in time. Thus, the metabolome represents the functional activity of biological systems. As with other ‘omics’, metabolites are conserved across animals, plants and microbial species, facilitating the extrapolation of research findings in laboratory animals to humans. Common technologies for measuring the metabolome include mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), which can measure hundreds to thousands of unique chemical entities.\nData sharing in metabolomics will include primary raw data and the biological and analytical meta-data necessary to interpret these data. Through cooperation between investigators, metabolomics laboratories and data coordinating centers, these data sets should provide a rich resource for the research community to enhance preclinical, clinical and translational research.",

LIPID Metabolites And Pathways Strategy (LIPID MAPS®) is a multi-institutional effort created in 2003 to identify and quantitate, using a systems biology approach and sophisticated mass spectrometers, all of the major — and many minor — lipid species in mammalian cells, as well as to quantitate the changes in these species in response to perturbation.\nThe ultimate goal of our research is to better understand lipid metabolism and the active role lipids play in diabetes, stroke, cancer, arthritis, Alzheimer's and other lipid-based diseases in order to facilitate development of more effective treatments.\nSince our inception, we have made great strides toward defining the \"lipidome\" (an inventory of the thousands of individual lipid molecular species) in the mouse macrophage. We have also worked to make lipid analysis easier and more accessible for the broader scientific community and to advance a robust research infrastructure for the international research community. We share new lipidomics findings and methods, hold annual meetings open to all interested investigators, and are exploring joint efforts to extend the use of these powerful new methods to new applications",

    "description": "Giardia lamblia is a significant, environmentally transmitted, human pathogen and an amitochondriate protist. It is a major contributor to the enormous worldwide burden of human diarrheal diseases, yet the basic biology of this parasite is not well understood. No virulence factor has been identified. The Giardia lamblia genome contains only 12 million base pairs distributed onto five chromosomes. Its analysis promises to provide insights about the origins of nuclear genome organization, the metabolic pathways used by parasitic protists, and the cellular biology of host interaction and avoidance of host immune systems.\nSince the divergence of Giardia lamblia lies close to the transition between eukaryotes and prokaryotes in universal ribosomal RNA phylogenies, it is a valuable, if not unique, model for gaining basic insights into genetic innovations that led to formation of eukaryotic cells. In evolutionary terms, the divergence of this organism is at least twice as ancient as the common ancestor for yeast and man. A detailed study of its genome will provide insights into an early evolutionary stage of eukaryotic chromosome organization as well as other aspects of the prokaryotic / eukaryotic divergence.",

It provides not only groups shared by two or more species/genomes, but also groups representing species-specific gene expansion families. So it serves as an important utility for automated eukaryotic genome annotation. OrthoMCL starts with reciprocal best hits within each genome as potential in-paralog/recent paralog pairs and reciprocal best hits across any two genomes as potential ortholog pairs. Related proteins are interlinked in a similarity graph. Then MCL (Markov Clustering algorithm,Van Dongen 2000; www.micans.org/mcl) is invoked to split mega-clusters. This process is analogous to the manual review in COG construction. MCL clustering is based on weights between each pair of proteins, so to correct for differences in evolutionary distance the weights are normalized before running MCL.",

Signaling networks are the key to deciphering many of the complex networks that govern the machinery inside the cell. Several signaling molecules play an important role in disease processes that are a direct result of their altered functioning and are now recognized as potential therapeutic targets. Understanding how to restore the proper functioning of these pathways that have become deregulated in disease, is needed for accelerating biomedical research. This resource is aimed at demystifying the biological pathways and highlights the key relationships and connections between them. Apart from this, pathways provide a way of reducing the dimensionality of high throughput data, by grouping thousands of genes, proteins and metabolites at functional level into just several hundreds of pathways for an experiment. Identifying the active pathways that differ between two conditions can have more explanatory power than just a simple list of differentially expressed genes and proteins.",

Unique in its role as a one-stop-shop for global temperate reef data, TemperateReefBase was initially established by IMAS in collaboration with the Kelp Ecology Ecosystem Network (KEEN).\nKEEN was instigated through a National Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) working group which assembled experts from around the world to examine the impacts of global change on kelp-bed ecosystem worldwide. The group has assembled significant global data for kelps, other seaweeds and associated species including fishes, and has embarked on unprecedented global experiments and surveys in which identical experiments and surveys are being conducted at sites in kelp beds around the world to determine global trends and examine the capacity of kelps to respond to disturbance in the face of climate change and other anthropogenic stressors.\nThe TemperateReefBase Data Portal is an online discovery interface showcasing temperate reef data collected from around the globe. The portal aims to make this data freely and openly available for the benefit of marine and environmental science as a whole.\nThe TemperateReefBase Data Portal is hosted and maintained by the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies at the University of Tasmania, Australia.",

    "description": "Genome resource samples of wild animals, particularly those of endangered mammalian and avian species, are very difficult to collect. In Korea, many of these animals such as tigers, leopards, bears, wolves, foxes, gorals, and river otters, are either already extinct, long before the Korean biologists had the opportunity to study them, or are near extinction. Therefore, proposal for a systematic collection and preservation of genetic samples of these precious animals was adopted by Korea Science & Engineering Foundation (KOSEF). As an outcome, Conservation Genome Resource Bank for Korean Wildlife (CGRB; www.cgrb.org) was established in 2002 at the College of Veterinary Medicine, Seoul National University as one of the Special Research Materials Bank supported by the Scientific and Research Infrastructure Building Program of KOSEF. CGRB operates in collaboration with Seoul Grand Park Zoo managed by Seoul Metropolitan Government, and has offices and laboratories at both Seoul National University and Seoul Grand Park, where duplicate samples are maintained, thereby assuring a long-term, safe preservation of the samples. Thus, CGRB is the first example of the collaborative scientific infrastructure program between university and zoo in Korea.",

CSISA generates data that is of value and interest to a diverse audience of researchers, policymakers and the public.\nCSISA’s data repository is hosted on Dataverse, an open source web application developed at Harvard University to share, preserve, cite, explore and analyze research data. CSISA’s repository contains rich datasets, including on-station trial data from 2009–17 about crop and resource management practices for sustainable future cereal-based cropping systems. Collection of this data occurred during the long-term, on-station research trials conducted at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research – Research Complex for the Eastern Region in Bihar, India. The data include information on agronomic management for the sustainable intensification of cropping systems, mechanization, diversification, futuristic approaches to sustainable intensification, long-term effects of conservation agriculture practices on soil health and the pest spectrum.\nAdditional trial data in the repository includes nutrient omission plot technique trials from Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh and Odisha, India, covering 2012–15, which help determine the indigenous nutrient supplying ability of the soil. This data helps develop precision nutrient management approaches that would be most effective in different types of soils.\nCSISA’s most popular dataset thus far includes crop cut data on maize in Odisha, India and rice in Nepal. Crop cut datasets provide ground-truthed yield estimates, as well as valuable information on relevant agronomic and socioeconomic practices affecting production practices and yield. A variety of research data on wheat systems are also available from Bangladesh and India. Additional crop cut data will also be coming online soon.\nCropping system-related data and socioeconomic data are in the repository, some of which are cross-listed with a Dataverse run by the International Food Policy Research Institute. The socioeconomic datasets contain baseline information that is crucial for technology targeting, as well as to assess the adoption and performance of CSISA-supported technologies under smallholder farmers’ constrained conditions, representing the ultimate litmus test of their potential for change at scale. Other highly interesting datasets include farm composition and productive trajectory information, based on a 20-year panel dataset, and numerous wheat crop cut and maize nutrient omission trial data from across Bangladesh.",

    "description": "The Indian Census is the largest single source of a variety of statistical information on different characteristics of the people of India. With a history of more than 130 years, this reliable, time tested exercise has been bringing out a veritable wealth of statistics every 10 years, beginning from 1872 when the first census was conducted in India non-synchronously in different parts. To scholars and researchers in demography, economics, anthropology, sociology, statistics and many other disciplines, the Indian Census has been a fascinating source of data. The rich diversity of the people of India is truly brought out by the decennial census which has become one of the tools to understand and study India\n\n\nThe responsibility of conducting the decennial Census rests with the Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner, India under Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. It may be of historical interest that though the population census of India is a major administrative function; the Census Organisation was set up on an ad-hoc basis for each Census till the 1951 Census. The Census Act was enacted in 1948 to provide for the scheme of conducting population census with duties and responsibilities of census officers. The Government of India decided in May 1949 to initiate steps for developing systematic collection of statistics on the size of population, its growth, etc., and established an organisation in the Ministry of Home Affairs under Registrar General and ex-Officio Census Commissioner, India. This organisation was made responsible for generating data on population statistics including Vital Statistics and Census. Later, this office was also entrusted with the responsibility of implementation of Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969 in the country.",

    "description": "Survey of India, The National Survey and Mapping Organization of the country under the Department of Science & Technology, is the OLDEST SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT OF THE GOVT. OF INDIA. It was set up in 1767 and has evolved rich traditions over the years. In its assigned role as the nation's Principal Mapping Agency, Survey of India bears a special responsibility to ensure that the country's domain is explored and mapped suitably, provide base maps for expeditious and integrated development and ensure that all resources contribute with their full measure to the progress, prosperity and security of our country now and for generations to come.\nThe history of the Survey of India dates back to the 18th Century. Forerunners of army of the East India Company and Surveyors had an onerous task of exploring the unknown. Bit by bit the tapestry of Indian terrain was completed by the painstaking efforts of a distinguished line of Surveyors such as Mr. Lambton and Sir George Everest. It is a tribute to the foresight of such Surveyors that at the time of independence the country inherited a survey network built on scientific principles. The great Trigonometric series spanning the country from North to South East to West are some of the best geodetic control series available in the world. The scientific principles of surveying have since been augmented by the latest technology to meet the multidisciplinary requirement of data from planners and scientists.\nOrganized into only 5 Directorates in 1950, mainly to look after the mapping needs of Defense Forces in North West and North East, the Department has now grown into 22 Directorates spread in approx. all parts (states) of the country to provide the basic map coverage required for the development of the country. Its technology, latest in the world, has been oriented to meet the needs of defense forces, planners and scientists in the field of geo-sciences, land and resource management. Its expert advice is being utilized by various Ministries and undertakings of Govt. of India in many sensitive areas including settlement of International borders, State boundaries and in assisting planned development of hitherto under developed areas.\nFaced with the requirement of digital topographical data, the department has created three Digital Centers during late eighties to generate Digital Topographical Data Base for the entire country for use in various planning processes and creation of geographic information system. Its specialized Directorates such as Geodetic and Research Branch, and Indian Institute of Surveying & Mapping (erstwhile Survey Training Institute) have been further strengthened to meet the growing requirement of user community. The department is also assisting in many scientific programs of the Nation related to the field of geo-physics, remote sensing and digital data transfers.",

    "description": "This is CSDB version 1 merged from Bacterial (BCSDB) and Plant&Fungal (PFCSDB) databases. This database aims at provision of structural, bibliographic, taxonomic, NMR spectroscopic and other information on glycan and glycoconjugate structures of prokaryotic, plant and fungal origin. It has been merged from the Bacterial and Plant&Fungal Carbohydrate Structure Databases (BCSDB+PFCSDB). The key points of this service are:\n High coverage. The coverage for bacteria (up to 2016) and archaea (up to 2016) is above 80%. Similar coverage for plants and fungi is expected in the future. The database is close to complete up to 1998 for plants, and up to 2006 for fungi.\nData quality. High data quality is achieved by manual curation using original publications which is assisted by multiple automatic procedures for error control. Errors present in publications are reported and corrected, when possible. Data from other databases are verified on import.\nDetailed annotations. Structural data are supplied with extended bibliography, assigned NMR spectra, taxon identification including strains and serogroups, and other information if available in the original publication.\nServices. CSDB serves as a platform for a number of computational services tuned for glycobiology, such as NMR simulation, automated structure elucidation, taxon clustering, 3D molecular modeling, statistical processing of data etc.\nIntegration. CSDB is cross-linked to other glycoinformatics projects and NCBI databases. The data are exportable in various formats, including most widespread encoding schemes and records using GlycoRDF ontology.\nFree web access. Users can access the database for free via its web interface (see Help). \nThe main source of data is retrospective literature analysis. About 20% of data were imported from CCSD (Carbbank, University of Georgia, Athens; structures published before 1996) with subsequent manual curation and approval. The current coverage is displayed in red on the top of the left menu. The time lag between the publication of new data and their deposition into CSDB is ca. 1 year.\nIn the scope of bacterial carbohydrates, CSDB covers nearly all structures of this origin published up to 2016. Prokaryotic, plant and fungal means that a glycan was found in the organism(s) belonging to these taxonomic domains or was obtained by modification of those found in them. Carbohydrate means a structure composed of any residues linked by glycosidic, ester, amidic, ketal, phospho- or sulpho-diester bonds in which at least one residue is a sugar or its derivative.",

The HOMD presents a provisional naming scheme for the currently unnamed species so that strain, clone, and probe data from any laboratory can be directly linked to a stably named reference scheme. The HOMD links sequence data with phenotypic, phylogenetic, clinical, and bibliographic information. Genome sequences for oral bacteria determined as part of this project, the Human Microbiome Project, and other sequencing projects are being added to the HOMD as they become available. Genomes for 315 oral taxa (46% of taxa o­n HOMD) are currently available o­n HOMD. The HOMD site offers easy to use tools for viewing all publically available oral bacterial genomes.",

The alignments are constructed based on 3D structure superposition and manually refined to ensure alignment of important functional residues.

It is specifically designed to serve as an evaluation resource to address all the problems encountered when aligning complete sequences. The first release provided sets of reference alignments dealing with the problems of high variability, unequal repartition and large N/C-terminal extensions and internal insertions. Version 2.0 of the database incorporates three new reference sets of alignments containing structural repeats, trans-membrane sequences and circular permutations to evaluate the accuracy of detection/prediction and alignment of these complex sequences.\nWithin the resource, users can look at a list of all the alignments, download the whole database by ftp, get the \"c\" program to compare a test alignment with the BAliBASE reference (The source code for the program is freely available), or look at the results of a comparison study of several multiple alignment programs, using BAliBASE reference sets.",

Ancient sundials were built using basic geometrical forms of very few construction types taking also into account the astronomical dimensions. In architectural drawings, comparable proportions can be found. The tower of the winds merges all these geometrical principles of construction. The construction drawings of this collection comprise geometrical drafts used for the construction of buildings. They differ from simple geometrical forms in that they present the general layout of the lines indicating objects and geometrical areas. Their geometrical dimensions are constructed according to the principles of proportional relations and were implemented in – sometimes very complex – work processes in which artefacts of the original objects were constructed. Construction drawings from the pillars of Didyma, which were discovered by Lothar Haselberger, serve as a paradigmatic model for these architectural drawings.",

Correctness and completeness were pursued for all information relevant to stature, i.e. basic information such as sex (after Sjøvold 1988) and age (after Szilvássy 1988) as well as the long bone measurements, whereas other measurements were merely inherited from the two integrated older data bases and not explicitly checked.

The main source of cobalt ore used during this period has been identified in the Egyptian Western Desert, around the oases of Kharga and Dakhla. The data presented here was obtained in order to better understand the chaîne opératoire of Late Bronze Age glass production and -working, in particular with regard to cobalt ore. For this purpose, chemical analysis by portable X-Ray fluorescence (pXRF) was carried out in the field on contextualised archaeological material excavated at the site of Amarna, which cannot be exported from Egypt for analysis.

The Centre primarily acquires individual-specific microdata for the analysis of life courses, employment biographies and biographies (primarily quantitative, but also qualitative data), which offer a broad interdisciplinary and international analytical framework and meet clearly defined methodological and technical requirements. The studies are processed, archived and - in compliance with data protection and copyright conditions - made available to the scientifically interested public in accordance with internationally recognized standards. The degree of preparation depends on the type and quality of the study and on demand. Reference studies and studies in high demand are comprehensively documented - often in cooperation with primary researchers or experts - and summarized in data collections. \nThe Historical Data Centre supports researchers in meeting the high demands of research data management. This includes the advisory support of the entire life cycle of data, starting with data production, documentation, analysis, evaluation, publication, long-term archiving and finally the subsequent use of data. In cooperation with other infrastructure facilities of the state of Saxony-Anhalt as well as national and international, interdisciplinary data repositories, the Data Centre provides tools and infrastructures for the publication and long-term archiving of research data. Together with the University and State Library of Saxony-Anhalt, the Data Centre operates its own data repository as well as special workstations for the digitisation and analysis of data.\nThe Historical Data Centre aims to be a contact point for very different users of historical sources.

WikiPathways is an open, collaborative platform dedicated to the curation of biological pathways. WikiPathways thus presents a new model for pathway databases that enhances and complements ongoing efforts, such as KEGG, Reactome and Pathway Commons. Building on the same MediaWiki software that powers Wikipedia, we added a custom graphical pathway editing tool and integrated databases covering major gene, protein, and small-molecule systems. The familiar web-based format of WikiPathways greatly reduces the barrier to participate in pathway curation. More importantly, the open, public approach of WikiPathways allows for broader participation by the entire community, ranging from students to senior experts in each field. This approach also shifts the bulk of peer review, editorial curation, and maintenance to the community.",

    "description": "As 3D and reality capture strategies for heritage documentation become more widespread and available, there has emerged a growing need to assist with guiding and facilitating accessibility to data, while maintaining scientific rigor, cultural and ethical sensitivity, discoverability, and archival standards. In response to these areas of need, The Open Heritage 3D Alliance (OHA) has developed as an advisory group governing the Open Heritage 3D initiative. This collaborative advisory group are among some of the earliest adopters of 3D heritage documentation technologies, and offer first-hand guidance for best practices in data management, sharing, and dissemination approaches for 3D cultural heritage projects.\nThe founding members of the OHA, consist of experts and organizational leaders from CyArk, Historic Environment Scotland, and the University of South Florida Libraries, who together have significant repositories of legacy and on-going 3D research and documentation projects. These groups offer unique insight into not only the best practices for 3D data capture and sharing, but also have come together around concerns dealing with standards, formats, approach, ethics, and archive commitment. Together, the OHA has begun the journey to provide open access to cultural heritage 3D data, while maintaining integrity, security, and standards relating to discoverable dissemination. Together, the OHA will work to provide democratized access to primary heritage 3D data submitted from donors and organizations, and will help to facilitate an operation platform, archive, and organization of resources into the future.",

From these, profiles of temperature and atmospheric trace gases were retrieved using the research data processor developed at the Institut für Meteorologie und Klimaforschung (IMK), which is complemented by the component of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) treatment from the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía (IAA). The MIPAS data products on this server are commonly known as IMK/IAA MIPAS Level2 data products. The MIPAS instrument measured during two time frames: from 2002 to 2004 in full spectral resolution (high resolution = HR aka full resolution = FR), and from 2005 to 2012 in reduced spectral, but improved spatial resolution (reduced resolution = RR aka optimized resolution = OR). For this reason, there are different version numbers covering the full MIPAS mission period: xx for the HR/FR period, and 2xx for the RR/OR period (example: 61 for HR/FR, 261 for RR/OR). Beyond this, measurements were conducted in different modes covering different altitude ranges during the RR period: Nominal (6 – 70 km), MA (18 – 102 km), NLC (39 – 102 km), UA (42 – 172 km), UTLS-1 (5.5 – 19 km), UTLS-2 (12 – 42 km), AE (7 – 38 km). The non-nominal modes are identified by the following version numbers: MA = 5xx, NLC = 7xx, UA = 6xx, UTLS-1/2 = 1xx (no retrievals for AE mode).",

KiDKo is a multi-modal digital corpus of spontaneous discourse data from informal, oral peer group situations in multi- and monoethnic speech communities.\nKiDKo contains audio data from self-recordings, with aligned transcriptions (i.e., at every point in a transcript, one can access the corresponding area in the audio file). The corpus provides parts-of-speech tags as well as an orthographically normalised layer (Rehbein & Schalowski 2013). Another annotation level provides information on syntactic chunks and topological fields.\nThere are several complementary corpora:\nKiDKo/E (Einstellungen - \"attitudes\") captures spontaneous data from the public discussion on Kiezdeutsch: it assembles emails and readers' comments posted in reaction to media reports on Kiezdeutsch. By doing so, KiDKo/E provides data on language attitudes, language perceptions, and language ideologies, which became apparent in the context of the debate on Kiezdeutsch, but which frequently related to such broader domains as multilingualism, standard language, language prestige, and social class.\nKiDKo/LL (\"Linguistic Landscape\") assembles photos of written language productions in public space from the context of Kiezdeutsch, for instance love notes on walls, park benches, and playgrounds, graffiti in house entrances, and scribbled messages on toilet walls.\nContains materials in following languages: Spanish, Italian, Greek, Kurdish, Swedish, French, Croatian, Arabic, Turkish.",

    "description": "We present the MUSE-Wide survey, a blind, 3D spectroscopic survey in the CANDELS/GOODS-S and CANDELS/COSMOS regions. Each MUSE-Wide pointing has a depth of 1 hour and hence targets more extreme and more luminous objects over 10 times the area of the MUSE-Deep fields (Bacon et al. 2017). The legacy value of MUSE-Wide lies in providing \"spectroscopy of everything\" without photometric pre-selection. We describe the data reduction, post-processing and PSF characterization of the first 44 CANDELS/GOODS-S MUSE-Wide pointings released with this publication. Using a 3D matched filtering approach we detected 1,602 emission line sources, including 479 Lyman-α (Lya) emitting galaxies with redshifts 2.9≲z≲6.3. We cross-match the emission line sources to existing photometric catalogs, finding almost complete agreement in redshifts and stellar masses for our low redshift (z < 1.5) emitters. At high redshift, we only find ~55% matches to photometric catalogs. We encounter a higher outlier rate and a systematic offset of Δz≃0.2 when comparing our MUSE redshifts with photometric redshifts. Cross-matching the emission line sources with X-ray catalogs from the Chandra Deep Field South, we find 127 matches, including 10 objects with no prior spectroscopic identification. Stacking X-ray images centered on our Lya emitters yielded no signal; the Lya population is not dominated by even low luminosity AGN. A total of 9,205 photometrically selected objects from the CANDELS survey lie in the MUSE-Wide footprint, which we provide optimally extracted 1D spectra of. We are able to determine the spectroscopic redshift of 98% of 772 photometrically selected galaxies brighter than 24th F775W magnitude. All the data in the first data release - datacubes, catalogs, extracted spectra, maps - are available at the website.",

Key initiatives under FinBIF include the digitization of collections, the development of data systems for collections Kotka (https://biss.pensoft.net/article/37179/) and observations (https://biss.pensoft.net/article/39150/), and the establishment of a national DNA barcode reference library. \n\nFinBIF manages data types such as verbal species descriptions (which include drawings, pictures, and other media types), biological taxonomy, scientific collection specimens, opportunistic systematic and event-based observations, and DNA barcodes. It employs a unified IT architecture to manage data flows, delivers services through a single online portal, fosters collaboration under a cohesive umbrella concept, and articulates development visions under a unified brand. The portal Laji.fi serves as the entry point to this harmonized open data ecosystem. FinBIF's portal is accessible in Finnish, Swedish, and English. Data intended for restricted use are made available to authorities through a separate portal, while open data are also shared with international systems, such as GBIF.",

The choice of such references —i.e., templates— and atlases is one relevant source of methodological variability across studies, which has recently been brought to attention as an important challenge to reproducibility in neuroscience. TemplateFlow is a publicly available framework for human and nonhuman brain models. The framework combines an open database with software for access, management, and vetting, allowing scientists to distribute their resources under FAIR —findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable— principles. TemplateFlow supports a multifaceted insight into brains across species, and enables multiverse analyses testing whether results generalize across standard references, scales, and in the long term, species, thereby contributing to increasing the reliability of neuroimaging results.",

Users can explore GeneLab datasets in the Data Repository, analyze data using the Analysis Platform, and create collaborative projects using the Collaborative Workspace. GeneLab promises to facilitate and improve information sharing, foster innovation, and increase the pace of scientific discovery from extremely rare and valuable space biology experiments. Discoveries made using GeneLab have begun and will continue to deepen our understanding of biology, advance the field of genomics, and help to discover cures for diseases, create better diagnostic tools, and ultimately allow astronauts to better withstand the rigors of long-duration spaceflight.\nGeneLab helps scientists understand how the fundamental building blocks of life itself – DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites – change from exposure to microgravity, radiation, and other aspects of the space environment. GeneLab does so by providing fully coordinated epigenomics, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data alongside essential metadata describing each spaceflight and space-relevant experiment. By carefully curating and implementing best practices for data standards, users can combine individual GeneLab datasets to gain new, comprehensive insights about the effects of spaceflight on biology. In this way, GeneLab extends the scientific knowledge gained from each biological experiment conducted in space, allowing scientists from around the world to make novel discoveries and develop new hypotheses from these priceless data.",

    "description": "Plastics are widely used in our economy and each year, at least 350-400 million tons are being produced at a global level. Due to poor recycling and low circular use, tens of millions of tons accumulate annually in marine and terrestrial environments. While it has become obvious that micro and macroplastics contaminate our environments recent research has identified few bacteria and fungi actively degrading plastics by enzymatic reactions. In general these are promiscuous enzymes (hydrolases) acting on low crystaline and mostly low density polymers of PET, ester-based PUR and oligomers of PA. Notably today, no enzymes have been characterized on a biochemical level for polymeric and crystaline PE, ether-based PUR, PS, PVC, PP. While many publications report on plastic degradation often, no convincing biochemical data have been published. Therefore the PAZy database lists exclusively biochemically characterized plastic-active enzymes. Predicted and putative enzymes that were not characterized on a biochemical, functional or structural level are not included in the PAZy database. The entries are manually curated.",

Besides these data, the species taxa contain information about 16S rRNA gene and/or genome sequences. All publicly available genome data of each type species including both type and non-type strains were collected, and if needed, re-annotated using the standardized analysis pipeline. Furthermore, pan-genomic data analyses were conducted for species with ≥5 genome sequences available. Finally, for all type species, taxonomically relevant phenotypic data were extracted and curated from literatures, which were further indexed into eLMSG as searchable and analyzable data records.

The first purpose of this arrangement is to fulfill the function of a regional knowledge and information center through the acquisition and preservation of a broad collection of historical sources. The second purpose is to make these sources actively available. It does so according to the Dutch Public Records Act (Archiefwet 1995).\nAt the time of writing, the joint arrangement services include 9 municipalities, namely: Alkmaar, Bergen, Castricum, Den Helder, Heiloo, Hollands Kroon, Schagen, Dijk en Waard and Texel. The arrangement also includes other joint arrangements. These are the GGD Hollands Noorden and Veiligheidsregio Noord-Holland Noord. Also, the RAA keeps the archives of the water authority Hoogheemraadschap Hollands Noorderkwartier and its predecessors. This is being done on the basis of a service agreement.\nFinally many archives of families, persons of interest, companies and non-governmental organizations are being collected and managed. This is a secondary task of the RAA, but these archives are also being managed on the ground of the Dutch Public Records Act.",

In 2019, it was designated as a scientific data center at the national level by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (MOST). NHEPSDC is constructed and operated by the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). NHEPSDC consists of a main data center in Beijing, a branch center in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and a branch center in Huairou District of Beijing. The mission of NHEPSDC is to provide the services of data collection, archiving, long-term preservation, access and sharing, software tools, and data analysis. The services of NHEPSDC are mainly for high-energy physics and related scientific research activities. The data collected can be roughly divided into the following two categories: one is the raw data from large scientific facilities, and the other is data generated from general scientific and technological projects (usually supported by government funding), hereafter referred to as generic data. More than 70 people work in NHEPSDC now, with 18 in high-energy physics, 17 in computer science, 15 in software engineering, 20 in data management and some other operation engineers. NHEPSDC is equipped with a hierarchical storage system, high-performance computing power, high bandwidth domestic and international network links, and a professional service support system. In the past three years, the average data increment is about 10 PB per year. By integrating data resources with the IT environment, a state-of-art data process platform is provided to users for scientific research, the volume of data accessed every year is more than 400 PB with more than 10 million visits.",

ISIMIP is organized into simulation rounds, for which a simulation protocol specifies a set of common experiments. The protocol further describes a set of climate and direct human forcing data to be used as input data for all ISIMIP simulations. Based on this information, modelling groups from different sectors (e.g. agriculture, biomes, water) perform simulations using various climate impact models.\nAfter the simulations are performed, the data is collected by the ISIMIP data team, quality controlled and eventually published on the ISIMIP Repository. From there, it can be freely accessed for further research and analyses. The data is widely used within academia, but also by companies and civil society.

    "description": "The abundance of indigenous Italian olive germplasm, numbering over 800 cultivars andrising, guarantees the ongoing production of high quality extra virgin olive oils, thus contributing to the preservation of much of the ancient genetic biodiversity of the olive.\nThe Olea Europea species has maintained much of its genetic diversity as a result of limited genetic erosion. This is due to breeding programs of this species having begun relatively recently compared to those of other fruit species.\nKnowledge and development of the characteristics of Italian monovarietal extra virgin olive oils will also lead to an improvement in knowledge of the areas where these oils are produced, in turn developing tourism, a crucial sector for the Italian economy.\nIn Italy, new regulation was recently introduced forcing virgin and extra virgin olive oil producers to indicate the location of both olive harvest and oil production. More recently the European Commission has established compulsory standards for the labelling of origin for extra virgin and virgin olive oils (Reg EC n.182/2009). The significant increase in demand for extra virgin olive oils is due not only to the health benefits it offers, but also to its organoleptic properties; the large number of Italian olive cultivars allows for the production of different monovarietal oils marked out by a wide range of pleasant flavours.\nAs the genotype of origin affects the chemical and sensory characteristics of extra virginolive oil deeply, the preservation and characterization of authocthonous cultivars and clones play a key role in the marketing of high quality olive oils.\nConservation of genetic resources for olives has important implications for both adaptationof the cultivars to their local environment and their agronomical performance under specific conditions. This also implies that every initiative to promote olive cultivation ought to take into consideration the local varieties and also that every region should preserve its own plant material to safeguard olive adaptation and productivity and to maintain the intrinsic characteristics of its olive oil \nwhich represent a deep connection with the territory of origin.\nItalian olive cultivation is marked out by its extremely rich and varied varietal heritage. Animportant objective being pursued by every region is the protection and preservation of autochthonous Italian olive cultivars. This can be seen in the spread of regional varietal catalogs and also in the ongoing rise in the number of monovarietal olive oils taking part in the Italian National Review of Monovarietal olive oils as organized by AMAP Marche.",

Overall, the collection preserves more than 59,000 accessions of 870 species from 203 genera and 39 families (mainly Poaceae, Fabaceae, Solanaceae, Brassicaceae, Asteraceae, etc.). Over 13,000 samples have been directly collected through time and georeferenced by IBBR exploration teams, while others have been acquired from other Institutions through exchange activities. \nThe main objective of MGG is the preservation of genetic resources of herbaceous plants of interest for the Mediterranean agriculture. Particular attention is dedicated to specific segments of plant genetic resources, such as local varieties (including \"typical products\") or endangered agro-ecotypes, wild relatives of crops and plants potentially useful for the extraction of bioactive or biotechnological compounds. The main commitments of MGG since 1970 are: (i) the collection, conservation and distribution of PGR; (ii) the characterization and evaluation of PGRs and the analysis of their genetic structure; (ii) the selection and pre-breeding of PGR, and the recognition of useful genes.",
