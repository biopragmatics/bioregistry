The APAIS thesaurus was introduced in 1978 when APAIS became available as an online database and was first published by the National Library of Australia in 1980 to facilitate online searching. While still primarily used as an indexing tool, the APAIS thesaurus is an essential aid for efficient online searching of the APAIS and Australian Public Affairs - Full Text databases. Besides serving the APAIS clients the published Thesaurus has been adopted in a number of wider projects that require a structured list of Australian subject terms, such as the recommendation for its use for subject indexing when using the Australian Government Locator Service metadata standard.",

The thesaurus represents terminology and vocabulary usage drawn from IEEE transactions and journal articles, conference papers, and standards. The vocabulary uses American-based spellings with cross references to British variant spellings. The scope and structure of the IEEE Thesaurus reflect the engineering and scientific disciplines that comprise the societies, councils, and communities of IEEE in addition to the technologies IEEE serves. The IEEE Thesaurus contains controlled vocabulary referred to as descriptors or preferred terms*. These descriptors are considered the preferred terms for index usage. Thesaurus construction is based on the ANSI/NISO Z39.19-2005 standard, Guidelines for the Construction, Format, and Management of Monolingual Controlled Vocabularies. Each descriptor included in the thesaurus represents a single concept or unit of thought. The scope of the descriptors is based on the material as presented in IEEE periodical articles, conference papers, standards, and/or IEEE organizational material. The IEEE Thesaurus is a tool to improve and enhance the indexing and retrieval of articles and other material from IEEE periodicals, conferences, standards, and other publications that are made available on IEEE Xplore. It provides a common and consistent language for authors, researchers and online discovery.",

Variations and adaptions are developed as these principles are applied to special collections or general collections for limited or specific patrons. This list of subject headings is intended for use wherever material for use by children from the elementary through the junior high school level is brought together in the public or school library. Children's interests are universal but their vocabulary is still growing along with their learning processes so subject headings which anticipate their approach to a wide variety of material and which employ terminology with which they are familiar are needed to facilitate their use of the library catalog. However, the language and approach of the children must be captured without completely losing touch with standard cataloging practice so that the mastery of the children's catalog will be a step on the road to the understanding and use of the adult catalog in future years.\n\nIn compiling this list in accordance with these principles our personal experiences in school and public libraries were an important factor, but personal opinions have been substantiated by considerable study and research including a master's thesis by Eloise Rue, 'Preferences of Elementary Children for Subject Heading Form'; scrutiny of outstanding courses of study for grades one through nine issued\n\nsince 1944 and an examination of standard tools in use; the results of a questionnaire to school library supervisors, children's departments in public libraries, curriculum specialists, children's catalogers and library school faculties.

This is a classification system widely used in knowledge management of research projects and dissertations. Categories are divided into three hierarchical levels: Fields: Refering to general sections. Encoded with two digits and comprises several disciplines. Disciplines: Provide an overview of specialty groups in Science and Technology. Encoded with four digits. Despite being different from each other disciplines with cross references, or within the same field, are considered to have common characteristics. Subdisciplines: Entries are the more specific elements of the nomenclature and represent the activities that take place within a discipline. Encoded with six digits. In turn, must correspond to individual specialties in science and technology.",

The criterion for classification is the major field of science in which most of the R&D activity is undertaken. When a major private NPI has significant R&D activity in more than one field of science, an attempt may be made to split the statistical unit into smaller units and classify them to relevant major fields of science.\" (2002) \"The existing FOS classification does not fully reflect changes in the science and technology area, especially with regard to emerging technology fields such as ICT, biotechnology and nanotechnology. This, as well as the need to obtain better coverage of the data based on the FOS, the most appropriate classification for R&D in the public sector, motivated the NESTI Group to review the classification.\" (2007)",

And in contrast to various library classifications that are used internationally, it is tailored for commercial use within the trade. It is a flexible standard that allows each market to retain its unique cultural voice while still presenting a unified subject hierarchy that rationalises book classification. The goals of Thema are to reduce the duplication of effort required by the many distinct national subject schemes, and to eliminate the need for scheme-to-scheme mapping that inevitably degrades the accuracy of classification, by providing a single scheme for international use. It can be used alongside existing national schemes like BIC, BISAC, WGS or CLIL, and has the potential to eventually replace them (though this is not an immediate goal).",

    "description": "Note this scheme was originally published as a draft and called e4libraries Subject Category Headings. This scheme was revised by a panel of experts and the new UKSLC scheme is the result of this process. The UKSLC is based on the BIC standard subject categories used in bookshops and by online retailers. The scheme is designed for the public library sector to provide library-oriented category headings applicable across the full range of adult non-fiction, fiction and children's/young adult stock. Many library authorities have adopted categorisation schemes for fiction and non-fiction over the past forty years. The majority of them apply these categories solely at item level to determine shelf display, though a minority also use them to provide a searchable option within the main title-level catalogue record. However, most of these schemes are unique to the authority concerned and rely heavily for their operation on costly and time-consuming staff intervention. Adoption of a scheme of BIC-based standard subject/genre categories, made available to libraries in addition to existing Dewey classifications, offers the opportunity to reduce cost and streamline workflows by automating the categorisation process, and to support further improvements in stock selection, management, discovery and display. (...) At the same time it offers authorities a degree of flexibility in determining item-level shelfmarks, the categories used to organise and display stock in individual locations, allowing them to customise the scheme to meet their specific needs and to integrate it with existing schemes they have already developed. It is very much hoped that UK libraries and their suppliers will adopt UKSLC.",

Because of the diversity in library organizational patterns, documents librarians could probably never agree on one system for classifying state documents. However, those libraries which maintain a separate collection of state documents and also a separate federal documents collection classified by the Superintendent of Documents Classification scheme will be interested in the classification scheme for State of Illinois documents used by the Documents Section, Library, University of Illinois at Chicago Circle. By applying similar principles, this scheme is easily adaptable for publications of other states.

    "description": "The thesaurus has been developed specifically for our collection. The Powerhouse collection covers a wide variety of subject areas and many different types of objects are included. There are approximately 8,600 terms. But we do not claim to have a comprehensive list of all objects and we are actively seeking contributions to broaden the appeal of the thesaurus. We have recently added a number of new terms at the request of the National Museum of Australia, and we continue to work with them in developing the thesaurus. We are hopeful that with contributions from other institutions we can create an Australian standard for object name terminology. This object name thesaurus provides a standard terminology for naming objects. It does not claim to provide the correct name for an object. It merely provides a name for use in museum cataloguing systems to enable accurate retrieval of information about objects. The hierarchical structure of the thesaurus assists in searching. By organising object names, the relationships between objects can be made explicit. Object names are organised according to their hierarchical, associative or equivalence relationships. The object name thesaurus allows for more than one broader term for each object name. Any term is permitted to have multiple broader terms, for example 'Bubble pipes' has the broader terms of 'Pipes' and 'Toys'. There is no single hierarchy in which an object name is located, enabling it to by found by searchers approaching with different concepts in mind. All terms within the thesaurus are plural. This standard was determined when the thesaurus was first published. The thesaurus attempts to place object names within an Australian context; we therefore commonly use the Macquarie Dictionary as a general guideline when deciding on the preferred or non-preferred spelling for a term. The purpose of the Powerhouse Museum Object Name Thesaurus is to provide object name terms within an Australian context, for indexing museum collections. It also provides a controlled vocabulary that facilitates easier searching of collection databases for specific object types. A secondary purpose of a thesaurus can be to aid in the general understanding of a subject area. A thesaurus can provide a 'semantic map' by showing the inter-relationship between objects and help to provide definitions of terms. This is particularly true for the Powerhouse Museum Object Name Thesaurus which can provide a greater understanding of an object and the relationships between different types of objects.",

In this sense, it is an ambitious and novel instrument that allows the possibility of approaching heritage from different perspectives and allows the description of the same object from different disciplinary perspectives.\n\n In 1995, the Andalusian Institute of Historical Heritage from its Documentation Center, opted for the development of a documentary language capable of facilitating the processing and retrieval of information, as well as the integration of the different heritage databases that make up the System Of Historical Andalusian Heritage Information (SIPHA), resulting in the end of 1998 the publication of the Andalusian Historical Heritage Thesaurus.\n\nThe Andalusian Historical Heritage Thesaurus has the vocation to be useful to all those institutions and researchers related to the knowledge and systematization of historical heritage information, not only at the regional level but also at the national level, constituting an instrument capable of adapting to the needs Raised from the different patrimonial areas.\n\nWith the same purpose and objectives, we present the Internet version of the TPHA, which allows the consultation of the Thesaurus through its hierarchical and alphabetical structure, making it accessible to all types of users.\n\nFrom here, we invite its use and enrichment, since we are convinced that the application of the same documentary language in the systematization of the information of the Historical Heritage will have a positive impact on the knowledge and management of the same.",

    "description": "The T-SITA proposes a non-exhaustive, semantically structured, list of traits and ecological preferences. Terms are organized into a conceptual hierarchical tree with their fathers and sons ('Browse hierarchy' tab). Each term is conceptually included into its father term. For instance, the 'Reproduction type' trait term was included in the father term 'Physiology'. It means that the concept linked to the 'Reproduction type' term is included into the concept linked to the 'Physiology' term. 'Reproduction type' has two son terms: 'Asexual reproduction' and 'Sexual reproduction'. It means that the concepts linked to the 'Asexual reproduction' and 'Sexual reproduction' terms are included into the concept linked to the 'Reproduction type' term.\n\nEach term is typified by a unit. Traits and ecological preferences terms are identified by having either a numerical unit or being 'categorical'. Quantitative traits/ecological preferences are informed by numerical values and have therefore a numerical unit. For instance, the unit of the 'body length' trait term is mm. Otherwise, qualitative traits/ecological preferences are informed by textual data. To be usable, they need to be categorized into attributes, e.g. by fuzzy coding procedures (Chevenet et al. 1994). As a consequence, their unit is specified as being 'categorical'. For instance, the unit of the 'habitat' preference term is 'categorical'. 'Habitat' is categorized into several attributes, such as 'Agricultural area' or 'Wetland' terms. Such attributes appear as son terms of the habitat preference in the thesaurus hierarchy. Attributes are identified in the thesaurus by having a unit specified as being an attribute. For instance, the unit of 'Wetland' term is 'attribute'. In addition, a categorical trait or ecological preference can have multi-levels sons. For instance, the habitat preference is the father of 'Agricultural area' which is itself the father of 'Arable land', 'Fallow' and 'Perennial crop'. It was done to take into account the heterogeneous accuracy of the textual literature informing the categorical traits or preferences.",

Names for a place may include names in the vernacular language, English, other languages, historical names, names and in natural order and inverted order. Among these names, one is flagged as the preferred name. TGN is a thesaurus, compliant with ISO and NISO standards for thesaurus construction; it contains hierarchical, equivalence, and associative relationships. Note that TGN is not a GIS (Geographic Information System). While many records in TGN include coordinates, these coordinates are approximate and are intended for reference only. The focus of each TGN record is a place. There are around 912,000 places in the TGN. In the database, each place record (also called a subject) is identified by a unique numeric ID. Linked to the record for the place are names, the place's parent or position in the hierarchy, other relationships, geographic coordinates, notes, sources for the data, and place types, which are terms describing the role of the place (e.g., inhabited place and state capital). The temporal coverage of the TGN ranges from prehistory to the present and the scope is global. The TGN is a hierarchical database; its trees branch from a root called Top of the TGN hierarchies (Subject_ID: 1000000). Currently there are two TGN facets, World and Extraterrestrial Places. Under the facet World, places are arranged in hierarchies generally representing the current political and physical world, although some historical nations and empires are also included. There may be multiple broader contexts, making the TGN polyhierarchical. The primary users of the Getty vocabularies include museums, art libraries, archives, visual resource collection catalogers, bibliographic projects concerned with art, researchers in art and art history, and the information specialists who are dealing with the needs of these users. In addition, a significant number of users of the Getty vocabularies are students or members of the general public.",

    "description": "This Thesaurus is a collection of terms and concepts that survey the broad discourse on sustainability. Most definitions of sustainability, and the various disciplinary attempts to put it into practice, are not well suited in and of themselves for the actual achievement of sustainability. These definitions are descriptive of a future state of sustainability but lack a prescriptive process that presents how the transition from the present state of unsustainability to a future sustainability process may occur. The first section of this Thesaurus presents various attempts at defining sustainability. These abstract definitions have provided just enough information to inspire many different and often times conflicting attempts of reducing the level of unsustainability, which are categorized in the second section of this Thesaurus. Recently, social constructivists have entered the fray and have deemed sustainability 'an essentially contested concept', because of the many diverse approaches to the subject. The third section of this Thesaurus explores this debate and offers a way out of the unworkable conundrum in which social constructivist analysis places sustainability. Finally, the fourth section presents a definition of sustainability that describes an operational process through which sustainability may be achieved in practice. The information in this Thesaurus is no way exhaustive, but it largely represents the major issues and approaches of the sustainability debate. This document seeks to clarify the language surrounding sustainability, place current approaches in what the authors interpret as their proper contexts, and present a process that integrates scientific disciplines and local stakeholder participation into an ongoing balance-seeking process well suited to the achievement of sustainable city-regions. The Thesaurus is organized so that by reading the chapter headings as a first pass the reader will get a sense of the more detailed content within.",

Users can easily see broader, narrower, related and ‘used for’ references in a single view, without having to link to other thesaurus displays. The relationship indicators are spelled out, not abbreviated, minimizing the need to consult Help files. This format is the most commonly used thesaurus display format, and is found in the Thesaurus of ERIC Descriptors, and the Thesaurus of Psychological Index Terms. (...)

    "description": "While developing terminology for application to the moving image holdings of archives and libraries, the Moving Image Genre-Form Guide follows the traditional methods of film and television scholarship as closely as possible. The vast and steadily growing literature of genre studies has been relied upon: hundreds of books and many more articles authored on genre theory, as well as analyzing specific genres. In addition, the many genre and content lists that archives have developed over the years were examined, along with such other indexing tools as the retrospective indices to the writing on film, the terms in each volume in the American Film Institute Catalog series, and commercial guides to videos. Nonetheless, with the broad range of types of moving image works, there is no single, ready resource to appropriate for a guide to such terms in their archival application. Utilizing this range of previous work, a committee within the Motion Picture/Broadcasting/Recorded Sound Division has compiled a comprehensive, practical guide to moving image genre and form terminology ever created, covering some 150 terms, all fully defined and exemplified. However, in addition to fulfilling the needs of archivists and librarians, a guide to genre-form terms must also satisfy such other interested groups as moving image scholars and filmmakers. In order to be widely comprehensible to researchers, a guide should offer terms and definitions conforming to general classification practice. Since searches of online databases will be increasingly conducted over the internet, instead of with the assistance of reference librarians, the Moving Image Genre-Form Guide aims to promote the likelihood of outside researchers finding the desired bibliographic records through use of the basic terms in the field. With each term, we have provided a definition, describing conventions of story construction, character types, and setting, and, as necessary, additional definitional notes that indicate related or overlapping genres, and other considerations when applying the term. For nearly every genre and form, a variety of examples from different periods and nations are given. The examples are meant to be both typical of the genre as well as to indicate its breath, themes, and significant sub-types. The very comprehensiveness that is the hallmark of the Moving Image Genre-Form Guide will give it additional value beyond those involved in cataloging and inventorying moving image works. The issues encountered in developing such a guide encompass many of the same problems that academia tackles in classes and research. Just as the Moving Image Genre- Form Guide has followed the literature of genre studies, this guide may also be able to make a contribution to such scholarship. Since the archival perspective frequently extends beyond some of the more abstract, theoretical discourse and the possibilities traditionally recognized for critical generic analysis, scholars may benefit from a project that necessarily applies to all forms and periods, with a greater emphasis on marginal genres. The Moving Image Genre-Form Guide may be of value in pinpointing categories that are worthy of further study but have been previously neglected or overlooked, as genres that have not received critical recognition become evident in the cataloging of archival holdings. There are entire undertheorized areas that must be incorporated, such as genres specific to television, from Home shopping to Public access. To facilitate recognition from researchers, we have included categories for some little-known genres that represent significant, unavoidable generic groups of archival holdings. Thus the Moving Image Genre-Form Guide can achieve a positive and exciting exchange between the academic and archival communities, in addition to its practical value as an indexing tool to scholars searching the archives.",

They are discussed here from the point of view of fundamental properties, when the dimensions of an object become as small as certain characteristic distances (coherence length, mean free path, ...).\n\nFinally, the third axis extends the concept of \"soft matter\" to biological systems. Themes range from complex systems to living tissues, from liquid crystals to foams, to polymers or granular systems. These physical studies at the interface touch physico-chemistry and biology.",

Terms accepted for indexing and searching are printed in upper case letters and are called descriptors; synonyms appear in lower case letters and are not valid descriptors. Symbols appearing under descriptors are used to direct the searcher to a preferred term, clarify meaning, and indicate relationships of terms. Some proper names of countries and international organizations appear in the thesaurus as identifiers, and 'pubtypes' identify types of documents.

    "description": "The development of a new scheme for classifying the more than 7,000 documents on reading in the ERIC/CRIER data collection is described. An original scheme, developed in the early days of the clearinghouse, provided a means for listing documents in any of 45 broad subject categories in the field of reading and for identification by grade level. The system was found to be inadequate in that it did not permit sufficient precision for effective retrieval. The newly developed classification scheme proposes 27 classes into which documents can be divided. Each of these uses a numerical schedule which includes subclasses and provides means of adding more as needed. Further classification by grade level, source of material, type of material, and date of publication is also provided through a faceting technique. To facilitate use of the classification scheme, an index was developed which alphabetically lists terms included in the scheme. Testing of the scheme by ERIC/CRIER personnel was carried out on a 200-document sample, and comparisons were made of their notations. Overall agreement of better than a designated standard of 60 percent was determined for 77 percent of the documents, with higher agreement noted in individual parts of the notation. Illustrations of aspects of the scheme are included.",

Application of the new German spelling in terms of German and foreign language components. Application of professional reference books, generalcyclopedia, Duden dictionary.

The thesaurus is a documentation language devised for the purpose of analysing works, articles, reports and other documents referring to the problems of mass communication according to the particular medium to which they refer: books, the press, records, films, radio or television. While its main purpose is to characterize the information in a sufficiently precise manner to allow post-storage retrieval of the documents containing it, it has the secondary purpose of enabling queries to be expressed in a form which will match the information available. In addition, by providing a valid basis for the exchange of data between documentation systems, it will allow national or international networks to operate in a fully satisfactory consistent manner. In the social sciences and the humanities there are still relatively few fields in which a documentation language has been tried out in a systematic manner. A thesaurus on communication can reasonably be expected to make a contribution to scientific communication, and it would be a pity if full use were not made of the facilities it provides in this regard to both research workers and practicians, in a sector which social changes have brought particularly to the fore.",

A wide range of documents and reports relevant to LIC were selected, catalogued and indexed from open literature as part of a feasibility study on an Information Analysis Centre (IAC). The Thesaurus of Engineering and Scientific Terms (TEST) was used initially for indexing terms but it became apparent that the subject matter required a broader range of terms in areas not covered comprehensively by TEST. Catalogers added terms as needed and gradually a 'working vocabulary' of something less than one thousand descriptors emerged. This original word list was edited following the rules and conventions adopted for the construction of TEST. Undesirable terms were removed, new ones were added and all hierarchical relationships and cross-references were entered and checked. The present thesaurus contains 950 descriptors and 225 USE references in the Thesaurus of Terms. A more detailed discussion of the process of construction of the LIC Thesaurus (LICT) is available in a separate report. LICT borrows heavily from TEST in format, rules and conventions followed and in many of the descriptors listed. The instructions and explanations about the use of LICT have been patterned after those in TEST.",

One was originated by Engineers Joint Council to revise the first edition of its Thesaurus of Engineering Terms (1964); the other, by the Department of Defense, under the sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research and known as Project LEX, which had as its mission the development of the first Department of Defense technical thesaurus. The large number of related and overlapping interests of these two separate projects soon motivated a merging of the efforts. The need for commonality in information systems and in reduction of communication barriers was also a driving force, as was the economic advantage of pooling resources, especially available technical personnel. Preparation and presentation agreements were readily reached and a joint working arrangement made for the two projects to join forces in one operation. Hence, this single work, Thesaurus of Engineering and Scientific Terms, which is also available on magnetic tape, is a thesaurus for both Engineers Joint Council and the Department of Defense.",

The types of organisations that would find the Glossary of value include: local governments; State and Commonwealth government departments; professional groups; processing, storage and transport industries; other large private sector organisations; hospitals, educational institutions, etc; and community organisations. (...) Confusion in emergency management often arises from a misunderstanding over words\n\nbecause emergency management is at the nexus of many fields. There is also an increasing proliferation and duplication of terms and definitions, as the emergency management field itself is still evolving and adapting itself to new and changing contexts. The Glossary provides information on the range of terms and definitions encountered in emergency management, and may, in the future, lead to a consensus on terms and definitions. This Glossary does not present new or different definitions of terms, but draws together definitions from many existing sources. It also suggests a set of core terms (...).",

    "description": "The recovery of information has been and continues to be a key issue in information science since its emergence as a scientific field to date.With the advances of science and technology and the era of the information society, the Internet and the vertiginous proliferation of information, Thesauri are essential tools in the search and access to information.The consistency, precision and relevance of the information are basic qualities in this process and depend mainly on thesauri.\n\nAmong the few thesauri of information science in the world, we highlight that of the United States, today's Association for Information Science and Technology - ASIS & T, formerly American Society for Information Science and Technology, ASIS & T Thesaurus of Information Science, Technology and Librarianship, in Third Edition, 2005, edited by Alice Redmond-Neal and Marjorie MK Hlava.\n\nThe Brazilian Thesaurus of Information Science has a wide application not only for indexers, but also researchers, professors and information professionals in general. It is a fundamental instrument for the consistency of terminology and vocabulary of a given field of knowledge.\n\nIbict owed this work to those who deal with issues of documentary language, since the initiative to build a thesaurus in information science, 1989, was not published, was restricted to internal use and did not continue.\n\nA work of this magnitude requires knowledge of the area, experience and arduous theoretical and conceptual effort of many years of dedication. It was left to Lena Vania Ribeiro Pinheiro, a researcher and teacher at Ibict, to meet this challenge, with the collaboration of Helena Dodd Ferrez, principal author of the thesaurus for museum collections.\n\nIn the elaboration of the thesaurus, the authors had the collaboration of researchers and teachers, as well as information science technicians, with whom they maintained productive dialogues, which contributed a lot to the making of this instrument. Also important were the sources they resorted to, like other thesauri and dictionaries, all identified in this publication.\n\nWith great pride, Ibict launches this thesaurus, encompassing some 1,800 terms, most with an English and Spanish version, complemented by definitions, in the expectation that the Brazilian Thesaurus of Information Science will play a central role in the information retrieval in Brazil And in Portuguese-speaking countries.",

    "description": "The ULAN is a structured vocabulary currently containing around 293,000 names and other information about artists. Names in ULAN may include given names, pseudonyms, variant spellings, names in multiple languages, and names that have changed over time (e.g., married names). Among these names, one is flagged as the preferred name. Although it is displayed as a list, ULAN is structured as a thesaurus, compliant with ISO and NISO standards for thesaurus construction; it contains hierarchical, equivalence, and associative relationships. The focus of each ULAN record is an artist. Currently there are around 120,000 artists in the ULAN. In the database, each artist record (also called a subject in this manual) is identified by a unique numeric ID. Linked to each artist record are names, related artists, sources for the data, and notes. The temporal coverage of the ULAN ranges from Antiquity to the present and the scope is global. Although originally intended only for use by Getty projects, the broader art information community outside the Getty expressed a need to use ULAN for cataloging and retrieval. The Getty thus distributed ULAN for broader use according to the tenets previously established for the construction and maintenance of the AAT: Its scope includes names needed to catalog and retrieve information about the visual arts and architecture; it is based on terminology that is current, warranted for use by authoritative literary sources, and validated by use in the scholarly art and architectural history community; and it is compiled and edited in response to the needs of the user community. Originally constructed as a simple alphabetized \"union list\" of clustered artist names and biographies, in order to make it consistent with the AAT and TGN, in the late 1990s ULAN was brought into compliance with national and international standards for thesaurus construction. Its scope was broadened to include corporate bodies such as architectural firms and repositories of art, which may have hierarchical levels.",

When the division does not articulate into classes, the last two digits are zeros.\n\nThe legal sources considered for the classification are the Constitution of the Republic, the Civil Code and the special legislation. In addition, in order to capture certain phenomena not attributable to typical legal forms, reference has been made to case law.\n\nThis classification is updated with the regulations in force on 31 December 2004.

ThESS is born and grows in relation to library acquisitions and the necessity to express the contents of the books to favor searches by subject.\n\nIt is used in the following functions: Cataloging Acquired Library Material: Thesaurus terms are assigned to each bibliographic record as keywords and combined by catalogers in cohesive subject strings to express the subject of the book. Document Retrieval: Thesaurus terms enable those who seek to retrieve documents, either by combining them with a search mask or by scrolling through the lists. Terminology-Conceptual Analysis in Research Processes: The relationship between the terms of the thesaurus allows to enrich the terminological heritage of a field or a research topic, guiding other words related to meaning used in the library catalog or any other tool . This thesaurus usage is widely presented in the Information Literacy courses of the Laurea and Master's Degree courses at the LIUC University. ThESS is born with a priority reference to the needs of the study and research community formed by the students, researchers and faculty of the Faculty of Business Economics, Management Engineering and Law of the Carlo Cattaneo - LIUC University. It can also be useful to librarians, catalogers, information specialists who manage and bibliographic and documentary collections of the same disciplinary areas. ThESS is a multidisciplinary thesaurus, one-hierarchical, organized based on categories of about 7000 terms. Includes proper names.

    "description": "All of us are frequently confronted with the problem of identifying musical instruments and their components correctly, whether in the process of defining a part that has been damaged or restored, or trying to transmit our knowledge to school children, students or our academic colleagues. Occasionally this task is a distinct challenge due to the lack of a standardized terminology in the field of organology.\n\nRecognizing this fact, the Brasswind Terminology Working Group, which consists of four brass scholars at this point (Stewart Carter, Arnold Myers, Bradley Strauchen and myself), tries to develop a coherent terminology for brasswind instruments and their components in English. Our approach differs from hierarchical systems, such as the Hornbostel-Sachs classification - which is a 'downward' system - in its 'upward' orientation. We derive our terminology from the detailed inspection and delineation of an instrument in its musical, social, historical and technological contexts, rather than its classification according to general characteristics.\n\nThe primary goal of the Brasswind Terminology Working Group is the standardization of brasswind terminology to create a commonly accepted, precise language, which eventually can be used by anyone concerned with this instrument type (organologists, musicologists, museum curators, instrument makers and others who have need to refer to these instruments).\n\nWe hope that this project will stimulate the development of similar working groups for other types of instruments, and in languages other than English. A long-term goal is to create a generally accepted terminology for the field of organology that applies to instruments and their parts in a clear and consistent manner.",

    "description": "To classify maps, atlases, and globes most advantageously in a collection extensively used by geographers, historians, economists, technicians or other specialists and students, it is believed that the categories to be considered, in order of importance, are: (1) Area, (2) Subject, and (3) Date, with (4) Author, frequently necessary. When these four categories are insufficient to differentiate between maps in the collection, a fifth, Title, may be used. A sixth, Physical form, must be taken into account in filing globes, relief maps, maps mounted on rigid board or equipped with sticks or rods. The area-subject classification of maps corresponds to the classification of books by subject. The addition of date and, when necessary, author (or publisher), usually completes the differentiation of each map from every other map. Thus classified, a map has a single specific filing position relative to all the other maps; the flexible classification permits unlimited intercalation of new maps in their logical positions, regardless of the chance order of accession into the collection. It is believed that the notation which has been adopted, in which area is represented by numbers, and subject is represented by letters, gains merit from this obvious separation. The classification system needs at the outset to provide the framework for inclusion of every likely map subject, though it need not give an absolute location for the less common subjects. This forms a contrast with the subject heading list, which is infinitely expansive by nature.",

Such products include those used in the diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease or injury in humans.\n\nThe main purpose of the GMDN is to provide health authorities and regulators, health care providers, medical device manufacturers and suppliers, conformity assessment bodies and others with a single generic naming system that will support patient safety.\n\nThe GMDN is used for: Data exchange between manufacturers, regulators and healthcare authorities; Exchange of post-market vigilance information; Supporting inventory control in hospitals; Purchasing and supply chain management.\n\nMedical device experts from around the world (manufacturers, healthcare authorities and regulators) compiled the GMDN, based on the international standard ISO 15225. The work was mandated by the European Commission in order to provide the necessary tool to carry out the implementation of the Medical Devices Directive, including the European databank for medical devices, Eudamed.\n\nThe GMDN meets the need to identify medical devices at the global level, as identified by the Global Harmonization Task Force (GHTF) and is now used by over 50 national medical device regulators. The GMDN is managed by the GMDN Agency, a non-profit organization, which reports to its Board of Trustees, that represents medical device regulators and industry.\n\nThe GMDN Agency updates the GMDN utilizing member change requests, to add a new device terms to the GMDN. The decisions are made by an international expert team on how the new term is to be described, according to ISO 15225. The GMDN is available in English and 24 other languages.\n\nThe GMDN Agency releases new and updated GMDN terms on a daily basis, on their interactive website, the GMDN Database. Information in the form of a 5 digit numeric GMDN Code is cross-referenced to a precisely defined descriptive Preferred Term, with which all specific devices have substantially similar generic features.",

To avoid misunderstandings due to this situation and to facilitate such exchanges, it is advisable to select terms to be used in various languages or in various countries to express the same concept and to establish definitions providing satisfactory equivalents for the various terms in different languages. The work of the ISO Sub-Committee charged with the study of the Vocabulary was based on various international documents issued by Sub-Committees of ISO Technical Committee 95 and on national drafts or standards. ISO 5138 consists of several sections published separately, each section dealing with a category of office machines. The numbering of these sections, beginning with 01, depends on the chronological order of their development. A basic classification of machines has been introduced at the beginning of each section, before the vocabulary proper.",

Some other open access collections, such as music and reference collections in specialised reading rooms, have their own schemes.) This edition represents current practice and interpretation; inspection of the shelves will reveal classes superseded by more detailed subdivision or abandoned entirely, while policy on some of the less specific categories or on new areas of study will be found to have evolved over time.

Currently, the seven 'top level' terms and the vast majority of the 'mid level' terms (categories) come directly from the AAT while all of the 'bottom level' terms and a few of the 'mid level' terms are derived from AMNH keywords.

The IST includes relationships between keywords and phrases such as broader terms, narrower terms, preferred terms, non-preferred terms or related terms. The purpose of these relationships is to help indexers/classifiers to find the best subject keywords to describe the \"aboutness\" of documents. Also, these relationships can help searchers by providing preferred and related subject terms to use in a search.\n\nThe IST is a bilingual thesaurus of subject terms describing the work of INAC. It includes more than 2800 terms in English and more that 2900 terms in French, including almost 1300 preferred terms in each language. The IST conforms to internationally accepted standards and conventions for thesaurus construction (i.e. Guidelines for the construction, format and management of monolingual controlled vocabularies (ANSI/NISO Z39.19-2005), Guidelines for the establishment and development of monolingual thesauri (ISO 2788-1986) and the Guidelines for the establishment and development of multilingual thesauri (ISO 5964-1985)).",

The extended version (SKB-E) is used in libraries with a more specialized subject book. The notations of both variants of the system are given in the review magazines of the Catholic library work, the 'bookprofiles' and the 'media profiles', for each revised title. A 'Stich- und Schlagwortregister' was published on the Sachbuch system. On the one hand, it helps in the librarianship in the consultation of readers. It also makes it easier to classify newly acquired books and other media into the relevant subject groups. The register provides, for example, information on the question of where books and media are classified as 'age'. Through the use of appropriate library software the classification of the newly acquired titles into the subject groups and the information service in the library are made much easier.

The present publication is not intended to add one to the number, but rather to offer a way of escape for those who shrink from the intricacies and difficulties of the elaborate systems, and to substitute for painstaking analytical classification a simple arrangement which it is believed is better adapted to be practically useful in  a library, while doing away with most of the work involved in carrying out one of these schemes.",

In the Temporary Table of SMA Activity-End Documents were identified: (1) a function that is the Management of State Environmental Policy, 6 (six) subfunctions corresponding to the large areas of operation of the SMA, 18 activities developed by the various organs With these instruments, SMA will reduce to the essential the documents accumulated in its archives, without prejudice to the safeguard of the acts Administrative, constitutive and extinguishing rights, information indispensable to the decision-making process and the preservation of institutional memory. In 2003, SMA began to manage documents related to Environmental Activities, observing the current norms and directives of the central body of SAESP, the State Archives, since then the SMA has been carrying out actions aimed at implementing a document management system Compatible with the new organizational paradigms and in accordance with the current legislation, covering its activities end, in a pioneering attitude, since adopted before such providence became mandatory. The Technical Group, established by the Resolution No. CC-33 of April 8, 2004, of the Civil House to carry out the planning and strategy for the implementation of the Single Protocol, For the adaptation of the requirements of the application of the System, as well as the elaboration of a strategic plan for its implementation, depends on an exhaustive knowledge of the documentary production generated and accumulated by the organs of the state administration, reason why it selected some organs to participate in the pilot project , Among which is the SMA. The elaboration of the Classification Plan and the Temporary Table of Documents counted on the involvement and collaboration of technicians from the different areas of the SMA. The joint action of these professionals was of fundamental importance for the accomplishment of the work. With the application of the Tables of Temporality of Documents we are performing the elimination of documents, a procedure that is part of the management of documents and aims at the rationalization of space, reduction of documentary mass, rationalization of production and document flow, agility in the recovery of Documents and information, administrative efficiency and preservation of memory.",

    "description": "In creating TUT we relied extensively on existing finding aids to generate terms and tested the thesaurus against a broad range of record series, thus ensuring that the vocabulary would have literary warrant. We wanted a system that was easy to learn and use and that did not impose a too-limited context on the descriptors. The most difficult and important task was arriving at an organizational scheme that is not tied to the organizational structure of this university. The university's structure and delegation of tasks is in a constant state of flux. A system based on the status quo would not necessarily work in ten years or even for records ten years old. The thesaurus that we created will describe the activities and functions of the university regardless of who performed them. We also have no desire to duplicate the physical arrangement which makes possible easy retrieval of records by office of origin. What resulted from our efforts is a four-part subject thesaurus that describes the people, functions, and activities of the university. The first section, Hierarchy of university Terms (HUT), is for functions and activities. The second, Administrative and academic departments, Schools, and Centers (ASC) is for names of these organizational units. The third, GEOgraphic locations (GEO) is for names of buildings and campus locations. (Although these two are of only local value we have included them to show how we handled the problem of specific names and titles that are necessary for description, especially to modify university activities and to limit searches. They also provide a pattern for creating similar lists for other institutions.) The fourth part, FORM, is a list of record types or forms that is used primarily as a device to narrow searches. (A search for information about a student government event can prevent retrieval of posters, for example.)",

The scope of this thesaurus includes not only environmental and biomedical sciences, but also the physical sciences with emphasis placed on chemistry. Specific chemical compounds are not included; only classes of chemicals are given. To adhere to this level of classification, drugs and pesticides are identified by class rather than by specific chemical name. An attempt was also made to expand the areas of sociology and economics. Terminology dealing with law, demography, and geography was expanded. Proper names of languages and races were excluded. Geographic terms were expanded to include proper names for oceans, continents, major lakes, rivers, and islands. Political divisions were added to allow for proper names of countries and states. With such a broad scope, terminology for specific sciences does not provide for indexing to the lowest levels in plant, animal, or chemical classifications.",

Personal visits were made to Catholic Universities; many librarians and scholars were interviewed; extensive correspondence was exchanged with religious orders; specialized institutes were contacted; all applicable library science, and data-processing literature was analyzed. Two consistent responses emerged from the preponderance of respondents. First, 'There is no existing, broad-scope, professional-quality, Catholic-information, classification system!' Second, 'We sure need a practical, classification system to: promptly and efficiently process the overwhelming flood of incoming information; facilitate its entrance into the electronic era!'

    "description": "The Masonic Classification herewith presented is the result of  some twenty-two years of practical experience in the largest masonic library in the world — the Library of the Supreme Council, 33rd Degree at Washington. This Library, in addition to its thousands of items on Freemasonry and related societies, contains also thousands upon thousands of general works in all branches of literature. These latter works are classified according to the well-known Dewey Decimal System, but this system provides no classification of freemasonry, assigning one class only to the subject, which class is practically incapable of subdivision. The scheme which I have devised and which is in successful practical operation, provides for nearly four hundred classes and sub-classes.\n\nPractically all masonic libraries contain much general literature, but as they specialize on freemasonry, it becomes necessary to provide some system which will allow of their classification independently of the general library. Many libraries use the Dewey Decimal System, and I have devised the present scheme to prevent confusion, not only in the classification, but also in the catalogue card number, the book label number, the shelf guide number, and in various other ways, the letter \"M\" (Masonry) arbitrarily prefixed to the digits, always indicating the card, the book, its label, and the shelf-guide, as of masonic import.\n\nThe entire range of masonic literature is divided into ten great classes, somewhat similar to Dewey's ten great classes of general literature. These ten classes are subdivided again and again to suit the requirements of the literature on a given subject. For example, if we have a general history of freemasonry, it goes in class M10. If it is a history of Freemasonry in Europe, it goes in class M17.940, the M17, indicating that it is a geographical division of masonic history, and the 940, indicating that it is a history of Freemasonry in Europe, the 940 being Dewey's notation for Europe. Again, take the class M20, which is Customs and Paraphernalia. Any general work on the subject would go in this class, but if the library possessed literature on the Obituary Rites of freemasonry, it would go in class M20.01; if it had works on Paraphernalia, they would go in class M21; Jewels and Medals would go in M22, and so on.",

The database contains currently some 40,000 items drawn from 1,800 publications, with new ones being added on a continuous basis. (...) The Glossary complements and in many cases draws from the International Electrotechnical Vocabulary (IEV) published by TC 1 (Terminology). The IEV is the authoritative source for 'standardized IEC terminology' organized into some 80 subject areas. The Glossary is of a more limited nature. Its definitions relate to the source standard from which they are extracted. A term can therefore have different meanings, depending on the context in which it is used. The Glossary should be considered as an informative document as the terms and definitions have been separated from the context in which they are applied.",

A cornerstone in this effort constitutes the precise and complete description of the fundamental entities within this domain in terms of formal ontologies.\n\nHowever, biomedical ontology development often still do not adhere to basic design principles: For example, even very low-level domain terms often lack precise and unambiguous (logical) definitions. This impedes the move towards semantic standardization that is needed for their intended knowledge management task. Rather, it leads to inconsistencies, fragmentation and overlap both within and inbetween different ontologies.\n\nIn light of this we introduce BioTop, a top-domain ontology that provides definitions for the foundational entities of biomedicine as a basic vocabulary to unambiguously describe facts in this domain. BioTop can furthermore serve as top-level model for creating new ontologies for more specific domains or as aid for aligning or improving existing ones.\n\nBioTop is founded upon formal design principles (as propagated by the OBO Foundry initiative) and implemented in OWL-DL, the standard ontology language on the Semantic Web. BioTop makes use of the whole range of constructors of OWL-DL. The use of OWL-DL makes it possible to apply description logics reasoners for maintaining consistency by continuous classficiation during development and to automatically infer its hierarchical structure. To this end, we try to fully define as much classes as possible (in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions).",

The advantages of CERIF are: its neutral architecture; the data model can be implemented [relational, object-oriented, information retrieval (including WWW)]; the process model can be implemented [DBMS and query (centralised or distributed), HTML web / harvesting / IR-query, advanced knowledge-based technology].\n\nBut interoperation requires a structured schema. Today CERIF is used as a model for implementation of a standalone CRIS (but interoperation ready), as a model to define the wrapper around a legacy non-CERIF CRIS to allow homogeneous access to heterogeneous systems and as a definition of a data exchange format to create a common data warehouse from several CRIS.",

The merging has been performed both on conceptual and formal basis. Coinciding concepts in the different thesauri have been identified and scored. Like in other multilingual thesauri, e. g. Infoterra EnVoc, a neutral alphanumerical notation allows the identification of a concept independently on the user's language.\n\nThe links with the original thesauri are ensured by the respective identifiers or code notations. Following the identification of the coinciding concepts, a selection was made by the experts of the National Focal Points of the organisations involved. The resulting 6.562 terms have been arranged in a classification scheme made of 3 super-groups, 30 groups plus 5 accessory, instrumental groups. Each descriptor has been arranged in a hierarchical structure headed by a Top Term. The level of poly-hierarchy, i.e. the allocation of a descriptor to more than one group, has been kept to a minimum. Further, to allow a thematic retrieval of terms thematically related but scattered in different groups, a set of 40 themes have been agreed upon with the EEA and each descriptor has been assigned to as many themes as necessary. Thus, the user can access the thesaurus through the group- hierarchical list, through the thematic list or through the alphabetical list. As a complement to the hierarchical 'vertical' relations, an exhaustive series of strong 'horizontal' relations between terms (RT, Related Terms) have been introduced. A progressive Line Number has been assigned to each descriptor of the systematic list, in order to help the user of the lists to identify the descriptor in the different lists. The Line Number is merely a neutral identifier for the present version. The GEMET size, formerly figured at about 200000 descriptors, rose to more than 5.000 in the course of merging, due to the limited overlapping between the different thesauri, to constraints of the selection work carried out by the parental organisations and to a few new additions, mainly from CDS indexing work. The present version 2001* of GEMET is the result of a close collaboration between CNR and UBA under contract and supervision of the ETC/CDS. It presents 5.298 descriptors, including 109 Top Terms, and 1.264 synonyms in English. The 5.524 terms belonging to the parental thesauri and not included in GEMET, constitute an accessory alphabetical list of free terms. GEMET has been developed as an indexing, retrieval and control tool for the European Topic Centre on Catalogue of Data Sources (ETC/CDS) and the European Environment Agency (EEA), Copenhagen.",

    "description": "Launched in 1997, Uniclass, the classification for the construction industry, is the UK implementation of BS ISO 12006-2, providing a structured approach to classifying the building information by organising information based upon common characteristics. The recent developments and wide-adoption of BIM to manage information across the project timeline, has meant the need for a unified approach to classification, ensuring that information is universally structured regardless of the author. This lead to a review of Uniclass and the development of Uniclass2.\"\n\n\"A classification system is an essential tool for organising information. Without an agreed, comprehensive system for organising construction information it will be impossible to ensure interoperability between different information systems, design tools, and facilities management tools, with data entered once and re-used several times through the process. A construction classification system must include buildings, infrastructure and integrated project and office management. It must be able to map project information from the initial concept through brief, detailed design, construction, handover and facility operation and maintenance. To fully adopt the BIM process it is important to organise such information systematically and consistently. Uniclass 2 has been developed to produce a classification system for structuring information that is freely available for all participants throughout the life cycle of a project and beyond, which is endorsed by all construction and property bodies and professional institutions. It is dynamic, available online in various formats and managed by a team of experts who will monitor requests, update and control versioning.",

    "description": "The 'Subject Areas' panel on each article page displays a set of terms selected for that article based on its content. The Subject Areas belong to a thesaurus of over 10,000 terms initially built for us over the course of 2012 by Access Innovations, taking into account the controlled vocabulary of classification terms that had been in use in PLOS Editorial Manager. The entire corpus of PLOS articles was analysed to ensure that the thesaurus covers the research domain comprehensively.\n\nSpecific terms are associated with articles by Machine Aided Indexing (MAI) which identifies text strings in the articles and matches them to Subject Area terms from the thesaurus. The output ranks the matches in order of frequency of hits within the text of the article and the top eight terms are selected for display. Whereas previously the eight terms were presented in alphabetical order, we are introducing weightings to the Subject Area panel, such that the order of Subject Areas will reflect the frequency of hits in the MAI process. This new presentation will be introduced progressively, beginning with the main Article tab.\n\nThe MAI process uses a Rulebase to guide Subject Area selection. Whereas identifying a phrase such as 'Retinitis pigmentosa' is relatively straightforward for software, the issue is more complex for a word such as 'Sodium' where the relevant Subject Area might be 'Voltage-gated sodium channels', any of several sodium compounds or even just 'Sodium' the element. The rule for terms such as 'Sodium' are therefore compound and include conditional statements to disambiguate these different contexts. While the vast majority of terms are effectively indexed there remain ambiguities for some terms and part of our work is to continue to identify these cases and modify the Rulebase accordingly.\n\nThe Subject Area terms are related to each other with a system of broader/narrower term relationships. The thesaurus structure is a polyhierarchy, so for example the Subject Area 'White blood cells' has two broader terms 'Blood cells' and 'Immune cells'. At its deepest the hierarchy is ten tiers deep, with all terms tracking back to one or more of the top tier Subject Areas, such as 'Biology and life sciences' or 'Social sciences'.\n\nThe Subject Area terms can be used to filter PLOS content via the Subject-specific option in Advanced Search. The MAI Rulebase accommodates synonyms, so a Subject-specific Search for 'Highly active antiretroviral therapy' will retrieve articles based on MAI matches to 'HAART' (a known synonym) as well as 'Highly active antiretroviral therapy' in one step. Additionally, because we select the most frequently MAI-indexed Subject Areas for each article the Search returns articles where the Subject Area in question ranks highly enough to be included in the top eight MAI-retrieved terms, so is of relatively high significance, whereas a query term in an “All fields” search will return every article that contains even a single match to the query term.\n\nThe hierarchical nature of the thesaurus also enhances article retrieval in Search. Not only does Search retrieve all articles specifically indexed by MAI with the query Subject Area term in question, but it also retrieves all articles specifically indexed with any Subject Area term that sits deeper into the hierarchy than the query Subject Area term, but on the same broader/narrower term path. Thus, in the 'White blood cells' example, queries for either 'Blood cells' or 'Immune cells' will return all articles indexed with 'White blood cells'.\n\nThe Subject Area terms on all article pages are hyperlinked and following the link returns a listing of all articles to which that Subject Area term applies. Subject Area terms can also be used as the basis for Saved Searches, RSS feeds and PLOS ONE customized Journal Alerts.\n\nThe content of the PLOS thesaurus and the Rulebase that governs the application of Subject Areas to the articles is constantly under review. We incorporate analysis of the Subject Area panel 'feedback' clicks into this review process, and are always happy to receive specific input on Subject Area terms and their application by email. We update the thesaurus behind the PLOS sites several times each year.",

The preferred concept bacillus anthracis, for example, has defined associations to the concept Anthrax (the disease caused by the target organism) and to the concept Anthrax vaccines (the prevention for the disease). This organism term is 'treed' in the polyhierarchy as both a soilborne bacillus organism and as a biological agent. The parent concept Anthrax has child concepts Cutaneous anthrax, Gastrointestinal anthrax, and Pulmonary anthrax. Thus the utilization of this cluster of concepts on a website or within an application enables a rich retrieval of all anthrax-related information. (...) The Controlled Health Thesaurus is a public health view of pertinent concepts from the National Library of Medicine’s Metathesaurus. Additional concepts needed to cover the public health domain are being added and will be advanced to NLM. CDC Research revealed that the National Library of Medicine’s Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) provided the broadest coverage of concepts for public health. Additional concepts from other UMLS vocabularies, such as the Computerized Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects (CRISP), Alcohol and Other Drug Thesaurus (AOD), and Library of Congress Subject Headings will be utilized as needed. CDC is leveraging the expertise of its subject matter experts and its public health partners to add additional public health concepts. Requirements for Thesaurus structuring and metadata selection came from the ANSI/NISO Z39.19 Guidelines for the Construction, Format, and Management of Monolingual Thesauri.

The thesaurus can be used as a lookup resource through this website and also as a software service where the terms can be retrieved directly through your own application. LoB is a young project and community contribution will ensure that it will be improved. (...) The thesaurus is structured based on the Simple Knowledge Organisation System (SKOS). Some of the main principle of that system are: We define concepts (not words) to avoid common problems such as when different communities use different words for the same idea. Each concept can have a number of labels (language words) which refer to the concept, with one of them being a recommended label (preferred label) and the rest being the alternative labels. Concepts are organised from the more general ones, the broader concepts, to the more specific ones, the narrower (broader / narrower relationship). A narrower term should always describe a concept which is included in the parent concept. For example, adzes is a narrower concept of tools and equipment because all adzes are tools. (...) LoB concepts are described in the so-called scope notes, which aim to give both a brief definition of each concept as well as a broader indication of what the concept is about, together with some historical information where this is known and relevant. (...) Where possible we have matched our concepts with concepts from the Getty AAT. Our intention is to submit LoB concepts to the AAT where corresponding terms do not exist. (...) The thesaurus is meant to be used as part of a documentation system. We recognise the value of the CIDOC-CRM in the documentation of cultural heritage. For this reason we have chosen our top concepts to match CIDOC-CRM entities so that their narrower concept hierarchies can be used as E55 Type for these entities in a documentation system.

The vocabulary of Anglo-Saxon England is presented within ordered categories. Ideally, the reader should approach the materials of the TOE by subject rather than through the alphabetic index of the printed edition. Roget-owners have long been accustomed to begin with a word and, by trying a few locations listed in the index, find the vocabulary group wanted. Moreover, for inclusiveness they trade detailed information. Should a word's precise meaning be wanted, a dictionary is needed. Most conceptually-organized thesauri tend therefore to be used by native speakers of a language, who know the meanings of the words scanned. Less assured speakers may turn to those alphabetically-organized thesauri where they will find more help with meaning but far fewer words. In the TOE any small group of items listed together as sharing a component of meaning resembles the strings of words that make up the entries of an alphabetically-organized thesaurus, but they are embedded within an inclusive conceptual scheme. The provision of brief indications of meaning at all levels of this scheme looks back behind Roget, to the way in which Wilkins supplies notions and words, where word-senses follow on from ideas explained. Thus, this thesaurus incorporates information about word meaning and could be described as an inside-out dictionary, with meanings first and then words.",

    "description": "With this project idea thesaurA - the name represents the feminist transformation of the male term 'thesaurus' and accentuated by the capitalization of the feminine ending the Austrian-specific approach - a concept was adopted which had already been implemented several times internationally: already in the 70s The American Thesaurus 'On Equal Terms' had been published, the first German-language thesaurus was published in 1994 by the Cologne 'FrauenMediaTurm'.\n\nLanguage and language behavior in a society are, as is well known, characterized by power structures and governance processes. This also means that linguistic norms represent linguistic actions. The use of language in our society is based on male values ​​and at the same time discriminates against women in several ways: he is sexist. Since keyword catalogs and thesauri are basically based on compilations of predominantly natural language terms, the conventional spelling of conventional Austrian documentation facilities is sexist.\n\nBut also in other respects an anachronistic and useless hostile state is to be established. Within the last twenty years, in the context of the New Women's Movement and the influence of feminist criticism, social awareness about gender relations has been at least a reflection process. This has also resulted in different intensity reactions in science and in daily politics. The constantly growing amount of women-oriented literature, however, is opposed to a catchword which is not suitable for exhaustively evaluating feminist / woman-specific documentation material.\n\nThis deficit is to be countered by proposing suggestions and providing assistance in the implementation of three sociolinguistic principles. The linguistic visualization of women is to be enforced by eliminating the universally argued male language form. Thus, if the content of a document refers to women and men, a codification must be carried out, which makes both sexes visible. Here, however, a gender specification is meant not only with regard to person names such as \"asylum seekers\" or \"asylum seekers\" or \"female youngsters\" or \"male youngsters\", but also as a feminine innovation in the case of composites such as \"workers' Workers 'movement' and 'Christianity'. (...)\n\nThe first Austrian women's thesaurus as a reference book for orientation in the field of women's and gender studies contains 467 pages and consists of a manual, the main part with about 3000 terms, a permutation register and an index of the subjects according to subject group systematics; As additional documentary tools, four special lists - professional groups, form keywords, geographics and time-lapse words - are attached.\n\nThe target groups of thesaurA include the content developers in both institutionalized documentation institutions and libraries, as well as in smaller specialized women's libraries, archives and documentation centers. However, the vocabulary should also be available to the users of these institutions in order to assist in the effective search for information.",

The LBC is the newest classification system applied in the world today. It appeared in 1960-s, whereas Melwil Dewey’s Decimal Classification (DDC) was submitted in 1876, the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) – in 1895–1905, the Library of Congress Classification (LCC) – in 1912, S. R. Ranganathan’s Colon Classification (CC) – in 1936. By its semantic power the LBC can be compared with the UDC. The LBC belongs to the combinative systems (as well as the UDC); its capability cannot be measured in the quantity of main schedules divisions because the quantity of combinations with divisions of auxiliary classification tables is immeasurable. The system’s newness indicates its science-based structure and the accordance between its content and the contemporary level of science development and social practice. The LBC is a permanently developing system. The LBC has a broad range of options available – for scientific, public (termed 'mass' in the USSR before 1991), regional libraries as well as full, medium or abridged schedules – presented now both in books and in machine-readable (electronic) form. None of existing classification system could have survived that sort of severe social upheaval which had fallen to the lot of the LBC. Created in the USSR, it fully reflected the ideology of Soviet society. Only few years needed to accomplish the task of deideologization of its content entirely and to ensure the process of modernization, in fact, the updating of all the structure and contents. As a result, there came a schedules different from the Soviet LBC for its structure and content. In 2001, the commencing issue of the Medium LBC schedules appeared (the publishing is still proceeding: 6 of 9-10 issues have already been published). It is hard for libraries to have time to master each new issue of the schedules: the changes are so significant that it can even be necessary to start new ranges of catalogs, to restructure the book collections completely. The LBC is the National classification system of the Russian Federation. It adequately covers history, philosophy, economics, and geography of Russia, art and culture of its peoples, doing that as completely as no foreign classification could do. The LBC is now used in 95% of libraries in our country.",

The project has created a Semantic MediaWiki platform, which offers a collaborative environment. The semantic MediaWiki platform is an open collaborative website. This means that anyone can freely use it and also participate in the discussion about terms. The data available for all users includes the following details: The term and its synonyms in Finnish; Definition(s); The concept's place in the concept system and concept diagrams; Information about the term’s morphological structure; Ostensive definitions (e.g. pictures); Contexts (e.g. links to abstracts of articles); Term equivalents in other languages (and information about the translatability of terms when necessary).\n\nThe working method is a type of limited crowd-sourcing. The terminology will be gathered among expert groups in different fields of research. The project is being carried out in three pilot projects: botany, jurisprudence, and linguistics. In the course of the pilot projects, the operations models for the teamwork of expert groups will be developed in order to take into account varying practices and terminological demands in different subfields of research. The published view of each terminological entry will be defined by the relevant expert group and customized to fit the special needs of each field of research.\n\nThe core of the terminological work is done by expert teams from various fields of the arts and science. The members of each expert team have access to a wide range of wiki editing resources and can add information into every slot of the database in their field of expertise. They will also label the definition of a term as “checked” when they think that it meets the standards of the field. It is also possible to include existing terminologies in the bank – of course with the permission of those who own the copyright.",

Stage is an increasingly important component of cancer surveillance and cancer control and an endpoint for the evaluation of the population-based screening and early detection efforts. The UICC has published the UICC TNM classification of malignant tumours for over 50 years. The UICC TNM classification is the internationally accepted standard for cancer staging. The UICC TNM Classification is an anatomically based system that records the primary and regional nodal extent of the tumor and the absence or presence of metastases. (...) The UICC TNM staging system is the common language in which oncology health professionals can communicate on the cancer extent for individual patients as a basis for decision making on treatment management and individual prognosis but can also be used, to inform and evaluate treatment guidelines, national cancer planning and research. (...) The TNM classification is a unified standard and is a prerequisite for ensuring the quality of care in all resource-settings. It goes beyond clinician practice and constitutes vital information for policy-makers developing or implementing cancer control and prevention plans and it is therefore important to include the TNM classification as part of cancer registration.",

Each class has several synonyms, thereby finding the right product is much easier for everyone! (...) Uniform product classification in itself is not a final product as it is. The product classification is also not a software application, product database, product generator or search engine. Those are applications that use the article classification as a basis. The product classification offers the structure for standardised product data that you can exchange in a uniform way via the communication standards and which can be used in numerous applications. (...) With the gradual growth of acceptance of product classification, it is remarkable how trading companies hesitate to participate out of fear of price comparison. They are afraid that the transparency of product information makes it easier to compare product prices. This does contain a grain of truth. On the other hand, this is already possible with current technology and the product price is of course only one of the many selection criteria for a customer. Aspects such as quality, delivery reliability, logistical performance and supplier expertise also play an important role for a customer.

    "description": "DBK was the first bid for a coherent classification system for construction in Denmark and was developed in the period 2003-2006. DBK is a common system for classification of building and building information - developed for the Digital Building. DBK replaces the old SfB system And different industry-oriented or home-based systems. DBK is subsequently replaced by CCS. Classification is necessary to keep track of the many different types of information that is part of a construction project or in connection with building operations. The DBK classification system establishes a basic information structure, a coherent systematics And a common conceptual device that ensures precise communication. At the same time, it identifies any piece of information uniquely, making it easy to retrieve and recognize. It is a crucial prerequisite for digitizing the construction processes - and at the same time provides the basis for developing requirements specifications for development Off i T tools for construction. DBK establishes frameworks to classify all parts of the construction throughout its life cycle - from program to disposal. The system thus classifies not only building parts, buildings and rooms, but also actors, processes, documents, experience and building knowledge information, etc. DBK is also considerably more complex than, for example, SfB, as DBK considers a building component from different aspects or angles. For this reason, DBK operates with a product aspect (what the object consists of), a form aspect (how it looks), a functional aspect (how it is used) and a placement aspect (how it is built).",

In this scenario, issues with data quality and trustworthiness may strongly impact the data utility for end-users. The barriers involved in building an ETL infrastructure under the complexity and scale of the available Web-based data supply scenario, demands the deﬁnition of strategies which can provide data quality warranties and also minimize the effort associated with data management.\n\nIn this context, provenance, the representation of artifacts, processes and agents behind a piece of information, becomes a fundamental element of the data infrastructure. Provenance have a large spectrum of applications including documentation & reproducibility and data quality assessment & trustworthiness and consistency-checking & semantic reconciliation. However, in an environment where data is produced and consumed by different systems, the representation of provenance should be made interoperable across systems.\n\nStandardization eﬀorts towards the convergence into a common provenance model generated the Open Provenance Model (OPM). OPM provides a basic description of provenance which allows interoperability on the level of workﬂow structure. The deﬁnition of this common provenance ground allows systems with different provenance representations to share at least a workﬂow-level semantics (the causal dependencies between artifacts, processes and the intervention of agents). OPM, however, is not intended to be a complete provenance model, but demands the complementary use of additional provenance models in order to enable uses of provenance which requires higher level of semantic interoperability.\n\nCogs is an ETL Provenance Vocabulary which extends the workflow semantics provided by OPM and Prov-O, allowing the description of ETL processes and objects. The Cogs vocabulary can be used to describe data transformations in general, outside the scope of ETL tools and practices. The core objective of the vocabulary is to improve the level of semantic interoperability of data transformation provenance descriptors, building upon the OPM and Prov-O standardization efforts.",

    "description": "The 'Fachsystematik Bücher' of the University Library of Paderborn (UB) serves as a layout for the creation of the book inventory in the freehand areas of the UB. Since it is possible to search in the catalog for individual 'system sites' of the Fachsystematik, it offers one of several possibilities of the Factual research on the stock of printed books in the UB.\n\nThe subject system is based on the 'Gesamt-Hochschul-Bibliotheks-Systematik' (GHBS), which (...) was further developed by the libraries together with the Hochschulbibliothekszentrum in Köln (hbz). This cooperative further development was carried out on the basis of a majority decision of the o.g. Libraries in October 2004. In essence, this decision was based on the fact that the systematics of the individual libraries had evolved significantly over time, despite the commitment to the co-operative part of the care, and that a common approach to the revision required in some areas was not appropriate. Since autumn 2004, the UB Paderborn has continually been adapting its 'Fachsystematik Bücher' to the development of science in general and the teaching and research foci of the University of Paderborn in particular. It has, inter alia, Two fundamental aspects: on the one hand, in the case of adaptations, it is necessary to maintain the character of specialist systematics as a \"pragmatic universal regulation\" which takes into account all scientific disciplines. On the other hand, changes have to be critically examined under cost-benefit aspects in each individual case, as they are usually associated with very personnel-intensive workflows.\n\nIn total there are 35 individual systems. Each individual system has a number assigned to it in ascending line from 01 to 04, 07, etc. to 94, which also represents the layout scheme when the journals are drawn up. The compartment numbers or the notation from three to four uppercase letters of the individual system locations are part of the signature system of the UB. The subject system is an enumerative system. The notation range is from AAA to ZZZZ (three- or four-letter code). This framework has not been fully exploited so that there are limited and limited quotation quotas within and between individual systems.\n\nIf the individual systems are compared with one another, subject systems such as 'other philologies' and 'other fields of technology' are excluded, since they do not concern a single subject by name. Rather, they are a summary of several disciplines. The subject system 'Authors' Humanities' also stands out from the other individual subject systems; It is not primarily organized according to factual criteria, but first of all arranged in a very coherent chronology (antiquity, medieval and modern times), and on the second level of organization alphabetically according to the names of authors from the field of humanities.\n\nIn addition to the system locations, the subject system also contains references (as 'See-Referral' or 'See-Referral'); It can be referred to points within the same subject system as well as to other individual systematics. In the case of the latter, the abbreviated name of this subject system is also indicated for quick orientation. The abbreviated name usually consists of the three initial letters of the subject systematics and can be seen from the table of contents.",

Its old AT number (211*) has disappeared.\n\nAnother side to the revision is that the overall content of various types of tales has been changed, in both small ways and more comprehensively. And such changes mean that old 'AT umbrellas' (numbers) for the types of tales, do not serve as well as before as classification devices in every case, for example in many Norwegian folktales I have checked and commented on in Norwegian.

Four-times daily observations of temperature, dew point, wind, pressure, and cloud cover are incorporated into the model.

Hence, the SSC is most properly called a weather type classification and not an air mass classification system.\n\n Within the SSC scheme, weather-type characteristics change from station to station and day to day. Thus, a Moist Tropical weather type is hotter and more humid in the southeastern US, nearer its source region, than in the northeastern US, after it has modified somewhat. Similarly, MT is warmer at all locations in July than in January. (...)\n\n On this website, SSC 'calendars' are available for nearly 400 stations across the US, Canada, and parts of Europe. The European calendars are limited to 1974-2000, but the US and Canadian calendars generally cover a station's total period of record. A total of over 8,000,000 days have been classified across all of these stations. The SSC is also being continually updated - you can see yesterday's (preliminary) classifications and today's and tomorrow's forecast classifications as well.

This Dictionary was started in 2004 under Jeanne Dancette’s direction, professor at the Department of Linguistics and Translation, Université de Montréal. The aim is to provide better understanding of the concepts of globalization, economics and labour. This is why a typical entry contains a definition, a context and a descriptive summary of the concept referred to, as well as a list of associated terms. Thus, you can read them as mini encyclopaedic articles giving basic information about past and present realities. The definitions offered are general and consensual. The information presented results from our own synthesis of authorized texts written by experts in the field. The articles are written in English, French and Spanish. However, they are not translations; they differ according to the information found in each language, sometimes complementing each other. The DAMT is also a thesaurus. Its aim is to provide terminology in three different languages. The Dictionary features a system of semantic relations between terms—an innovative approach conceived to help unveil the nuances between concepts.

It is primarily used by mountaineers in the United States and Canada. The Class 5 portion of the Class scale is primarily a rock climbing classification system, while the Classes 1-3 are used mainly in hiking and trail running. Originally the system was a single-part classification system. In recent years, Grade and Protection categories were added to the system. The new categories do not apply to every climb and usage varies widely. The grades are subjective, reflecting the first ascenscionist's opinion of the climb's difficulty. There are also systematic regional differences in grading within the United States.",

With the exception of MRC (which has signed up to a UK-wide classification system for health research, the Health Research Classification System, HRCS, the hierarchical structure of which MRC considers cannot be accommodated within the RCUK structure) the Research Councils will initially seek to harmonise the classifications across the Councils. Two Classification workshops were organised, as a result of which the RCs have delivered to UK SBS enough defined structure and content to create the required three-level research classification and reviewer matching structure. The information which will be used to populate the top two levels of the structure are 90% accurate as agreed (apart from possible typos and stylistic considerations). There are, however, some duplications (some of which are intentional and some unintentional) that should ideally be reviewed. The third level of the hierarchy (Keys), required by EPSRC and BBSRC for reviewer matching are 90% compliant with the requirements of UK SBS. Unfortunately, the third level hierarchy (Keys) will not provide a reviewer matching functionality for EPSRC that is fit for purpose without further review. While the structure of the hierarchy is very unlikely to change over time, agreed changes will, inevitably, need to be made to data fields in the future and in the short term to Keys, to make them fit for purpose for reviewer matching. Attention will now be given to how this will be handled, given that PRGPG is not a standing group.",

This will result in functional knowledge networks of taxonomic experts and regional focal points, which will collaborate on the establishment of standardised and authoritative taxonomic (meta-) data.\n\nPESI will coordinate the integration and synchronisation of the European taxonomic information systems into a joint e-infrastructure and the set up of a common user-interface disseminating the pan-European checklists and associated user-services results.\n\nThe organisation of national and regional focal point networks as projected not only assures the efficient access to local expertise, but is also important for the synergistic promotion of taxonomic standards throughout Europe, for instance to liaison with national governmental bodies on the implementation of European biodiversity legislations.\n\nPESI will provide a robust infrastructure to support the nomenclatural needs of European users and stakeholders. PESI will specifically address the issues of: pooling resources, standardisation, sustainability, accessibility and international cooperation.",

This has the advantage that the term of the term is consistent, that is, users are not confronted with different terms for the same understanding. By networking, libraries can consult each other's catalogs and exchange bibliographic data. Central cataloging, such as the Common Automated Cataloging System (GGC) of OCLC plays an important role in this. Libraries with a regional support function, for example, make use of terms from the NBD | Biblion Trefwoordenthesaurus for the subject termination of their title descriptions in the GGC. They regularly make proposals for n Old terms. NBD | Biblion takes care of the tuning and management of the thesaurus as the central public library catalog of public libraries. The thesaurus terminals may also be available for inclusion in (part) thesauri that can be used for the subject termination in specific (bibliographic) products.\n\nThis is possible by applying so-called type indicators that indicate which file or product will be assigned the termination terms.",

The standard complements existing wetland and upland classification systems.\n\nThe six components of the classification standard represent the different aspects of the seascape (water column, geoform, substrate, biotic communities, biogeographic setting, and aquatic setting), starting with the broadest systems (marine, estuarine, and lacustrine) and narrowing to the most detailed physical and biological elements associated with a specific habitat type (biotic community).\n\nCMECS is periodically updated to reflect the best science and the needs of the coastal management communities.

Originally, the scheme used capital letters running alphabetically, but was later reordered to reflect the surface temperatures of stars. In order of decreasing temperature, these types were O, B, A, F, G, K and M. Three additional categories also in the scheme: R, N, and S types, were later realized to represent stars with peculiar heavy-metal abundances. Other types (Q for novae, W for Wolf-Rayet stars, etc) are not encountered frequently. According to astronomical myth, Henry Norris Russell suggested the following mnemonic to assist students in remembering the scheme: Oh Be A Fine Girl, Kiss Me!",

At its launch CRRO provides access to six online collections containing over 20,000 specimens of Republican coinage.\n\nThe description of coin types provided here is based on Michael Crawford's 1974 publication Roman Republican Coinage (RRC), which is still the primary typology used for the identification of Roman Republican coin types. Since its publication in 1974 there have been significant revisions to the dating of the series following the discovery of new hoards, but no attempt has been made to reflect these or make any other amendments to the published typology at this stage. The descriptions for these coins are based on the typology set out in RRC, but have been modified to meet the standards of the British Museum’s collection management system by Eleanor Ghey and Ian Leins. These were previously published in Ghey and Leins 2010, which forms an update to the 1910 catalogue of the collection by Grueber. Additional types not in the British Museum’s collection were added to this database by Richard Witschonke of the ANS.",

    "description": "The Public Service Thesaurus (PST) has been developed as a list of descriptors, or controlled vocabulary, by which public sector resources may be indexed. It was developed to facilitate public sector compliance with the Irish Public Service Metadata Standard (IPSMS), and in so doing to enhance the capacity of public sector organisaitons to make their resources accessible and visible to their client base.\n\nCompliance can be achieved by using appropriate terms from the vocabulary in conjunction with the mandatory DC.Subject element.\n\nThe structure of the PST is such as to ensure ease of navigation around the vocabulary. It is represented at the top level by fourteen separate categories based on the wide areas of interest and involvement of public sector organisations. These top-level cateogries subdivide into second-level categories and so forth, each level in turn listing more specific subject sub-divisions.\n\nMany terms in the PST have been posted upwards in order to 1) limit the number of terms available for indexing, and consequently keep the thesaurus to a manageable size, and 2) to ensure as far as is practicable that resources sharing a common theme are returned together. This implies that the degree of specificity of terms available as indexing terms has been restricted. The PST, as an information retrieval thesaurus, is largely concerned with grouping like subject matter together, rather than allowing the naming of a particular object to the exclusion of others. In summary, a (preferred) term should be general enough that it might be used to index a number of items.",

It draws upon the paradigms of IBIS(Issue Based Information System), argumentation and design rationale. It is linked to W3C PROV by defining the actors in the design process as PROV agents and the design artifacts themselves are PROV entities. However DIO uses a modualrised version of PROV-O, based on Syntactic locality. DIO makes few assumptions about the design process used as the definitions of these activities properly belongs in the software lifecycle and data lifecycle models. The Figure below illustrates the conceptual entities in DIO and their relationships.",

The development of a semantic Ontology for Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) and International Environmental Law was identified as a priority for MEA Secretariats and UNEP at the first meeting of the MEA Information and Knowledge Management (IKM) Initiative. Members to the MEA IKM Initiative agreed on the need for a ‘controlled vocabulary’ to allow for easier searching, locating and retrieving of MEA information such as decisions by MEA governing bodies and meeting documents, reports and national plans.\n\nGenerous financial support from the European Union provided for the review and enhancement of the draft InforMEA glossary through a Multi-Stakeholder process. The MEA IKM Initiative identified the IUCN Environmental Law Centre as collaborator in the development of the next version of the vocabulary and chose the FAO’s VOCbench system as the platform for the development and maintenance of the vocabulary. The IKM Initiative also reached out to organizations involved in the development of thesauri, such as the European Environment Agency’s GEMET, the ECOLEX and the FAOlex glossary.",

    "description": "This hierarchic Vocabulary relies on the definitions of the Simplified Petrography in Salzburg. Another classification can be found in CIL Material Glossar. No Definitions can therefore be found here.\n\nMost of the Alternative Terms in Bulgarian, Turkish, Croatian, Suomi, Arabic and Modern Greek come from the EpiDoc Consortium efforts.\n\nThe vocabulary is hierarchically designed to allow for both precise and generic definition, as well as for several types of uncertainty. In many cases, for example for precious/exotic materials (onyx, gold, etc.) precision is possible and desirable but for most banal materials only basic distinctions will generally be possible. In many cases scholars in epigraphy do not seek to decided whether a base was of Proconnesian or Thasian marble, nor to decide exactly what kind of stone the local material was (generally a form of limestone), in such cases, according to us, we shall be able to be as precise as possible, but the best practice is to allow for different levels of depth of the information which might be meaningful only in some cases.\n\nA result of this approach has also been that this vocabulary should also be a fairly complete list of possible material on which an inscription from antiquity can be found.\n\nMany problems are involved with this kind of classification as well. 'Arcilla' for example is not in the same 'class' as 'terracotta, inscribed brick, etc', because it pertains to the material in which the inscription was written or carved in, that is, like 'stone, metal or wood'. There are also specific terms which could be assimilated but are not, like 'Lumaquela', the local name for the stone in which most of the inscriptions from Tarraco were carved in.",

    "description": "Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) has long included headings that represent the genre or form of musical works in combination with the mediums of performance (e.g., Sonatas (Trombone and organ); Concertos (Bassoon, clarinet, English horn, flute)), as well as headings that represent the mediums of performance alone (e.g., Bass clarinet and piano music). The structure of the headings can sometimes be of marginal utility to researchers, who may be most interested in finding music for a particular combination of instruments and are less focused on the genre of the music.\n\nOver the coming year, the concepts in the existing LC subject headings will be broken into their component parts. The forms and genres of musical works will be included in Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms for Library and Archival Materials (LCGFT) in 2014 or early 2015. The mediums of performance will be contained in the Library of Congress Medium of Performance Thesaurus for Music (LCMPT). When LCMPT and LCGFT terms for music are both implemented, the LC subject headings will cease to be assigned in new cataloging and will eventually be cancelled.\n\nLCMPT is a stand-alone vocabulary that provides terminology to describe the instruments, voices, etc., used in the performance of musical works. (...) The initial 802 LCMPT terms are based chiefly on existing LC subject headings, but some additional terms that do not already appear in LCSH have also been included. Authorized terms and references in LCMPT generally consist of single words and phrases, but parenthetical qualifiers are occasionally employed to differentiate among homonyms. All terms and references are in the singular form and are lowercased unless they are proper nouns (e.g., flute; saxophone ensemble; but Irish harp)\n\nThe thesaurus has three broadest terms: ensemble, instrument, and performer. Each of the other terms is hierarchically subordinate to one or more of these terms and exhibits the class/class member relationship. Most of the authorized terms have Used For (UF) references for synonyms. Scope notes are also provided in many cases, and may describe the medium’s physical structure, the time period in which it was popular, and/or its geographic origin.",

    "description": "This vocabulary will be used to describe the creators of, and contributors to, resources, and also the intended audience of resources. It will be created and maintained by the Policy and Standards Division, and be distinct from the other vocabularies that are maintained by that division: Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH), Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms for Library and Archival Materials (LCGFT), and the Library of Congress Medium of Performance Thesaurus for Music (LCMPT). (...) The development of LCDGT is necessitated by two circumstances: the genre/form project and the growing popularity of faceted displays and searching.\n\nThe genre/form project formed the original impetus for creating a demographic terms vocabulary. Some LC subject headings—most notably the form headings for literature—include demographic information (e.g., Children’s stories, American, in which stories is the form, children are the audience demographic, and American, the creator demographic). The use of LCSH form headings for works of literature will be phased out as LC genre/form terms for literature are implemented, necessitating another method for bringing out the audience and creator/contributor information. (LCSH form headings will still be assigned to works about literature.\n\nNew discovery interfaces also make a new vocabulary desirable. Subject headings such as Children’s stories, American are assigned to works about American children’s stories, and also to works that are American children’s stories, so the computer cannot distinguish between the two types of works. LCGFT began to ameliorate this situation by allowing for a genre/form search, separate from a subject search. Users often want to know, though, what works a library has by a particular group (e.g., novels by lawyers), or for a particular group (e.g., handbooks for nurses). The demographic term vocabulary will fill the latter need. Together, LCSH, LCGFT, LCMPT, and LCDGT will allow for much more precision and flexibility in searching because terms within and across vocabularies can be mixed and matched to attain the level of specificity required.",

Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations. The resulting network of meaningfully related words and concepts can be navigated with the browser. WordNet is also freely and publicly available for download. WordNet's structure makes it a useful tool for computational linguistics and natural language processing.\n\n WordNet superficially resembles a thesaurus, in that it groups words together based on their meanings. However, there are some important distinctions. First, WordNet interlinks not just word forms—strings of letters—but specific senses of words. As a result, words that are found in close proximity to one another in the network are semantically disambiguated. Second, WordNet labels the semantic relations among words, whereas the groupings of words in a thesaurus does not follow any explicit pattern other than meaning similarity.",

The ~100 new classes were chosen for their use in categorizing the major vertebrate and invertebrate anatomy ontologies at a granularity adequate for tissues of a single cell type.\n\nThe AEO is intended to be useful in increasing the amount of knowledge in anatomy ontologies, facilitating annotation and enabling interoperability across anatomy ontologies.\n\nAn important subcategory of the AEO is simple tissue (a synonym of the CARO portion of tissue), a recognisable anatomical entity composed predominantly to a single cell type. CARO had a only few epithelial classes here and these are inadequate for capturing the richness of anatomical tissue knowledge. The AEO has ~70 simple tissues and these are linked to their cell types (~100) as detailed in the cell type ontology through a has_part relationship. The AEO thus includes a subset of the cell type ontology.\n\nThe AEO has been refined through its use in annotating the ~2500 terms of the new version of the Ontology of Developing Human Anatomy and, while this has improved the ontology, it may have given it a mammalian bias.\n\nThe ontology can be used to classify most organisms as its terms are appropriate for most plant and fungal tissues.

    "description": "Over the last three years of our work with the Incluseum, we’ve thought, written, and talked extensively of the power of words. (...) Working through the medium of the blog, however, we became dissatisfied with our ad-hoc and fractured way of organizing content. In other words, related content has not been systematically categorized and labelled as to make their relations visible. Moreover, we were concerned that our simple buckets (e.g., 'race/racism', 'gender', etc.) did not accurately capture how we wanted to be referring to the content in our blogposts. To address this situation, we partnered with Gabbie Barnes and Becca Fronczak, both students in the University of Washington’s Master in Library and Information Science program. They used their skills to develop a metadata schema for The Incluseum blog. A metadata schema helps create a standard for how things (i.e., information resources) should be described within a particular context to enhance user access. Here, their goal was also to ensure that the metadata schema would match The Incluseum’s values.",

These stories often share similar themes, characters, items, and locations: by providing an approach to linking these items together, stories can become powerfully navigable, discoverable, and open to new analysis and creation techniques. The Stories ontology was developed in collaboration with the BBC, with an aim to creating an ontology for narrative representation that could be applied across a diverse set of cases. These included accounts of events in Northern Ireland, the storylines of Doctor Who episodes, and key events of the Battle of Britain.\n\nThe Stories Ontology is built upon the oft-used Event and Timeline ontologies, thus ensuring interoperability with many existing datasets and allowing for the use of extension ontologies when needed.",

    "description": "Vagueness is a common human knowledge and language phenomenon, typically manifested by terms and concepts like High, Expert, Bad, Near, etc. It is a phenomenon related to our inability to precisely determine the extensions of such concepts in certain domains and contexts. That is because vague concepts have typically blurred boundaries which do not allow for a sharp distinction between the entities that fall within their extension and those that do no. For example, some people are borderline tall: not clearly 'tall' and not clearly 'not tall'.\n\nIn an OWL ontology vagueness may primarily appear in the definitions of classes, object and datatype properties, and datatypes. A class is vague if, in the given domain, context or application scenario, it admits borderline cases, namely if there are (or could be) individuals for which it is indeterminate whether they instantiate the class. Typical vague classes are attributions, namely classes that reflect qualitative states of entities (e.g., TallPerson, ExperiencedResearcher etc.). Similarly, an object property (relation) is vague if there are (or could be) pairs of individuals for which it is indeterminate whether they stand in the relation (e.g., hasGenre, hasIdeology etc.). The same applies for datatype properties and pairs of individuals and literal values. Finally, a vague datatype consists of a set of vague terms. An example is the datatype RestaurantPriceRange when this comprises the terms 'cheap', 'moderate' and 'expensive'.\n\nThe Vagueness Ontology enables the explicit identification and description of vague entities and (some of) their vagueness-related characteristics in OWL ontologies. Such a description is to be made by ontology creators and its goal is the narrowing of the possible interpretations that its vague entities may assume by human and software agents.",

Workflows serve a dual function: first, as detailed documentation of the scientific method used for an experiment (i. e. the input sources and processing steps taken for the derivation of a certain data item), and second, as re-usable, executable artifacts for data-intensive analysis. Scientific workflows are composed of a variety of data manipulation activities such as Data Movement, data transformation, Data Analysis and Data Visualization to serve the goals of the scientific study. The composition is done through the constructs made available by the workflow system used, and is largely shaped by the function undertaken by the workflow and the environment in which the system operates. (...) This document specifies the classes and properties of the Workflow Motifs ontology, the OWL 2 encoding ot the aforementioned motif catalogue.

LOD is used to create Web artifacts that machines can interpret, so publishing machine-readable statistical classifications and other concept management systems as SKOS instances is desired. The XKOS developers found that SKOS was insufficient for the problem. No aspect of SKOS was found to be wrong, just incomplete. Therefore, an extension to SKOS, called XKOS, is proposed.\n\nXKOS extends SKOS for the needs of statistical classifications. It does so in two main directions. First, it defines a number of terms that enable the representation of statistical classifications with their structure and textual properties, as well as the relations between classifications. Second, it refines SKOS semantic properties to allow the use of more specific relations between concepts. Those specific relations can be used for the representation of classifications or for any other case where SKOS is employed. XKOS adds the extensions that are desirable to meet the requirements of the statistical community.",

    "description": "Since the mid-1960s, an attempt has been made to simplify the legal drafting language in the common law countries. Particular emphasis was placed on the need to use simple language without redundancies and legalese so that legal texts are clear and understandable even by those who do not have legal training but do not lack legal integrity And validity.\n\nThe above effort has been systematically organized, among other things, through the creation of various organizations in the UK, such as the Plain English Campaign, Clarity and Plain Language Commission, which aimed to promote the change of the traditional legal writing style by introducing the use of simple English Languages.\n\nToday, the use of simple English in drafting legal texts has been adopted at the state level not only in the UK and the United States, but also in other countries of Anglo-American law, such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada. However, traditional English legal terminology is still widely used. The main reason for this approach is linked to the belief that the interpretation of these established legal expressions can not be challenged by the courts.\n\nRegardless of whether the author of a legal text chooses traditional or plain English, the translation of legal texts into English requires knowledge of the substantive differences between the civil law and the common law in order to achieve accurate performance Of legal terms and concepts, and in any case a specific expressive style should be chosen to ensure uniformity and consistency in the outcome. Finally, the choice of linguistic type between British English and American English is not only aesthetic, but it also implies knowledge of the differences in terminology between these two types of English.",

    "description": "The beginning of the subject-classification system - books arranged by subject according to a classification schedule - is dated, rather too precisely, as 1890, because in that year the second library building (Chittenden Hall) was opened. The first library building, originally containing about 20,000 volumes, had reached its capacity of some 200,000 volumes in less than fifty years. The necessity of expanding into a second building made the year 1890 a natural time for making a radical change, which had undoubtedly been contemplated for several years. Although it may be obvious that all 200,000 books were not reclassified at once, it is difficult to realize that twenty-five years elapsed before the bulk of the books had been dealt with, and even today there are a few of the numbered-shelves books which still await reclassification. It is this very length of time occupied in the transition that accounts for much of the indigenous heterogeneity of the Yale Library's classification system.  One element that caused delay was the choice of classification schedules. Although many more libraries were using subject classification schemes in 1890 than in 1701, especially in America, the Library of Congress schedules had not yet been published. Dewey's Decimal Classification had reached its third edition, but its rigidly topical structure had no great appeal for members of the Yale faculty, who preferred either a geographical or chronological approach to their material. Other available schemes were also rejected, and Addison Van Name, then Librarian, began work on a new system for Yale, based to a large extent on the classification recently devised by Hartwig for the University of Halle.",

It is published primarily for the use of the Yale Law Library staff now and in the future. In its preparation no thought was given to the question whether or not it might be adopted by other libraries. (...) The basis of procedure was that the classification should serve the Library, rather than that the Library should be bound by a preconceived theoretical classification. Although it does in fact in most instances facilitate access to the shelves by readers working as lawyers are accustomed to work, it does not purport to bring all material on a given subject together. This seemed to be neither possible nor desirable, and therefore emphasis has from the outset been laid on the subject side of the card catalogue to which one must, in any library, refer in order to find all material in the library on a given subject.",

Borden, who served as librarian between 1897- and 1903-1910. After the establishment of the New Haven Free Public Library in 1887, the Institute Library began to withdraw from the public life of the city and focus primarily on expanding and circulating its collection of general-interest and popular literature. The librarian during this period, William A. Borden, made use of the Institute Library as a laboratory in which to experiment with new library technologies and practices. During the first six months of his engagement, he developed a new classification system for the library’s collection, which is unique to the Institute Library and remains in use today, together with Borden’s original card catalog. In 1910, Borden accepted an invitation from the progressive Indian prince, Maharaja Savajirao Gaekwad III of Baroda, to create and direct a free public library system for the people of his state.",

    "description": "Welcome to Online Taxonomic Keys, a joint project of Fisheries and Oceans Canada and the Royal BC Museum. This project seeks to facilitate the development of, and make readily available, a variety of regional and global identification keys in a format that is concise and easy to use. The information presented is compiled from published and unpublished works from taxonomic specialists worldwide.\n\nTaxonomic keys are important tools used by scientists and other investigators to identify specific organisms based on defining characteristics. Up until the last decade, these keys were most often published as dichotomous keys, in which specimens are identified by choosing from a progressive series of pairs of options until a solution is reached. While dichotomous keys are still universally used, the online arena provides the opportunity to design and use keys based on a character matrix.\n\nThe identification keys on this site are based on a character matrix format. Specimens may be identified by selecting one or more character states (columns) for each character (rows). As selections are made a list of possible species identifications will appear at the bottom of the matrix. Clicking on the species name opens an information sheet with more information to help you understand the specimen you’ve identified.\n\nThis library of identification keys is a work in progress, and will grow and expand as new keys become available.",

    "description": "A puzzle should be classified by the problem that its designer intended the solver to encounter whilst attempting to solve it.  In the case of a 3D interlocking assembly in the form of a cage with a ball in the centre: the fact that the instructions request the would-be solver to 'remove the ball' does not change the 3D assembly into an opening puzzle. The disassembly and/or reassembly of the cage remains the primary function of the puzzle. An interlocking puzzle should be classified according to its interior construction, rather than its outward appearance (e.g. a wooden cube, sphere, barrel, or teddy bear may all have similar Cartesian internal construction and so should all be classed as Interlocking-Cartesian). In cases where it seems possible to place a puzzle in more than one category, it must be classified in whichever is the most significant category.  A few puzzles may have to be cross-referenced if it is absolutely necessary; however in most puzzles, which include two different classes of problem, one class will usually be dominant by virtue of the fact that in solving it, the secondary problem has also been solved.\n\nA good example of multiple-class puzzles is the 'Mazy Ball Game' made in Taiwan in the 1990s - It is based on a 3x3 sliding block puzzle under a clear plastic top - The pieces have L-shaped groves and a ball must be rolled up a ramp in the lower right onto one of the blocks - the ball must be moved from block to block and the blocks themselves slid around so that the ball can exit at the top left. Thus the puzzle requires Dexterity, Sequential movement and Routefinding.  It would be classed as Routefinding because, if the route has been found, then the dexterity and sequence must have also been achieved.\n\nA puzzle will be referred to as 2D if its third dimension is irrelevant (e.g. thickness of paper or plywood or an operation involving a third dimension such as folding). Most standard jigsaws are 2D; however jigsaws with sloping cuts in fact have a relevant third dimension, so they must be classed as 3D.\n\nIt will be noted that the definition of 'A Puzzle' excludes the infants 'posting box' which whilst perhaps puzzling the infant was contrived only to educate and amuse; it also excludes the archer attempting to get a bulls‑eye, the exercise of whose ingenuity is entirely incidental to the original warlike intent of the sport. Also excluded are puzzles that only require paper and pencil (e.g. crossword puzzles), unless they are on or part of some physical object.  It is understood that specialist collectors will further subdivide the Sub‑Classes to suit their own specialised needs. For example, Tanglement Rigid & Tanglement Semi-Rigid is awaiting a thorough study of the topology of wire puzzles.\n\nThe full abbreviations consist of 3 characters, hyphen, plus up to 4 characters, such as 'INT‑CART'. These are the standard abbreviations for the classes that have been chosen for relative ease of memory and conformity with most computer databases.",

A sub-fallacy, which is a specific version of a more general fallacy, has whatever features the more general fallacy has, together with specific features which set it apart and make it worth naming in its own right. For example, instead of grouping together 'fallacies of relevance', there is one most general such fallacy—namely, Red Herring—and all fallacies of relevance are sub-fallacies of it. Red Herring is itself a sub-fallacy of Informal Fallacy, which is a sub-fallacy of the most general logical fallacy of all: Logical Fallacy. Logical Fallacy is, thus, the top node of the Taxonomy, for every fallacy in the Taxonomy is a sub-fallacy of it. The sub-fallacy relationship is like a tree with a trunk―Logical Fallacy―which branches until it reaches leaves, that is, fallacies which have no sub-fallacies―for example, Appeal to Celebrity.",

    "description": "The first EPOC taxonomy of health systems interventions was developed in 2002, and included the following categories: (1) professional interventions; (2) financial interventions; (3) organisational interventions; and (4) regulatory interventions. This taxonomy was extensively revised and updated between 2013 and 2015 to address key gaps and also to bring the EPOC taxonomy into alignment with other taxonomies that were being used to classify health systems interventions in widely used online databases (Lavis 2015). Our starting point was a taxonomy for health systems arrangements developed for the Health Systems Evidence database (http://www.healthsystemsevidence.org) (Lavis 2015). We applied this taxonomy to all of the interventions included in four overviews of systematic reviews of health systems interventions of high relevance to low income countries (Ciapponi 2014; Herrera 2014; Pantoja 2014; Wiysonge 2014). The taxonomy was then revised iteratively to ensure that all of the included reviews were appropriately categorized and that all relevant health system arrangements and implementation strategies were included and organized logically.\n\nWe then applied the revised taxonomy to all of the interventions covered by EPOC reviews. Further minor revisions were made to the taxonomy at this stage to ensure appropriate categorisation of interventions and we also refined the definitions of each of the categories and subcategories.",

The resulting COPE Case Taxonomy comprises 18 main classification categories and 100 keywords and is designed to be descriptive not judgemental.\n\nAll the cases in COPE’s database were recoded and all new cases are being coded according to the new taxonomy (up to two classifications, denoting the main topics discussed, and 10 keywords can be assigned per case). It is important to note that classification and keyword coding denotes that a topic was raised and discussed, not that a particular form of publication misconduct had occurred.\n\nThe COPE Case Taxonomy is available, with appropriate attribution, for use by other organizations and individuals.

    "description": "As members of the Finding Things team have written previously, we’ve long understood the need for a GOV.UK taxonomy that’s subject-based and site-wide, and we’ve been working towards achieving this challenging aim for a while. When finished, the taxonomy will group together all content on the site in a meaningful and intuitive way, using a hierarchical structure. It will consist of many ‘topics’ and ‘subtopics’, to which all content items will be tagged. We’re not there yet, but we do now have a branch that covers the government’s education offering - and with all the relevant content tagged to it, thanks to the tireless work of publishers within the government’s education organisations. (...)\n\nSo why does government need a site-wide taxonomy? Because government has a lot of content: more than 300,000 individual items, in fact. With so much content it can be very difficult for users to find the thing they’re looking for - or, if they’re searching more broadly around a subject, to find things of real value or relevance. We also know from user research with professional users like teachers, accountants, lawyers and tax specialists that there are people who need to see everything about a topic so they can do their job properly. Without a subject-based taxonomy in place, these users might only get partial information and not the full picture. This new taxonomy will act as a framework for a redesigned navigation, with the 2 working in tandem to help users orientate themselves and explore the site more confidently and effectively.",

    "description": "Objectives of the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) are to advance the classification of psychopathology to maximize its usefulness for research and clinical practice. The HiTOP aims to address limitations of traditional nosologies, such as the DSM-5 and ICD-10, including arbitrary boundaries between psychopathology and normality, often unclear boundaries between disorders, frequent disorder co-occurrence, heterogeneity within disorders, and diagnostic instability.\n\nThe HiTOP approaches these problems by conducting an empirical search for psychopathology structures starting from the most basic building blocks and proceeding to the highest level of generality: combining individual signs and symptoms into homogeneous components or traits, assembling them into empirically-derived syndromes, and finally grouping them into psychopathology spectra (e.g., internalizing and externalizing).\n\nThis approach reduces within-disorder heterogeneity by grouping related symptoms together and assigning unrelated symptoms to different components. It makes comorbidity an explicit and predictable feature of the model by classifying related syndromes together. Finally, it describes psychiatric phenomenaally, addressing boundary problems and diagnostic instability. The HiTOP is not limited to dimensions, if evidence indicates existence of a natural boundary, this qualitative distinction will be incorporated in the model also.\n\nThe HiTOP system aims to significantly advance mental health research and care, providing an effective way to convey information on risk factors, etiology, pathophysiology, phenomenology, illness course, and treatment response, thus greatly improving the utility of the diagnosis of mental disorders. Dimensional measures have been developed to assess many aspects of the system, and several domains of the HiTOP are ready for clinical and research applications.",

To complicate matters, the range of projects and applications that the term IoT covers is vast. IoT applications could be made up of a simple sensor that reports whether a door is open or not (in the case of a simple security system) or whether a button has been pressed (in the case of a remote doorbell) to very sophisticated solutions that monitor dozens of phenomena, make complex calculations based on those phenomena, and then prompt a response (in the case of autonomous drones, for example). A means of classifying different IoT projects will be useful to properly understand the current state of IoT adoption, compare different IoT initiatives, and to inform decision making when it comes to policy development, and the definition research and market development initiatives.To this end, Digital Catapult has started to define a taxonomy that will provide an effective way of classifying IoT initiatives.",

Instead, it was modeled around the 'subject reading rooms' into which the collection had been divided. The intent was to utilise the expertise of the departments, and their teaching needs in drawing up the divisions within the scheme.",

In particular, these indicate stages in the publishing workflow. For example, a siginificant state change for an online article publication occurs when it is bound to an issue publication, whereby it transitions from an earlier 'Advance online publication' state to an 'Issue publication' state. These state changes are managed by publish-event objects which capture both the publish-state and the date (or datetime) at which this event occurs.",

For example, a published article may subsequently be corrected via an erratum published as an article in its own right. This erratum can declare a relationship with the article it is amending by using a relations:isErratumOf relationship between itself and the article. It is then possible to add the inverse property relations:hasErratum on the original article to point to the erratum which has amended it in some way. The Relations Ontology lists many such pairs of relationships. All of these relationships are subproperties of the Core Ontology property :relation.",

CAT was the important fruits of more than 100 professionals’ six years hard work. The international and national standards were adopted while designing and constructing CAT. CAT covers areas including agriculture, forestry, biology, etc. It is organized in 40 main categories and contains more than 63 thousands concepts and most of them have English translation. In addition, CAT includes more than 130 thousands semantic relationships such as Use, UF, BT, NT and RT.\n\nCAT is now available as a Linked Data set published. The Linked Data version of CAT is in RDF/SKOS-XL, and is stored in Virtuoso triple store. Data is accessible to machines through a SPARQL endopoint, and to humans by means of a HTML pages generated with Virtuoso. From 2005, AII cooperated with FAO, started the CAT to AGROVOC mapping work, conforming to the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) mapping rules (skos: exactMatch, broadMatch and narrowMatch were mainly considered and applied). In addition, CAT has also been mapped to EUROVOC, NALT, LCSH automatically just based on the label string exact match. These mapping results could lay fundamental bases for higher level interoperability (e.g. cross-lingual information retrieval and knowledge discovery applications).",

The Shape attribute describes, a) the development of crystal faces bounding particles in crystalline compond materials, and b) surface rounding of grains in sedimentary rocks. Roundness is a measure of the sharpness of the edges between surfaces bounding a particle (see Jackson, 1997; Wadell, 1932) and is an indication of the degree of abrasion of a clastic particle. Expressed by Wadell (1932) as the ratio of the average radius of curvature of the several edges or corners of the particle to the radius of curvature of the maximum inscribed sphere (or to one-half the nominal diameter of the particle). The value is more conveniently computed from a plane figure (a projection or cross section); thus, roundness may be defined as the ratio of the average radius of curvature of the corners of the particle image to the radius of the maximum inscribed circle. A perfectly rounded particle (such as a sphere) has a roundness value of 1.0; less-rounded particles have values less than 1.0. The corresponding concept in aggregates with crystalline as opposed to clastic grains is here referred to as crystallinity, and is the degree to which a mineral grain is bounded by crystal faces. Terms should be appropriate for the kind of compound material (eg: for crystalline rocks- euhedral, ideoblastic, subhedral, anhedral, xenoblastic; for sedimentary rocks - angular, rounded). By extension, this vocabulary includes all concepts in this conceptScheme, as well as concepts in any previous versions of the scheme.",

A quantitative specification is based on the ratio of lengths of long, intermediate and short axes of grain shape (Sneed and Folk, 1958; Zingg, 1935). This vocabulary includes terms for specifying average shape of some collection of particles.(eg: prolate, slightly flattened, very bladed, equant, acicular, tabular). Numeric shape values from Sneed and Folk (1958) are best understood by looking at the pictures of particles with the different shapes there and in Pettijohn et al. (1972).

Moreover, it referred to existing thesauri, primarily the GEMET thesaurus, the AGROVOC thesaurus, and the STW Thesaurus for Economics. In the second version, terms rendering the dynamic or temporal aspects of the domain were added. Version 3 was supplemented with terms from the OGC Land and Infrastructure Conceptual Model Standard (LandInfra), and version 4 added code lists names and values from both standards. Version 5 started a multi-lingual itinerary by adding terms (SKOS: prefLabel) in Danish and Turkish, the native language of the authors.

    "description": "The type attribute of the LIDO Resource Representation element qualifies the digital representation of a resource offered by the data provider for online presentation.\n\nIt is intended to support online services with respect to the reuse of digital resources that are referenced in the LIDO record. The controlled type vocabulary allows data providers to indicate which variant of a digital resource is described in an instance of the LIDO Resource Representation element. The vocabulary shall support common reuse scenarios such as presenting the digital resource in a search result list, in a detail view, or as downloadable media file. It may also be exploited for retrieval functions such as filtering search results by digital media types.\n\nThe top-level terms are defined to distinguish between the best available variant of a digital resource the data provider can offer for online presentation (provided_representation), the variant a data provider has selected for preview purposes (preview_representation), and the image possibly provided as replacement for the digital resource (placeholder). The definitions of the subordinate terms additionally cover the digital media type. It is highly recommended to use one of the more specific terms, provided_3D, provided_audio, provided_image, provided_text or provided_video, to qualify the media type of the best available variant (or variants in case of equivalent quality), and correspondingly, preview_3D, preview_audio, preview_image, preview_text or preview_video, to distinguish the type of the preview variant (or variants in case of equivalent quality).\n\nNote that these terms do not imply any statement about the quality or format of a digital media file. Therefore, it is recommended to describe the media file in more detail by using the respective LIDO elements and attributes defined for the LIDO Resource Set. As a general recommendation, at a minimum the media file format should be specified by the LIDO formatResource attribute.\n\nDo not confuse the IANA Media Types, formerly known as MIME types, as used for the attribute formatResource with the media type defined as an attribute value for the LIDO Resource Representation element. While the former refers to the type and subtype of the actual media file (e.g., audio/mpeg, image/png, or text/html), the latter differentiates the digital resources by their intended use and generic kind of medium (e.g., provided_audio, preview_image, or provided_text).\n\nThe use of the LIDO Resource Measurement Set may depend on specific use cases of an online service. It is recommended that partners in a data exchange or aggregation context reach an agreement about this.\nThe vocabulary for the type attribute of the LIDO Resource Representation element does not provide terms to designate variants of digital resources with respect to data exchange in the long term preservation context. The vocabulary may be extended, if necessary.",

    "description": "Starting in the 1950s the International Labour Office has developed an International Standard Classification of Occupations (isco) allowing classification of occupational activities worldwide. Naturally, this system is not intended to deal with historical information. In recent years, a group of historians and sociologists have started to build upon the 1968 version of isco to create a classification scheme for occupational titles in the 19th and early 20th centuries, called hisco (...). It is tailored to cope with historical changes in the production process, and allows storage of information on product and status that could not be accommodated in isco. Large historical databases from which the hisco-data are taken and the international association of historians working on censuses have already agreed to adopt it, an many individual researchers are expected to do so as well.\n\nAltogether, the HISCO scheme was originally based on the coding of the 1,000 most frequent male and female occupational titles in datasets from eight different countries: Belgium, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. The occupational data which were employed to develop the scheme span the period 1690-1970, but are mostly from the nineteenth century. They contain titles declared by or recorded for people of all ages in parish and civil registration documents. The data used to create HISCO encompass the largest country in western Europe, the world’s first industrial nation, the two most influential of the Scandinavian territories, and a newly-settled region of French-Canada. This, and an emphasis on variations within economies in sampling design, ensures that they provide a good mix of agricultural, industrial and commercial activities, of old and new technologies, of traditional and modern forms of organization. Moreover, the inclusion of two French-speaking populations, and a further region in which the official language was French, provides an effective test of the HISCO scheme’s sensitivity to the relationship between language and meaning. Nevertheless, the scheme is currently limited in coverage to the Northern European and Atlantic economies. Future development of the scheme will broaden its scope. To this end, the coding of new data into HISCO is being undertaken in several other countries.\n\nThe History of Work Information System has a coding section that helps users code their data in HISCO, and thus both make it comparable to other datasets, and make it of use to other scholars. The Provenance file lists all contributors to the HISCO-database.",

    "description": "Video games are extremely popular materials held by both public libraries and academic libraries. There is a compelling need for a robust genre vocabulary for cataloging video games that will aid users in identifying video game titles by genre. (...) The OLAC video game genre vocabulary includes sixty-six genre terms, each with a scope note to help librarians choose the correct term when cataloging video games. The vocabulary is fully cross-referenced and includes authoritative sources to corroborate the usage of the genre term as applied to video games. (...) The OLAC video game genre vocabulary has been assigned the MARC source code of olacvggt for use in identifying the source of vocabulary genre terms assigned in bibliographic records for individual video game titles. The designated olacvggt code appears in the Genre/Form Code and Term Source Codes list which is maintained by the Library of Congress, http://www.loc.gov/standards/sourcelist/genre-form.html. (...) OLAC strongly encourages the cataloging community to embrace the use of the authorized OLAC terms in the OLAC video game genre vocabulary when cataloging video games for their collections.",

    "description": "The UPIANA Classification Schedule forms part of a set of three special classification schedules developed by the Cataloging and Metadata Services Section of the University of the Philippines Diliman University Library. It was designed to meet an urgent need in the classification of its various special collections. While the University Library has chosen to adopt the United States Library of Congress Classification Schedules (LCC), catalogers have found it to be inadequate in handling most of the Filipiniana materials. (...) UPIANA is defined to include all officially published and/or unpublished materials emanating from and/or pertaining to the University of the Philippines System. The classification schedule developed in 1961 expanded the LC schedule for individual institutions offering higher education. Since then, it has undergone numerous revisions in order to incorporate the additions and changes in the University organization. Notable revisions of the schedule were carried out in 1975 by Vyva M. Aguirre as part of her Master of Library Science special problem, and by the C Section in 1982 and 2000. This present publication includes the additions and changes made as of March 2018. It does not cover serial publications which, as a standard practice, are not classified, nor does it provide for publications by individual faculty members, alumni, and students of the University on specific subject fields as these are preferably classified under the various classes in the LC Scheme. The UPIANA Classification Schedule is a customized scheme for the University of the Philippines System that may be adopted and or used as a model by other higher education institution libraries with similar needs. Like the LC Scheme, it is found to be functional and logically designed to serve as an organizing system for special and local collections. It is envisioned that libraries who are just beginning to develop similar schemes would find this tool useful for their own purpose.",

It is one of the series of IUPAC 'Colour Books' on chemical nomenclature, terminology, symbols and units (see the list of source documents), and collects together terminology definitions from IUPAC recommendations already published in Pure and Applied Chemistry and in the other Colour Books.\n\nTerminology definitions published by IUPAC are drafted by international committees of experts in the appropriate chemistry sub-disciplines, and ratified by IUPAC's Interdivisional Committee on Terminology, Nomenclature and Symbols (ICTNS). In this edition of the Compendium these IUPAC-approved definitions are supplemented with some definitions from ISO and from the International Vocabulary of Basic and General Terms in Metrology; both these sources are recognised by IUPAC as authoritative. The result is a collection of nearly 7000 terms, with authoritative definitions, spanning the whole range of chemistry.\n\nSome minor editorial changes were made to the originally published definitions, to harmonise the presentation and to clarify their applicability, if this is limited to a particular sub-discipline. Verbal definitions of terms from Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry (the IUPAC Green Book, in which definitions are generally given as mathematical expressions) were developed specially for this Compendium by the Physical Chemistry Division of IUPAC. Definitions of a few physicochemical terms not mentioned in the Green Book were added at the same time (referred to here as Physical Chemistry Division, unpublished).\n\nThe first reference given at the end of each definition is to the page of Pure Appl. Chem. or other source where the original definition appears; other references given designate other places where compatible definitions of the same term or additional information may be found, in other IUPAC documents. The complete reference citations are given in the appended list of source documents. Highlighted terms within individual definitions link to other entries where additional information is available.",

Nomenclature for chemical compounds additionally contains an explicit or implied relationship to the structure of the compound, in order that the reader or listener can deduce the structure from the name. This purpose requires a system of principles and rules, the application of which gives rise to a systematic nomenclature. Of course, a wide range of traditional names, semisystematic or trivial, are also in use for a core group of common compounds. Detailing the latest rules and international practice, this new volume can be considered a guide to the essential organic chemical nomenclature, commonly described as the 'Blue Book'.

By standardising concepts to one single subject heading, the Thesaurus forms the basis for a common terminology within the Department.\n\nMeSH (medical Subject Headings) produced by the US National Library of Medicine has been used as the basis of the medical terms and the corresponding hierarchical schedules in the Health Thesaurus. We are very grateful for their permission to use MeSH in this way. For this edition 2004 MeSH has been used. Within the Department the Thesaurus has been used for the subject metadata element for the Departmental internet, to structure the relationship of terms in the Senior's Portal consumer website, to provide the automatic match of search terms for consumer health access in the HealthInsite gateway, and to give quality subject retrieval in the Library catalogue - which in turn allows easier access to Departmental and other publications. The Thesaurus is also used by a number of health related organisations in Australia. The Thesaurus can be used for classification or indexing of all types of documents and files, from personal files to corporate databases, and hence to assist in retrieval of corporate information. It is also used in Document management and Record management systems.",

The KBpedia knowledge structure combines seven 'core' public knowledge bases — Wikipedia, Wikidata, schema.org, DBpedia, GeoNames, OpenCyc, and UMBEL — into an integrated whole. KBpedia's upper structure, or knowledge graph, is the KBpedia Knowledge Ontology. We base KKO on the universal categories and knowledge representation theories of the great 19th century American logician, polymath and scientist, Charles Sanders Peirce.\n\nKBpedia, written primarily in OWL 2, includes 55,000 reference concepts, mapped linkages to about 32 million entities (most from Wikidata), and 5,000 relations and properties, all organized according to about 70 modular typologies that can be readily substituted or expanded. We test candidates added to KBpedia using a rigorous (but still fallible) suite of logic and consistency tests — and best practices — before acceptance. The result is a flexible and computable knowledge graph that can be sliced-and-diced and configured for all sorts of machine learning tasks, including supervised, unsupervised and deep learning.\n\nKBpedia, KKO and its mapped information can drive multiple use cases such as providing a computable framework over Wikipedia and Wikidata, creating word embedding models, fine-grained entity recognition and tagging, relation and sentiment extractors, and categorization. Knowledge-based AI models may be set up and refined with unprecedented speed and accuracy by leveraging the integrated KBpedia structure.",

The purpose is to facilitate unambiguous electronic communication of quantities together with their units. The focus is on electronic communication, as opposed to communication between humans. A typical application of The Unified Code for Units of Measure are electronic data interchange (EDI) protocols, but there is nothing that prevents it from being used in other types of machine communication. How does it relate?\n\nThe Unified Code for Units of Measure is inspired by and heavily based on ISO 2955-1983, ANSI X3.50-1986, and HL7's extensions called ISO+. The respective ISO and ANSI standards are both entitled Representation of [...] units in systems with limited character sets where ISO 2955 refers to SI and other units provided by ISO 1000-1981, while ANSI X3.50 extends ISO 2955 to include U.S. customary units. Because these standards carry the restriction of limited character sets in their names they seem to be of less value today where graphical user interface and laser printers are in wide-spread use, which is why the european standard ENV 12435 in its clause 7.3 declares ISO 2955 obsolete.\n\nENV 12435 is dedicated exclusively to the communication of measurements between humans in display and print, and does not provide codes that can be used in communication between systems. It does not even provide a specification that would allow communication of units from one system to the screen or printer of another system. The issue about displaying units in the common style defined by the 9th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM) in 1947 is not just the character set. Although The Unicode Standard and its predecessor ISO/IEC 10646 is the richest character set ever it is still not enough to specify the presentation of units because there are important typographical details such as superscripts, subscripts, roman and italics.\"\n\nSeveral URI namespaces and encoding methods have been proposed to map UCUM codes to URIs.",

    "description": "LOINC was initiated in 1994 by Clem McDonald, an investigator at the Regenstrief Institute, which is an internationally respected non-profit medical research organization associated with Indiana University. Regenstrief organized the LOINC committee to develop a common terminology for laboratory and clinical observations because there was a growing trend to send clinical data electronically from laboratories and other data producers to hospitals, physician's offices, and payers who use the data for clinical care and management purposes.\n\nAt the time, and still today, most laboratories and clinical services use HL7 to send their results electronically from their reporting systems to their care systems. However, the tests in these messages are identified by means of their internal, idiosyncratic code values. As a result, receiving care system cannot fully \"understand\" and properly file the results they receive unless they either adopt the producer's test codes (which is impossible if they receive results from multiple sources), or invest in the work to map each result producer's code system to their internal code system.\n\nHere's the problem that LOINC solves: LOINC provides universal codes and names that provide the global lingua franca for identifying tests and observations.",

    "description": "PhySH (Physics Subject Headings) is a physics classification scheme developed by the American Physical Society to organize journals, meetings, and other content by topic. The development of PhySH is motivated by the lack of a fully open, high quality classification scheme for physics. It is intended initially to meet the specific goals of the APS for our journal, meeting, and other content. A longer term goal is to make it available for use by the broader community. (...) Right now, the main use of PhySH is to classify manuscripts within the APS peer-review process and, ultimately, published journal articles. The assigned concepts will be used for ensuring articles are routed to the most appropriate handling editor who is knowledgeable in that area. They also help editors in finding similar articles previously submitted and in finding suitable referees.\n\nAs one might expect with something so new, the refinement of PhySH is still very much underway. The facets and disciplines have been identified and almost 3,000 concepts have been added to PhySH through an iterative process that is still ongoing. Many APS journal editors are involved in this process, primarily by lending their expertise in the various subfields in physics. The assignment of concepts to the various facets can be rather subjective. Thus, we expect to make many adjustments to PhySH as we receive feedback from the community (especially authors using PhySH to classify their submissions) and as we incorporate PhySH into the APS journal websites. As we iteratively refine PhySH over the coming months, the rate of new concept additions, concept reassignments within facets, and new relationships among concepts should abate significantly.",

Also, ELSST is versioned, meaning that outdated concepts (keywords) are deprecated, not deleted. This is important for the application of the FAIR principles, as deprecated concepts are still linkable in the thesaurus.\n\nPrevious abstract until January 2025:\n\"The Humanities and Social Science Electronic Thesaurus (HASSET) is the leading British English thesaurus for the social sciences. It was originally developed from the UNESCO thesaurus, becoming a separate product in 1997.  HASSET is a working tool for the keyword annotation and retrieval of UK Data Service data. It consists of over 4,000 concepts and covers the core social science disciplines: politics, sociology, economics, education, law, crime, demography, health, employment, information and communication technology, history and, increasingly, environmental science.\nThe thesaurus can be used to find studies in the UK Data Service Data Catalogue. These studies include large-scale government surveys, international macrodata, business microdata, qualitative studies, historical studies and census data.\nRevisions to HASSET concepts and structures aim to keep abreast with developments in social science and humanities.",

    "description": "The 'Decimal Classification' was first printed by the National Petroleum Publishing Company, publishers of National Petroleum News, in 1928. A second edition appeared in serial form in The Petroleum Engineer in 1938 and was later reprinted in booklet form. During the intervening years since it was first available, many persons apparently have found this system useful in meeting their filing problems. Articles printed in The Petroleum Engineer have for many years been numbered in accordance with this decimal classification to facilitate orderly clipping and filing. It has also found use in oil company offices and libraries where filing of petroleum technology reference material is a day-to-day problem. (...) From the standpoint of one interested in some specialized industry, such as petroleum, the system developed by Dewey is too broad. Being all inclusive, it subordinates the particular things in which we are interested to the main divisions of knowledge in such a way that much of our material is widely scattered. The decimal classification given in the following pages is modeled after the plan used by Dewey, except that all knowledge is subordinated to the field of petroleum technology, to which the\n\nwhole classification applies. It is intended to provide an orderly and systematic arrangement of reference material for individuals whose chief interest lies in the field of petroleum technology. The main framework of the classification is indicated in the abridged list of 100 topics or subdivisions of petroleum technology (...). In the complete index, which appears on later pages, each division in this list is divided into ten subdivisions, thus providing 1, 000 topics with a number between 0 and 1, 000 assigned to each. Each number is followed by a decimal point, and additional digits may be added to the right of the decimal point if our needs require more detailed classification. The decimal point is used merely for convenience in reading and has no special significance. An effort has been made to include in the classification a number for every topic of any importance pertaining to the petroleum and related industries. When topics have been overlooked, it should be easy to extend the classification, where necessary, by providing a number that would place the topic in its proper sequence with relation to other topics.",

He began work on it about 1880 and published the first schedules in the early 1890s. His five-volume catalogue of the Athenaeum collection is a classic in bibliographic history. The Cutter classification, although adopted by comparatively few libraries, mostly in New England, has been called one of the most logical and scholarly of American classifications. Its outline served as a basis for the Library of Congress classification, which also took over some of its features. It did not catch on as did Dewey's system because Cutter died before it was completely finished, making no provision for the kind of development necessary as the bounds of knowledge expanded and scholarly emphases changed throughout the 20th century.",

    "description": "The Billings Classification is a subject classification developed by John Shaw Billings in 1899. It was not an abstract experiment in the mapping of human knowledge, but rather a system devised specifically for the optimum arrangement of the Library’s collections. Dr. Billings envisioned a layout for the building, and while his classification scheme was in fact a division of human intellectual achievement into various subject areas designated by letter codes varying in number (usually three), it was fashioned in such a way as to maximize access to the unique holdings of the Library. The planned physical space—how things would function—all played a role in the construction of his classification. The majority of the Billings classmarks are not longer in use, as NYPL began using a fixed order system in the 1950s.",

    "description": "There are big changes underway in bird taxonomy. You've probably noticed that the checklist is always changing. Suddenly the ducks have replaced the loons in front of the NGS guide. Not too long ago the shrikes and vireos were next to the warblers, now they're next to the jays. Maybe you've heard that vultures are storks, or that they're not really storks after all, or that North American tanagers are now cardinals, or that saltators are tanagers, not cardinals. Then there are the Baltimore and Bullock's Orioles, or are they just Northern Orioles? Are they Slate-colored and Oregon Juncos, or maybe it's Dark-eyed Junco today. Not only are species being split or lumped, but everything is being rearranged. A new view of bird taxonomy takes shape as we watch.\n\nThere have always been questions and disagreements about bird taxonomy, and it has always been changing (see Bruce, 2003). Since Aristotle or before, people have tried to find a natural way to order all bird species (the very words 'genus' and 'species' carry the Aristotelean tradition). Early attempts were based on obvious similarities, such as grouping all waterbirds together. But what constitutes a natural order?\n\nLinnaeus simplified scientific nomenclature by naming each type bird with a genus and species, but was unable to tell us what order was natural. It is not until Darwin that we get a clearcut way to order the birds. They should be ordered according to descent. Birds with more recent common ancestors should be grouped together.\n\nThomas Huxley (1867) was the first to construct a comprehensive bird list on Darwinian lines. He focused on the characteristics of the bird's skull to determine common inherited features that he could base his taxonomy on. Numerous other ornithologists have used morphological traits to classify the birds, with Livezey and Zusi (2007) being the most recent effort of this type.\n\nMore recently, focus has shifted to molecular methods, the most important of which is to directly study the stuff of inheritance—DNA. The culmination of the first wave of DNA based taxonomy were the publications by Sibley, Ahlquist, and Monroe (Sibley, Ahlquist, and Monroe, 1988; Sibley and Ahlquist, 1990; Sibley and Monroe, 1990). Sibley, Ahlquist, and Monroe used DNA hybridization to try to classify birds. This, together with increasing emphasis on cladistic methods, has revitalized interest in bird taxonomy. In the 1990's, DNA hybridization was replaced by the much more precise DNA sequencing, allowing direct examination of the genes themselves. This has opened the possibility of constructing a 'tree of life' showing the evolutionary relationships between all living organisms. It has brought the prospect of producing a completely accurate taxonomic tree of all living bird species, and touched off an onslaught of new research. This ongoing research is the driving force behind the checklist changes.\n\nThis set of web pages contains a guess at what the avian part of the tree of life might look like. It examines recent taxonomic changes, and possible changes to come. Some of the projected changes are pretty solid, others are guesses based on current research. Keep in mind that some of my guesses will turn out to be wrong, and some of the research they are based will be wrong or misleading. There will doubtless be taxonomic surprises before the entire avian tree is worked out, just as there have been a number of recent surprises.",

    "description": "The present update extends the continuous bibliography of the author in the HethitologiePortal with a systematic classification that facilitates access and orientation in new scientific production according to different thematic and methodological aspects as well as specializations in the field of hittitology and anatolian archeology The necessary extension to related disciplines and adjacent areas.\n\nThus, the systematic bibliography of Hittitology is based, the last period of which was the starting point of this new data collection. Within the framework of a small project funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), the extensive older part of the bibliography for the system was developed, corrected and supplemented between 2009 and the beginning of 2012. The processed material should, as far as possible, open up all the hitherto literature from the beginning, especially since the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nThe classification and arrangement system corresponds to that of the systematic bibliography of the Hethitology of V. Souček and J. Siegelová, which divided the literature into nine large groups - general, archeology, writing, languages, geography, social, history, religion, cultural history. Within these groups a finer arrangement is then made according to the thematic orientation of the works to be treated, with the aim that the increasing amounts of data remain clear, accessible and user-friendly. The complete overview of the classification can be found in the introductory table. By clicking on the individual links in the decimal scheme, the individual topics can be opened.\n\nHowever, there are only a few publications focusing on a single problem. It is a great advantage of the electronic processing of bibliographical data that the works can be recorded in several relevant places and can be referenced by links. The basic classification, of course, is guided by the main theme. The broadening topics or the questions which are treated only in an additional way in the respective work are taken into account by the publication in the corresponding chapter 'under the line', ie. Only after the works in which the relevant problem circle is the focus.",

Since its enactment, it has been revised based on classification tables and explanatory materials four times, reflecting the revision results of SITC and HS, which are related product categories. The first and second amendments to the U.N. recommended were table amendments that reflected the SITC amendments, the third correction corrected errors in the BEC technology, and the fourth amendment was made with the relevant table amendments that reflected the HS amendments.\nThe revision of the BEC was carried out in parallel with the revision of the KCPC (Korea Goods and Service Classification) in March 2018, and the final revision classification system was finalized and operated in December 2018 after three rounds of meetings with statistical authorities and public opinion collection and classification experts.

    "description": "It is the job classification that systematically types what individuals are doing for income (economic activities) according to the type of work performed, and the Korean Standard Classification of Occupations (KSCO) is standardized to suit the job structure and status of Korea.\nThe Korean standard occupation classification is based on the ability to carry out the tasks and tasks of a given job, and is considering the job level and type of job. Skill level refers to the height of job performance, which is determined by regular education, vocational training, vocational experience, and innate ability and socio-cultural environment. Skill specialization relates to the field of knowledge required to perform a task, the tools and equipment used, the raw materials input, and the types of goods or services produced.\nAn occupation is a group of jobs that have similar task similarities. Distinguishing a set of tasks from other occupations and classifying them into the same profession presupposes a degree of similarity, which is equivalent to presenting job-specific job exclusivity that defines different tasks. However, it is very difficult to determine task-specific similarities and exclusivity due to the complexity of job performance conditions and the gap in job scope due to differences in the size of the enterprise.\nThe criteria for task similarity include knowledge, experience, and skill required by the person performing the task, as well as the skill requirements required by the person performing the task. Sometimes, the characteristics of companies where professionals mainly work, the process of production, or the final output, are important. Non-similar jobs can be called different jobs because the requirements of exclusivity are met, and if the labor market formation varies from job to job, it can be said that they have the most obvious exclusivity.\nIn addition, the size of employment by job is also a realistic criterion in the task categorization criterion. The Korean Standard Occupational Classification was established based on the employment of at least 1,000 people in the class unit, and 5,000 to 10,000 people are believed to be distributed in the class with a large number of employees.",

    "description": "The purpose of the Basic Concepts Classification is first to identify an extensive and hierarchically organized set of ‘basic concepts’: concepts that can readily be understood across disciplines and cultures. Second, all scholarly works can be classified in terms of combinations of these basic concepts. The Basic Concepts Classification thus provides a basis for a universal non-discipline-based classification.\n\nThere are three broad types of basic concept. Most basic concepts refer to real (or abstract) ‘things’ (phenomena) in the world (or to properties of those things). Yet there are also various relationships among things. Since the bulk of scholarly research -- and much of the general literature as well -- analyses how one or more things influence (or are related in other ways to) one or more other things, it is desirable to classify such works in terms of combinations of basic concepts. An important minority of scholarly works discusses the properties of one or more things or relationships. These adjective/adverbial properties form a third group of basic concepts. These properties can be combined with both things and relationships to more precisely capture the important elements of both types of work.",

Consumers will choose to purchase directly overseas if the price of the goods is cheaper than in Korea, considering the price, tariffs and delivery costs of the goods. At this time, I wanted to know the estimated tariff amount of the goods I wanted to purchase, but it was difficult to check the tariff rate because the terms in the tariff rate table were different from the terms used in real life. The tariff rate requires the item number on the tariff rate table. However, many jargon is used in the tariff table because it follows the classification system under international agreements. This booklet explains the jargon of the tariff table in an encyclopedia definition and a picture of goods, and links the name of the tariff table used in daily life with the name of the tariff table through the index table, making it easier for the general public to understand the tariff table.",

When importing or exporting new products, the appropriate item number is reported to the customs office, and the item number (item classification) applied is a key factor in determining the country of origin and complex preferential tariffs between the countries in the free trade agreement (FTA). In particular, customs officials are having difficulty in determining the exact meaning of tariff rate table terminology when classifying items. Furthermore, in addition to the tariff rate table documentation, careful consideration is required, such as criteria for application of item classification, comments on HS classification, and regulations related to item classification by other departments. In order to easily understand the jargon (about 9,600) of the tariff rate table or tariff rate table manuals, the encyclopedia was defined, photographs, etc., and other departments' regulations on item classification (164), WCOHS classification opinions (94), etc. were published in advance.",

It covers all esoteric subjects, including (but of course not limited to):\n\n Astrology; Arthurian legend; fiction (SF, fantasy, historical and mythological); religions (comparitive, Paganism, Wicca, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Taoism, Christianity and many others); occult teachings; magic (or magick) in numerous categories; divination; Tarot; Runes; reincarnation; Qabala (spelling optional); UFOs; ESP; astral projection; channelling; clairvoyance; philosophy; psychology; prophecy; Earth mysteries; environmental issues; sustainable living; alternative technology.\n\n The classification system is sufficiently flexible to allow the creation of new categories, which is done whenever a subject group appears to require subdivision.",

Also, it is hard to learn because the terms are long, and it is difficult for foreigners to follow in Korean. Meanwhile, the need for a standard vocabulary book for taekwondo has become more urgent as the terms of competition and demonstration have not been properly organized in the textbook, causing confusion of terms by team or demonstration team.\nAccordingly, Kukkiwon collects and reviews the various terms used in the painting and the stadium, selects 138 standard terms, and publishes a glossary with descriptions of each technique.\nThe standard terms in Taekwondo Technical Glossary have realized consistency, unity and simplicity of terms. In addition, we have expanded the method of technology, direction of technology, and technology that has not been included in the textbook. In the future, new technology names can be consistently established, and it is easy to learn and use as it can be short pronunciations of the command within five syllables at the training site. In addition, the Romanization of the National Institute of Korean Language, the name of Taekwondo technology can be called the same anywhere in the world by using the Romanization method.",

It is composed of two sections: the index and the white paper. The Encyclopedia of Korean Seasonal Customs has been published in four volumes, divided according to the characteristics of seasonal customs that follow the cycle of the four seasons: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. However, since the first month of the lunar calendar, Jeongwol (the lunar January), is the period with the most seasonal customs, it has been published as a separate volume. This encyclopedia is mainly divided into lunar and solar calendars. The lunar section includes major events like Seollal (Lunar New Year) and Daeboreum (the first full moon), as well as seasonal terms such as Ipchun (beginning of spring) and Usu (rainwater), along with monthly customs and livelihoods.\n\nThe encyclopedia can be browsed in the same way as a typical dictionary by looking up headwords, or it can be read as a cohesive work with an organic structure, like a monograph. Therefore, it is efficient for both finding specific pieces of information and studying the overall seasonal customs of Jeongwol. Starting with the Jeongwol volume, the encyclopedia was published in the following order: Spring, Autumn, Winter, Appendices, and the Index volume.",

    "description": "The Land Use Terminology Dictionary is a specialized dictionary that compiles terms related to land use regulation. It was first published by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport in 2009 in book form, and was revised in 2010 to be available through the Land Use Regulation Information Service. Since then, as the Land Use Regulation Information Service was renamed \"Tongji-eum\", the dictionary has been provided as an online resource on the website, with the option to download PDF files. Previous versions of the dictionary (2011, May 2016, December 2016, December 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024) can be accessed in the Resource Room of the Information Hall.\n\nLand Use Terminology Dictionary Disclaimer (January 2011 version)\n1. To make it easier for anyone to understand the land use information provided by the Land Use Regulation Information System, the terms related to the area, district, etc., building use under the Building Act, urban planning facilities under the National Land Planning and Utilization Act, and other relevant laws were selected.\n2. Each term consists of table control, terminology type, related laws, terminology description, and related terms (see 'Example of Term Preparation').\n3. The terms in the term list are arranged in alphabetical order for convenience of use, and consist of the words in table control, term descriptions, and reference terms (see 'Terms list description').\n4. In principle, the term description includes definitions of terms, background of introduction, location and decision criteria, subdivisions, and reference terms, and is prepared by referring to relevant statutes and relevant department policy data.\n5. In order to easily identify the link between terms, we have prepared a regional classification table, a building purpose classification table, and an urban planning facility classification table. You can find it in the term classification table.\n6. Terms are divided into legal and professional terms, and legal terms are faithfully reflected in the legal definitions, location, and decision criteria stipulated in the relevant statutes. The jargon was prepared using urban planning, architectural dictionaries, encyclopedias, and Korean dictionaries.\n7. However, various statistical data presented to assist the understanding were prepared based on the time when the relevant administrative agencies investigated and published.\n8. The term explanation was not limited to the specific laws, but rather summarized in various laws related to the terms. For example, in the case of roads, various laws such as the Building Act, the National Land Planning and Utilization Act, the Road Act, and the Private Investigation Act are operated differently in accordance with the purpose of legislation, and the contents prescribed by each law are mentioned together. Therefore, when using for a specific purpose, such as permission or permission, the definitions, location and decision criteria, behavioral restrictions, and permission criteria set forth in individual statutes must be checked and followed.",

    "description": "Geographic Information Systems have become indispensable tools in managing and displaying marine data and information. However, a unique georeferenced standard of marine place names and areas was not available, hampering several marine geographic applications, for example the linking of these locations to databases to integrate data. The purpose of Marine Regions is therefore to create a standard, relational list of geographic names, coupled with information and maps of the geographic location of these features. This will improve access and clarity of the different geographic, marine names such as seas, sandbanks, ridges and bays and display univocally the boundaries of marine biogeographic or managerial marine areas.\n\nMarine Regions is an integration of the VLIMAR Gazetteer and the VLIZ Maritime Boundaries Geodatabase. The VLIMAR Gazetteer is a database with geographic, mainly marine names such as seas, sandbanks, seamounts, ridges, bays or even standard sampling stations used in marine research. The geographic cover of the VLIMAR gazetteer is global but initially focused on the Belgian Continental Shelf and the Scheldt Estuary and the Southern Bight of the North Sea. Gradually more regional and global geographic information was added to VLIMAR and combining this information with the Maritime Boundaries database, representing the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the world, led to the creation of marineregions.org.\n\nMarine Regions is managed by the Flanders Marine Institute. Funding for the creation of the VLIMAR gazetteer was provided initially through the EU Network of Excellence MarBEF, but also other European initiative such as EMODNet and Lifewatch provide the necessary funding for the maintenance and management of Marine Regions.\n\nWith the launch of marineregions.org, we are also aiming at the establishment of an international editorial board, responsible for the content, quality control and promotion of Marine Regions.",

If you don't know exactly what this study is about, no matter how hard you study and how good you get, you won't be able to disclose information or exchange information with other researchers, so it's just self-satisfaction. Therefore, they first go through compassion to find out what their materials are, and although they are often easily published in pictures or photographs, it is most desirable to compare them with professional literature or samples already sympathetic for accurate compassion.\nTo this end, the insect industry department of the National Institute of Agricultural Science collects samples from all over the country every year, focusing on pests that damage crops and natural enemy insects that parasitize or eat pests.\nAs evidence of the findings, the Insect Specimens Center samples and stores the material insects used in the study, making them available to other researchers and providing information related to insect and crop pests.",

Paste all Korean terms.\n4. Remove suffixes (~phase, ~sex, ~alcohol, ~yang, ~positive, ~symptoms, ~symptoms, ~type) after nouns, but keep them in parentheses if they are not familiar with these changes or are not distinguishable from similar foreign terms.\n5. In the case of scientific names, the generic name is (subject). If it is a species name, attach (species) and display it in italic font.\n6. Attach '-' after adjectives to distinguish between nouns.\n7. Erase 's after noun.\n8. Delete the '-' between nouns and maintain the '-' between proper nouns.\n9. Delete terms that were not used well in previous editions, and add new medical terms or new drug names based on Harrison's Internal Medicine Textbook (19 editions).\n10. Refer to the Korean Medical Association's Medical Terminology (5 editions), Harrison's Internal Medicine Textbook (19 editions), Wikipedia, PubMed, etc. as the basis for the wording.",

The Korean name for parasites of the progenitor subfamily and the epigenetic subfamily was widely collected according to the 1994 Korean Species of Species, but only the arthropod sentence was taken from the manuscript of the \"Korean insect masterpiece (1994).\nThe newly designated Korean word parasite may be more desirable if it is beautiful and easy to call, but it is not always possible, especially considering the principle of keeping usefulness and grammar. Previously used Korean parasites tried to strictly protect the permanence of the language by recognizing it as it was without any special errors.\nThere were many exceptions despite the fact that various principles, both large and small, were established and the work was carried out, and this is the characteristic of the term. As set forth this time, I hope that we will continue to observe what problems are there and share opinions to create more desirable Korean names and use each other in the future. And the parasite scientist who picked up the new parasite hopes that the parasite's Korean name will be carefully named and proposed so that the proposal will be respected.",

    "description": "The MoEML Gazetteer of Early Modern London is a descriptive gazetteer in that each place is linked to an Encyclopedia page with a 'thick description' of place. (...) Until now, there has been no digital gazetteer and authority list for placenames in early modern London. Our gazetteer offers a standard for placenames ca. 1550-1650.1 Such a standard enables interoperability across digital projects that include early modern London placenames. Shakeosphere and DEEP have already used our gazetteer to identify toponyms in their data and link to MoEML. We hope that other scholars, editors, and researchers will adopt these authority names in secondary criticism, in modernized editions of early texts, and in datasets that include a geographic component. The gazetteer also allows us to aggregate many variant names that have been given to a place. We define place as a space that has been made meaningful by human activity or observation. The existence of a toponym is one sign that space has become place. Furthermore, toponyms often preserve a memory of why a place is significant. Thus, toponyms are intrinsically interesting to scholars of language, history, and onomastics (the study of the origin of proper names).",

As your enthusiasm and efforts to make good medical terms are concentrated, it seems that you have been negligent in introducing and deciding the terms needed for new medical technology. In the future, the Medical Terminology Committee will work harder to gather opinions from each conference and to introduce and standardize new medical terms for modern medicine.\nTo spread medical terminology, the Medical Terminating Commission has been running its website since 2001, providing infrastructure to search for the latest terminology in real time and access relevant information. In September 2015, the 5th album of medical terms of the Medical Association of Physicians was published as standard terms, and we hope that this homepage will help you search for and utilize standard medical terms.",

Since May last year, we have organized an in-house T/F and have secured various in-house and external data to collect 3,000 power terms. Afterwards, the final 300 power terms were selected through heated meetings, including professors and ordinary people, the National Institute of Korean Language, and various associations related to the power industry. Through this work, difficult Chinese characters and abbreviations were improved to easy terms, awkward foreign words were changed according to the notation, and the appropriate representative terms were unified when mixed. In the wake of the purification of power terms, KEPCO will minimize the use of unnecessary foreign words and continue to improve them by identifying unidentified terms, Japanese expressions, Konglish, and authoritative terms. We will make efforts to purify unfamiliar and difficult words so that people can easily understand them and communicate them at the eyes of the people.",

    "description": "STRUNA is a database of Croatian Special Field Terminology. It was officially inaugurated on the web in February 2012. Its aim is to gradually make available to the public the standardized Croatian terminology for all professional domains.\n\nThe Development of Croatian Special Field Terminology project started in 2007 as part of the initial coordination project launched at the initiative of the Croatian Standard Language Council, and has since been financed by the Croatian Science Foundation. The program supports the strategic values of the Foundation and fits into two basic areas of the National Strategy for Science Development – development of information technology and sociocultural transition from an industrial to a knowledge-based society. The Institute of Croatian Language and Linguistics was chosen to serve as the national coordinator.\n\nGiven the pivotal role terminology plays in language development as well as professional communication, the objective of the program in a broader sense is to lay the foundation for the development of national terminology policy, to establish various forms of more structured education in this field, and to intensify long-term cooperation with national and international academic and other institutions dealing with different aspects of terminology work, with the Croatian Standards Institute and with other interested parties. (...)\n\nExperts from eighteen domains have so far joined the program with the aim of standardazing the terminology of their respective disciplines. Currently available for search are the terminologies of the following domains: aviation and air traffic, cartography and geoinformatics, chemistry, civil engineering, corrosion, dental medicine, marine engineering, mechanical engineering, polymers, and physics. Maritime terminology, anthropological terminology, and EU law terminology are in the final stage and the domains of phytomedicine, mathematics and archaeology in the process of joining the program.",

They made 9.8 million visits and 56 million searches in that time. According to annual user surveys carried out by Fiontar since 2010, the site is primarily used by translators and interpreters and by university students. (...).\n\nThe first phase of the work was done with funding from INTERREG III A (2004-7). Phase I of the work consisted of digitising and integrating existing paper and electronic lists. Fiontar continues to manage and develop this resource with project funding from Foras na Gaeilge. Many resources have been added under subsequent phases, including collections of sports, arts and legal terms, tools for translation memories and other resources for translators, and a link facility to The New Corpus for Ireland.\n\nPhase V of the project began on 1 June 2014 and, among other things, a collection of computing terms is being developed. Hosting of the National Terminology Database for Irish was transferred from DCU to Tibus in May 2014. Fiontar is responsible for the application, but Tibus is now responsible for the site-hosting (availability, speed, etc). The web address for the National Terminology Database for Irish changed from focal.ie to tearma.ie on 1 March 2015.",

From EU legislation and trade to the needs and mobility of every EU citizen, terminology is the key for easy, fast and reliable communications. However, new EU member countries face the issue of terminology resource fragmentation across different institutions, inconsistency and lack of coordination in terminology development, as well as structural and technical incompatibility.\n\nThe EuroTermBank project results in a centralized online terminology bank for languages of new EU member countries interlinked to other terminology banks and resources. Although EuroTermBank is addressed directly towards Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, the project is open to other new EU member states and interested countries and organizations outside EU. It also enables exchange of terminology data with existing national and EU terminology databases by establishing cooperative relationships, aligning methodologies and standards, designing and implementing data exchange mechanisms and procedures.",

The strength of a standard in a given category is determined by a mixture of its adoption in that category, its design intent, and its overall appropriateness for use in that category.\n\nThe standards represented here are among those most heavily used or publicized in the cultural heritage community, though certainly not all standards that might be relevant are included.

The scope and coverage of the ontology result from the practical requirements of the realization of our knowledge graph and the associated concerns. An essential particularity of our domain is that we model perspectives rather than facts. Therefore, the possibilities of the linked open data paradigm to let complementary and also contradictory statements coexist are very useful to us. This particularity has the consequence that 'reification' (i.e., statements about statements) is an important modeling dimension that includes, among other things, the unambiguous referencing of each statement, including linkage to the dataset to which it can be traced.",

Members contribute by depositing the funding acknowledgements from their publications as part of their standard metadata, together with the unique funder IDs listed in the OFR.

    "description": "The INDIGO Graffiti Thesaurus is a curated academic resource centred on contemporary graffiti terminology, with a spatial focus on the Danube Canal in Vienna, Austria. It is not just a compilation of terms, but also a specialised tool that organises and categorises graffiti-related concepts within a controlled vocabulary. More specifically, it takes the form of a thesaurus, where concepts are connected to each other through equivalence, hierarchical, and associative relationships.\n\nBy leveraging the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) data model, the thesaurus ensures consistency and precision in its representation of information. The use of SKOS not only makes the thesaurus accessible but also interoperable, allowing for seamless integration with other widely used resources such as Wikidata and the Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) of the J. Paul Getty Trust and Getty Research Institute. The thesaurus is inspired by the AAT and therefore also contains information provided under the ODC Attribution License by the Getty Research Institute. Moreover, the content systematically reflects the structure of the AAT by using facets, hierarchy names, and guide terms.\n\nThe thesaurus is made available through the Vocabs service of the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage (ACDH-CH), which utilises Skosmos, an open-source software tailored for publishing vocabularies. For enhanced accessibility, the thesaurus can be queried via a REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface), facilitating its interaction with data over the World Wide Web. Moreover, its availability in diverse data formats, including TSV (Tab-Separated Values) and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), caters to a wide range of academic and technological preferences.\n\nWith its unique focus on the graffiti culture of the Danube Canal, the thesaurus offers a deep insight into Vienna's Danube Canal contemporary graffiti world and serves as a valuable tool for all those interested in this form of creativity.",

(Japanese: 分類 classification) is a name which identifies the Pokémon based on one of its defining biological characteristics. Most often, the defining traits are part of the Pokémon’s physiology, special abilities, or behavior. It was previously also known as species. (...) Because of how brief and uninformative the description of a Pokémon often is in its category, and how little the category relates to other data, it is not often regarded as an important piece of information about a Pokémon. Before Generation III, the category was shown by just seeing the Pokémon, rather than upon catching it. In Pokémon games prior to Generation III, the character limit for a category name was ten characters. This has since increased from Generation III onwards, with the longest English category name being observed to be thirteen characters long. In other languages, the longest category name is Pachirisu's German category 'Elektrohörnchen' which is 15 characters long. This includes spaces but does not include 'Pokémon'.",

VIAF began as a joint project with the Library of Congress (LC), the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek (DNB), the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BNF) and OCLC.

(...)\n\nVIAF helps to make library authority files less expensive to maintain and more generally useful to the library domain and beyond. To achieve this, VIAF matches and links the authority files of national libraries and groups all authority records for a given entity into a merged 'super' authority record that brings together the different names for that entity. By linking disparate names for the same person or organization, VIAF provides a convenient means for a wider community of libraries and other agencies to repurpose bibliographic data produced by libraries serving different language communities.",

To this end, terms have been collected since 1993 under the goal of constructing metadata for Korean terms that have a relationship between semantic information and terms, and they have been described as standard thesaurus structure. Thesaurus is widely known as a form of structuring terms and concisely abstracts complex relationships between terms. In this dictionary, the standard thesaurus structure is basically adopted and additionally expanded.\n\nThe subject of the registered terms includes nouns such as subject name, life, institution/organization name, place name, animal name, plant name, legal name, literature name, monument name, product name, meeting/assembly name, event name, etc., and verbs and adjectives. As of August 2013, 1.3 million terms (800,000 terms in Korean, 510,000 terms in foreign language. See statistical functions for more information) were registered and terminology relationships were defined. Although it is not yet sufficient, it is thought that we have constructed a sufficient amount of data to process unstructured data in the field to some extent, so we will disclose the results so far. More than 10,000 terms of new terms are added every month, and this work will continue along with the revision work.",

The terms in SNORRE have been extracted from standards from a wide variety of standardization areas. Examples include Quality, Services, Transport, Food technology, Sports equipment and facilities, Company organization and management, Textile and leather technology, and Shipbuilding and marine structures. The majority of the terms have been extracted from translations. The database therefore comprises a vast amount of building and civil engineering terminology, as this is the standardization area in which most translations are produced. SNORRE also contains many environmental terms. (...) The term base has more than 50 000 entries and more than 200 000 terms and 30 000 definitions. SNORRE is a multilingual terminological database that contains terminology in Norwegian Bokmål, Norwegian Nynorsk and English. Many entries also include German and/or French terms. The following elements are normally to be found in a SNORRE database entry: terms and definitions, notes, sources and subject fields. (...) The SNORRE user interface enables users to make simple search requests among terms, definitions etc. in various languages. Advanced search features are also available. Furthermore, the search results page offers filter functionality that makes it possible to narrow down search results according to source, language and category (terms/definitions), as well as free text search. Users may access term lists based on subject area and lists containing all terms that have been extracted from a specific source. Moreover, the term entries are linked to a product information page where users may collect background information about the referenced sources (standards) and also get a preview of the documents (five pages). (...) SNORRE is the result of a project that was carried out in co-operation with the Language Council of Norway with financial support from the Norwegian Ministry of Culture. The main project objective was to make terminology from standards publicly accessible. The intension was to strengthen the position of the Norwegian language (Bokmål and Nynorsk) through providing the public with valuable Norwegian terminology.",

Unlike these, however, it is narrowly focused on the task of providing a genuine upper ontology which can be used in support of domain ontologies developed for scientific research, as for example in biomedicine within the framework of the OBO Foundry. Thus BFO does not contain physical, chemical, biological or other terms which would properly fall within the special sciences domains.\n\nThe BFO project was initiated in 2002. The theory behind BFO was developed initially by Barry Smith and Pierre Grenon and presented in a series of publications listed here. Since then important contributions to BFO have been made by many people, including: Werner Ceusters, Chris Mungall, Fabian Neuhaus, Holger Stenzhorn, Alan Ruttenberg, Mathias Brochausen, Bjoern Peters, Kerry Trentelman, and by more than hundred other members of the BFO Discussion Group.

In 2000, thanks to the collaboration of the National Foundation for Educational Research in England and Wales (NFER), work began on updating the Thesaurus, taking into account the terminology of the IBE’s new framework programme and the report to UNESCO of the International Commission on Education for the Twenty- First Century, Learning: the treasure within, also known as the Delors report. Many new descriptors were introduced, while changes were made to the terms dealing with teaching and learning methods, and to the educational technology terms. Some descriptors and identifiers were eliminated. At the same time the number of explanatory notes was increased. In 2002, further developments took place with the introduction of new descriptors relating to curriculum and to HIV/AIDS education, in line with the IBE’s new activities. This latest October 2007 revision includes the addition of over 130 new terms, presented in the same format as the 2002 revision, and also available on the Internet in English only. The IBE is indebted to colleagues in the UNESCO Institute of Lifelong Learning, Hamburg, the UNESCO Regional Office for Education in Latin America and the Caribbean, Santiago, and the Caribbean Educational Research Information Service (CERIS), University of the West Indies who collaborated with suggestions for new terms and modifications.\n\nThe UNESCO-IBE Education Thesaurus is an important indexing tool in the education field.

This list is designed to provide name form consistency and, through the use of a \"description\" (DSC) note field, enable users to distinguish between same or similar names and to determine whether the person/name is appropriate to their indexing or searching needs. Geographic Names Thesaurus provides guidance on the preferred and/or current names of geographic and geopolitical entities. It is hierarchically arranged using broader/narrower notation, allowing one to navigate the relationships among region, continent, country, and in some cases, cities. Scope notes briefly detailing the history of country name changes are included along with instructions and restrictions for their use and application.

In 1988, the then chief of the UNHCR Centre for Documentation on Refugees (CDR), Hans Thoolen, invited Jean Aitchison, a respected expert in the field of thesauri, to provide the technical expertise for the revision and restructuring of this draft. She worked closely with the CDR and with an international working group, and the result of their collaboration was the first edition of the International Thesaurus of Refugee Terminology, in three separate language editions, published in 1989. The Spanish version was translated by the Latin American Information Center on Migration (CIMAL) in Santiago de Chile and published by the Instituto Interamericano de Derechos Humanos (IIDH) in Costa Rica. The French edition was translated by Documentation Réfugiés in Paris and published by La Documentation française (France). The English edition was published by UNHCR. We hope this new version will serve as a more efficient medium for identifying relevant indexing terminology and as a value-added mechanism for managing refugee- and forced migration-related information. It is intended as a tool for use by organizations that process information concerning refugees.",

    "description": "The Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) is a 5 level classification system that describes the gross motor function of children and youth with cerebral palsy on the basis of their self-initiated movement with particular emphasis on sitting, walking, and wheeled mobility. Distinctions between levels are based on functional abilities, the need for assistive technology, including hand-held mobility devices (walkers, crutches, or canes) or wheeled mobility, and to a much lesser extent, quality of movement.\n\nThe focus of the GMFCS is on determining which level best represents the child's or youth's present abilities and limitations in gross motor function. Emphasis is on usual performance in home, school, and community settings (i.e., what they do), rather than what they are known to be able to do at their best (capability). It is therefore important to classify current performance in gross motor function and not to include judgments about the quality of movement or prognosis for improvement.\n\nThe GMFCS - E&R includes an age band for youth 12 to 18 years of age and emphasizes the concepts inherent in the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). We encourage users to be aware of the impact that environmental and personal factors may have on what children and youth are observed or reported to do. The descriptions for the 6 to 12 year and 12 to 18 year age bands reflect the potential impact of environment factors (e.g., distances in school and community) and personal factors (e.g., energy demands and social preferences) on methods of mobility.",

This specificity means that some terms and names one might expect in a thesaurus about Los Angeles will not be present. Likewise, general subject hierarchies that may have been constructed to place orphan terms were not developed, although the current structure allows for future development. Part one of the LACBD thesaurus is a common subject thesaurus. Index subject headings from the bibliographies were compiled into a hierarchical thesaurus. Some terms were created or added from other vocabularies to collocate legacy index terms.\n\nPart two is the LACBD Geographic Names Thesaurus. Buildings, streets, institutions and neighborhoods are among the many kinds of geographic names included. Only places that are named in the source bibliographies have been included in the thesaurus, although contemporary names may have been added to provide access for today’s users. Facet nodes based upon the LACBD Subject thesaurus group the geographic names into helpful categories. Part three is the LACBD Personal Names Authority List. Peoples’ names that are indexed in the bibliographies are included in this list. As with the geographic names, facet nodes based upon the LACBD Subject thesaurus group the personal names into categories. There are some persons who elude categorization, and they are grouped under an 'unclassified names' heading.

Exact equivalence is mandatory only for preferred terms (descriptors). Descriptors in French are in the masculine form; for example, \"acteurs\" is preferred, not \"actrices\"; \"techniciens\" is preferred, not \"techniciennes\" or \"technicien(ne)s\". In general, terms are in the form of nouns or noun phrases. The plural form is preferred over the singular; this convention has been observed in both English and French. Terms are in direct (not inverted) format, as they would be in natural speech; for example, \"primary education\" not \"education, primary\"; \"age of head of household\" not \"head of household - age\". Terms may be accompanied, as required, by scope notes which provide a brief explanation of intended coverage or proper usage of a term. The relationships contained in the Thesaurus are hierarchical (broader/narrower), associative (related) or prescriptive (use/used for).",

Their starting point was William Benemann’s Genre terms for law materials: a thesaurus (Buffalo, N.Y.: William S. Hein, 2006). The working group decided to modify the style and wording of some of Benemann’s terms, remove others altogether, and add additional headings. The group also added many cross references and scope notes and reviewed the corresponding LC subject headings for possible harmonization of the two lists. In October 2009 the AALL Cataloging and Classification Committee approved the thesaurus. AALL’s thesaurus also includes approximately twenty terms that are not specific to law. Instead, they represent genres and forms of general reference works that are heavily collected by law and other libraries (e.g., academic theses, dictionaries, and directories).

The structure is fairly flat, with 571 top terms, and a maximum of 3-4 steps in each hierarchy. Subject thesaurus terms are used to describe the subject matter of resources - they describe what resources are about.

This provides for flexibility and precision during resource discovery, because the searcher is able to combine terms to satisfy the particular enquiry. In indexing and retrieval, composite concepts may require the use of two or more keywords. For example, a resource dealing with 'computer network security' would have the TAGS terms 'Computer networks' and 'Security measures' assigned as Subject metadata.\n\nTAGS is a thesaurus of subject terms for use by Australian Government agencies which: covers, at a high level, subject concepts representing the scope of Australian Government activities; provides a potential source of terminology for portal browse lists; and provides a subject vocabulary which is broader than the detailed vocabularies already adopted by some agencies, but which is able to function as an introduction to those detailed vocabularies, or to serve as a controlled vocabulary for those agencies without a specialised one.",

Also at family level, FishBase may follow Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes that is updated more frequently to integrate new stable groupings.\n\n Number of taxa from Orders to Species are given for what they are, a useful tool for information and database management. The design of some analyses (so-called Biodiversity analyses) that uses these numbers must be carefully assessed before processing.\n\n Catalog of Fishes gives also number of species, including available names in the sense of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, which we don't have. Possible discrepancies between the species and genera numbers are explained in Bailly (2010). Finally, Wiley and Johnson (2010) just published a new classification for Teleostei. They propose to stabilize several hypotheses published recently or some (long) time ago by listing the known evidences (synapomorphies). FishBase will follow this new arrangement as soon as the ichthyological community endorses it, e.g., as published in a next version of Fishes of the World.

All taxonomic names are also linked to the verified literature in which they were described, the first compilation of its kind for the Decapoda. To arrive at this compilation, we began with the classification scheme provided by Martin & Davis (2001) for extant families, updated the higher classification and included the fossil taxa. The resultant framework was then populated with the currently valid genera and an estimate of species numbers within each genus. Our resulting classification, spanning both extant (living) and fossil taxa, is the first comprehensive estimate of taxonomic diversity within the entire Decapoda. The classification consists of 233 families of decapods containing 2,725 genera and an estimated 17,635 species (including both extant and fossil species). Of the families in our classification, 53 are exclusively fossil, 109 contain both fossil and extant species, and 71 are extant only. The current estimate for extant species is 14,756, whereas 2,979 species are known exclusively as fossils.",

The sheer number of categories that humans have constructed to contain and order this group is some indication of the incredible amount of morphological diversity they exhibit. But this is only a small part of the overall picture. Even if one were to grasp the full range of taxonomic diversity as presented in this classification, such knowledge would shed no light on the actual biology of these fascinating animals: their behavior, feeding, locomotion, reproduction; their relationships to other organisms; their adaptations to the environment; and other facets of their existence that fall under the heading of biodiversity. By producing this volume we are attempting to update an existing classification, produced by Tom Bowman and Larry Abele (1982), in order to arrange and update the Crustacea collection of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. This enormous and diverse collection contains an estimated four to five million specimens, making it the second largest collection of Crustacea in the Americas. While undertaking this task, it occurred to us that others might benefit from our efforts, and that perhaps a general update on the number and arrangement of the living crustacean families, along with an explanation of the systematic and classificatory changes suggested during the last two decades, might be a welcome addition to the literature.",

ANZSPC was produced in 2001 as a collaboration between the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and Statistics New Zealand. It was intended that the ANZSPC become the statistical standard for the collection and presentation of product statistics in both countries. However, the recent review of product classifications, focusing on the use of ANZSPC within the ABS, found that: ANZSPC has not been adopted widely within the ABS, rather a range of collection specific classifications have been developed; a range of product classifications are required to account for different conceptual bases such as industry of origin, end use and material composition; and ANZSPC is no longer internationally comparable given the impending release of Central Product Classification (CPC) V2.0.\n\nFurthermore, consultation with Statistics New Zealand revealed that the adoption of ANZSPC throughout New Zealand has also been nominal, therefore decommissioning the ANZSPC is seen as a logical and practical approach by Statistics New Zealand.\n\nThe ABS plans to adopt the international CPC V2.0 as the overarching framework for product classifications, that is, product classifications used within the ABS will concord with CPC V2.0 to at least 3 digit level. The CPC is a multipurpose classification covering all goods and services and recent developments to increase the level of detail and comparability with other international standards has positioned it well to fulfil the function of an overarching reference product classification for Australia and New Zealand, taking on the role intended for the ANZSPC.",

Geographic names other than those for neighborhood districts are not included in the subject classification. The second part of the thesaurus is an alphabetical list of terms. It contains both the approved subject terms and other words people commonly use to describe City activities. This part of the thesaurus gives the approved subject term to use in place of unapproved 'lead-in' words. Approved or authorized indexing terms are shown in bold type. The entry for each main term includes references to broader, narrower and related terms. Some terms also have short definitions, or scope notes. A code in the form 'AB 0123' follows each main term in the alphabetical list and precedes each term in the hierarchical subject classification. This notation allow a user to find the location of a term in the hierarchy. The thesaurus contains 1713 authorized terms and 601 lead-in or unauthorized words. The collection of terms in this thesaurus has been designed to permit clear indexing and classification of records in the Seattle City Clerk's office, but it is of limited scope.",

    "description": "The Australian Standard Classification of Drugs of Concern (ASCDC) is the Australian statistical standard for classifying data relating to drugs which are considered to be of concern in Australian society. The ASCDC is essentially a classification of type of drug of concern based on the chemical structure, mechanism of action and effect on physiological activity of the drugs of concern. The classification of Type of Drug is described as the 'main classification structure' throughout the ASCDC document. The ASCDC is intended for use in the collection, classification, storage and dissemination of all statistical, administrative and service delivery data relating to drugs of concern. There are two additional classifications, Form of Drug and Method of Drug Use.\n\nThe ASCDC assists government planners, policy analysts and social researchers by providing a consistent framework for the classification of drug-related data. The use of the standard definitions, classifications and coding procedures detailed in the ASCDC helps to ensure the comparability and compatibility of data derived from a range of different statistical, administrative and service provision systems at both the state and national level.\n\nThe ASCDC is designed to collect, classify and disseminate data on drugs of concern. Because most drugs have the potential to be considered of concern in certain circumstances or contexts, the scope of the classification is all drugs. However, only those drugs noted by key stakeholders in the health, welfare, and crime and justice sectors to be of current concern in the Australian context of harm minimisation are identified in the main classification structure. This includes all drugs of concern which may be identified using the criteria listed above (see Identifying the Base Level Units of the Classification, above).\n\nIt should also be noted that the main classification structure of the ASCDC does not distinguish between drugs of concern on the basis of their legality. Further, it is not a suitable vehicle for the classification of the different chemical or physical forms in which a drug may be available, and should not be used to determine the different methods of drug use. These are correlative variables for which the 'Form of Drug' and 'Method of Drug Use' classifications have been developed.",

They comprise three separate classifications, covering culture and leisure related industries, products and occupations.\n\nThe classifications of the ACLC focus on the economic side of culture and leisure activities - that is, the way culture and leisure activities are linked to the economy through direct expenditure and employment. The ACLC does this through three classifications: Industry, Product and Occupation. The Industry Classification lists industries consisting of organisations for which the main activity is the production or provision of culture and leisure goods and services, and is based on the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC). The Product Classification consists of a list of culture and leisure goods and services (together known as products). These products are the primary outputs of the industries listed in the Industry Classification; in addition, they may also be produced by other industries (for example, museum services may be provided by a business in the mining industry). The Occupation Classification, which is based on the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO), lists occupations which are predominantly culture or leisure in nature.\n\nThese classifications are adopted by the ABS and organisations outside of the ABS for survey design, organising administrative data and disseminating culture and leisure information.\n\nThis is the second edition of the ACLC, following the first edition developed in 2001. This edition reflects a minor review undertaken to update ACLC concordances to the new editions of standard ABS classifications.

    "description": "UKAT is a subject thesaurus which has been created for the archive sector in the United Kingdom. It is a controlled vocabulary which archives can use when indexing their collections and catalogues. UKAT was created between June 2003 and August 2004 from subject terms contributed by individual archives, archive projects and users of archives. The backbone of UKAT is the UNESCO Thesaurus. However, while UNESCO covers a broad range of subject areas, it often lacks the depth of detailed terminology required by archives for indexing. It was therefore decided that UKAT should extend and adapt UNESCO to incorporate indexing terms which repositories and projects had devised themselves or incorporated from other schemes, such as Library of Congress Subject Headings or the British Education Thesaurus. UKAT has thus been created as a thesaurus conforming to international standards, with the coherent structure of UNESCO, but also significantly enhanced to include terms of relevance to the archive community and its users. Particular emphasis has been given to incorporating terms reflecting the histories and experiences of groups which are under-represented among archive users, to encourage their participation in the archival heritage in line with national priorities for the sector.\n\nThe key aims of UKAT are: to improve access to archives by subject; to ensure that users of archives can carry out effective subject searches of the national archives network; and to promote the involvement in archives by groups which are under-represented among archive users, by providing subject terms which reflect their histories and experiences.",

The English (American) version of the MT is compatible with the AGI (American Geological Institute) GeoRef Thesaurus, the French version with the INIST/BRGM (Institute de l'Information Scientifique et Technique/Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières) PASCAL/GEODE Lexique, and the German with the BGR (Bundesanstalt für Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe) GEOLINE Thesaurus. The other language versions are compatible with national thesauri used in Russia (VSEGEI), Spain (ITGE/GEOMINER), Italy (CNR/GEODOC) and Finland (Geological Survey of Finland/FINGEO). The MT gives the documentary equivalents of major geoscience concepts in the languages included at present. The MT is also an operational tool for the development and management of other national geoscience thesauri in a manner that ensures compatibility with other major geoscience information systems. A most interesting aspect of the MT is the possibility of developing multilingual search facilities, i.e. searches can be performed in any of the languages of the MT, and documents may be retrieved that contain the corresponding term in any of the other languages of the MT. At the Geological Survey of Finland the MT has been already been used to enable such multilingual searches. The Finnish index terms or English index terms used in the databases to describe the content can be linked through the thesaurus function of the TRIP system to the corresponding terms in all languages of the MT making all terms for the same concept synomyms irrespective of the language.",

DeCS is a dynamic vocabulary totaling 30,895 descriptors, of which 26,664 come from MeSH, and 4658 are exclusively DeCS. There is an addition of 2051 hierarchic codes from DeCS categories in 1491 MeSH descriptors. The following are the DeCS categories and their total number of descriptors: Health Surveillance (828); Homeopathy (1,944), Public Health (3,491); and Science and Health (219). The sum is greater than the total number of descriptors, since a descriptor may occur more than once in the hierarchy. By being dynamic, it records a permanent process of change including the development of new areas of terminology. With the creation of the national, institutional and thematic VHLs, search strategies were made available in the various topics in order to facilitate the retrieval of the existing literature. DeCS was created to serve as a unique language in indexing articles from scientific journals, books, congress proceedings, technical reports, and other types of materials, as well as for searching and retrieving subjects from scientific literature from information sources available on the Virtual Health Library (VHL) such as LILACS, MEDLINE, and others.",

    "description": "The main aim in producing this reference work is to try to standardise the terminology in the field of astronomy for the purposes of aiding unambiguous library cataloguing and more precise recall of data from computer databases. The thesaurus is intended for use by astronomy librarians and scientists. Its compilation was originally requested during a meeting of Commission 5 (Documentation) of the International Astronomical Union at the New Delhi General Assembly of the IAU in 1984. Vocabulary control has become essential in the use of online databases, particularly where those responsible for data input and for searching databases are nonspecialists. Consistency, particularly in the input to computerised databases, is imperative if there is to be high precision recall in information retrieval. Conversely, for those accessing databases (the output process), the selection of relevant terms or those most specific to the information request, will result in higher precision recall. The thesaurus is also designed to give the librarian, cataloguer or indexer, as well as the astronomer, a context for astronomical terms with which they may not be familiar. It is envisaged that the thesaurus will be used for the following main purposes: 1. Assigning keyterms to scientific papers; this is usually best done by the authors themselves, rather than by non-specialists. If the thesaurus is to serve as originally intended by Commission 5 of the IAU - to standardise the astronomical terminology -, then authors should use only the upper case terms in the thesaurus in their keyterm lists. 2. Extraction of references from databases, when the use of the same list of terms as is used by the authors can be expected to result in high precision recall of relevant data. 3. Assisting in the updating of library classification schemes. 4. It may be included in 'intelligent' databases, to help the user select alternatives or extensions to a searcher's initial list, as in proximity searching. Other uses suggested to us have been as a source of terms for exclusion as passwords for observatory computers and as a supplementary dictionary of words used by a spelling checker for word processors.",

    "description": "Initial development of the AOD Thesaurus started with collecting terms and term relationships from many sources; search requests received for ETOH and NCADI databases; document titles and index terms; more than 40 special thesauri; and NIAAA's Reports to Congress on Alcohol and Health and other publications. Major sources used for reference and guidance included the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Lexicon of Alcohol and Drug Terms, developed jointly with NIAAA; NLM's Medical Subject HeadingsInternational Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions; the DSM–III and draft DSM–IV; the Thesaurus of Psychological Indexing Terms (PsyclNFO); the Thesaurus of ERIC Descriptors; and the Thesaurus of Sociological Indexing Terms (Sociological Abstracts). The multitude of terms collected from these sources were organized into hierarchies, which revealed many synonyms and near-synonyms. A conceptual analysis process known as semantic factoring further clarified the structure and led to a smaller vocabulary of conceptual building blocks. The resulting structure was thoroughly field-tested through a query formulation and indexing test. Analyzing the results from multiple indexers for important terms missed, different indexers using different terms to express the same idea, terms assigned erroneously, and terms needed but missing from the Thesaurus, the developers identified areas requiring clarification, redundancies between areas, missing cross-references, the need for more or better scope notes, and areas where detail could be reduced. Further refinements were made in the second edition based on indexing and searching experience: Descriptors were added, overly specific descriptors were pruned, the structure was improved, and many scope notes and relationships were added. Thesaurus maintenance for this edition started with identifying key, recent sources in the AOD field, including a wide variety of publications such as NIAAA’s Ninth Report to the U.S. Congress on Alcohol and Health, a number of issues of Alcohol Health & Research World, the Institute of Medicine’s Reducing Risks for Mental Disorders: Frontiers for Preventive Intervention Research, the draft International Classification of Preventive Trials, and of course, the most recent editions of various thesauri: NLM’s Medical Subject Headings, the Thesaurus of Psychological Terms, and the Thesaurus of Sociological Indexing Terms. Terms and term relationships from the preceding publications in addition to many other sources, including the entire Identifier (ID) field from the ETOH database, which is used to assign terms or concepts that are not in the AOD Thesaurus or for terms that are not designated ETOH descriptors. An analysis of the terms in this field helped the thesaurus development team identify missing concepts and thesaurus terms that should be designated ETOH descriptors. NIAAA is committed to the maintenance of the AOD Thesaurus as an ongoing process driven by user feedback. Users are strongly encouraged to comment on any aspect of the thesaurus. The thesaurus presents a structured collection of concepts and terms intended to facilitate indexing and retrieval, support research and program planning through conceptual structure and definitions, and improve communication through standardized terminology. The thesaurus provides guidance to the indexers for request-oriented (or user-centered) indexing. It organizes concepts collected from search requests into an easily grasped hierarchical structure that serves as a framework or checklist in analyzing documents. The logical structure of the Thesaurus communicates user interests to the indexer. Its controlled vocabulary expresses each concept unambiguously through one term, called a descriptor, that is used in indexing and can thus be used with confidence in searching. Synonyms lead to descriptors: polydrug use leads to AA2.6 multiple drug use; chemical abuse, drug abuse, and substance abuse all lead to GC2 AOD abuse; nerve cellneurocyte both lead to and XX2.2 neuron. The thesaurus is also very useful for free-text searching (searching based on words in the title or abstract). An exhaustive free-text search must include all terms that might be used to express the searched-for concept. This requires query term expansion: In synonym expansion, expand the query term XX2.2 neuron by adding the synonyms nerve cell and neurocyte; in hierarchic expansion, add narrower terms, such as XX2.2.2.4 dendrite and XX2.2.2.6 axon (with its synonyms, such as nerve fiber and neurite).",

    "description": "This table provides a classification of HTTP-based APIs. The classification achieves an explicit differentiation between the various kinds of uses of HTTP and provides a foundation to analyse and describe the system properties induced. Providing distinct names for the API 'styles' overcomes the useless situation where APIs are named 'RESTful' and 'not so RESTful','almost RESTful', or 'unRESTful'. An API either adheres to REST's interface constraints or it does not and if it does not, there is no sense in referring to 'REST' in the API's name. Especially so because mentioning REST might cause the false impression that the achieved system would share the same system properties as RESTful systems. They do not - and it is important to understand that the system being designed might not have the expected properties. For example, caching and visibility can be ruined by tunneling operations though action names in URIs.\n\nThe most important distinction to be made today is the one between the two HTTP-based API kinds HTTP-based Type I and HTTP-based Type II on the one hand and REST on the other hand. The former two, while not RESTful due to their violation of the hypermdia constraint, can be a reasonable design choice if the tight coupling they induce is acceptable for the given system. This might be the case if the expected life time of the system does not warrant the considerable work of designing a proper media type. However, it must be explicitly understood that both API kinds, 'HTTP-based Type I' and 'HTTP-based Type II' lead to systems in which clients and servers are coupled by their original design and that the evolvability properties of RESTful systems are in no way induced.",

The Health Canada Controlled Subject Vocabulary ('gchccv') has been registered with Library and Archives Canada for this purpose. The scope of the Controlled Vocabulary is dynamic and reflects subjects that have been addressed at one time or another in Health Canada sources. Terms were selected from the Government of Canada's Core Subject thesaurus and various Health Canada products, including publications, databases and related sources. The following types of concepts have been excluded from the Controlled Vocabulary: geographical names, titles (e.g., of programs), proper names (e.g., of companies) and acronyms, except where they are in common usage. The Controlled Vocabulary is a set of preferred terms that can be used to catalogue documents.

    "description": "The indexing terms listed in the thesaurus are those found in the RCDC Bibliographic Data Base and therefore are the terms used to generate the keyword index in this volume. The keywords are arranged alphabetically. Numbers, dashes, parentheses and super- and sub-scripts are ignored in ordering the terms except when required to distinguish two terms. Thus, '1-propanol' precedes '2-propanol' (following 'propane') and 'H2O+' precedes 'H2O-' and 'H2O2+' (all three precede 'hole'). Arrangement is word by word, thus 'hole traps' precedes 'holes'. The name of any element may be used as a keyword, but the names have been omitted from the listing. In addition, the following terms may be used: 1. 'element name' followed by a one- to three-digit number, specifying a nuclide, e.g. cobalt-60. 2. 'element name' followed by 'ions', e.g. vanadium ions. 3. 'element name' followed by 'compounds', e.g. nickel compounds. 4. 'element name' followed by 'atoms', e.g., oxygen atoms. None of the terms represented by 1 through 4 appear in the thesaurus with the exception of several in group 3 for which narrower terms have neen designated as keywords. Another exception occurs in the indexing of halogen, nitrogen and sulfur compounds; element symbols rather than element names have been used (Br, Cl, F, I, N, S) and the keywords appear as Br compounds, organic and Br compounds, inorganic, etc. Keywords which are the names of specific compounds or classes of compounds are used to define the primary subject of the investigation (or reactant). Products are indexed only by terms such as 'hydrogen formation', 'alkane formation', etc. The addition of -a or -s to a chemical name indicates that the compound was used as an additive or solvent, respectively. Thus, the keyword index may contain 'ethanol-s' as well as 'ethanol'. Each keyword entry contains a listing of broader (BT), narrower (NT) and related (RT) terms, as well as synonyms (see the USE and USED FOR (UF) terms). The narrower terms are always used when applicable, so to find all information on a particular keyword the narrower terms should also be consulted.

The thesaurus is faceted, meaning its top terms delineate general aspects of information resources: Sciences: Major educational fields, fields of study, and professional groupings within USGS. Methods: Techniques, methods, procedures, or strategies for research, management, collection, or analysis of scientific information in USGS Topics: Themes, subjects, and concerns for which USGS information resources are relevant Product types: General representation of the information in a resource, such as a map or data set Time periods: Geologic time periods and seasons of the year USGS: Activities, processes, and organizational concepts relevant to USGS itself The thesaurus is limited in depth and specificity of coverage. It does not attempt to replicate existing controlled vocabularies such as GeoRef. The intention is to provide sufficient contextual cues for the information seeker to determine the relevance of a resource for his or her concern, not to locate precisely the answer to a specific user question. Each information resource in the Science Topics catalog is categorized using several index terms. Consequently a document will be listed under each category for which it would be considered a relevant resource. Approximately 1200 web resources are listed in the catalog.",

These domains are classified from body, individual and societal perspectives by means of two lists: a list of body functions and structure, and a list of domains of activity and participation. Since an individual's functioning and disability occurs in a context, the ICF also includes a list of environmental factors.\n\nThe ICF is WHO's framework for measuring health and disability at both individual and population levels. The ICF was officially endorsed by all 191 WHO Member States in the Fifty-fourth World Health Assembly on 22 May 2001 (resolution WHA 54.21). Unlike its predecessor, which was endorsed for field trail purposes only, the ICF was endorsed for use in Member States as the international standard to describe and measure health and disability.\n\nThe ICF puts the notions of 'health' and 'disability' in a new light. It acknowledges that every human being can experience a decrement in health and thereby experience some degree of disability. Disability is not something that only happens to a minority of humanity. The ICF thus 'mainstreams' the experience of disability and recognises it as a universal human experience. By shifting the focus from cause to impact it places all health conditions on an equal footing allowing them to be compared using a common metric - the ruler of health and disability. Furthermore ICF takes into account the social aspects of disability and does not see disability only as a 'medical' or 'biological' dysfunction. By including Contextual Factors, in which environmental factors are listed ICF allows to records the impact of the environment on the person's functioning.",

West Library. This compilation consists of a controlled vocabulary based on the National Library of Medicine’s Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). OT Search users will find this tool useful in performing compact and efficient search strategies. In comparison to a broad keyword search, a search strategy utilizing valid subject headings will generate the most pertinent references related to a particular topic. It is, therefore, advisable to select appropriate terms from the thesaurus before performing your search in OT SEARCH. This thesaurus comprises two major sections: I. Alphabetical Subject Listing: A listing of all the subject terms in alphabetical order. Each entry consists of a hierarchical tree number, a note and annotation when appropriate, and a definition of the term proper. While approved subject headings are printed in capital letters (e.g. SENSORY INTEGRATIVE DYSFUNCTION), related terms are printed in lower case (e.g. Early intervention programs), with a reference to the approved subject headings (e.g. Tactile Defensiveness, use SENSORY INTEGRATIVE DYSFUNCTION). In some cases, the searcher is directed to related terms by a 'see also' reference (e.g. NURSING HOMES, see also HOMES FOR THE AGED). Some subject headings are inverted for focus purposes (e.g. health insurance is listed in the thesaurus as INSURANCE, HEALTH). II. Hierarchical Classification Scheme: A listing of tree numbers in hierarchical order. Each term is assigned a unique alphanumeric number which places it in an hierarchical classification scheme or 'tree' with a broader, narrower, or related term. The hierarchical classification scheme consists of a number of tables which classify the subject headings into several categorical layers. The major categories cover broader concepts such as anatomy, diseases, chemicals and drugs, procedures and techniques, equipment and supplies, behavior and behavior mechanisms, biological sciences, physical sciences, social sciences, technology, humanities, information sciences, persons, health care and geographic names. These categories are further broken into a strata of categories. Each table consists of an array of tree numbers and matching subject headings which are indented according to their hierarchical structure.

    "description": "The Integrative Levels Classification (ILC) is a knowledge organization system featuring experimental innovations. Although drawing from the heritage of bibliographic classifications, it is different from most of them in allowing to represent any combination of concepts without the ties of traditional disciplines. Phenomena of the world are listed in the ILC schedule according to the natural sequence of integrative levels; each concept can then be freely combined with others by meaningful relationships (facets). This makes ILC suitable to order and connect knowledge in a variety of media, including directories, websites, encyclopedias, audio-visual archives, printed collections, museum specimens, etc. The expressivity of its notation makes it especially fit to be integrated in computer-based automation to produce clever search and dynamic displays of knowledge items. ILC is being developed progressively since 2004. A first stable edition (ILC 1) is available for those interested in testing or using it. This includes 7052 classes (concepts) covering the whole spectrum of knowledge broadly, plus deeper specificity in certain domains (e.g. cetaceans, countries, ...) that have already been worked out in detail. The combination mechanisms allow to use the existing classes to generate meanings that approximate well enough the contents of most general collections. A special feature (deictics) is also available to define extensions fitting your local needs in ways compatible with the general system. The ILC research project takes its theoretical and technical foundations from the work developed in the 1960s by the Classification Research Group (CRG) in London, particularly in the persons of Douglas J. Foskett and Derek Austin, under a NATO grant. At the time this did not produce a finished system for contingent reasons, but it did leave us with a precious heritage of advanced techniques (freely faceted classification) that are now being implemented in ILC. The system is currently developed and managed by an international team led by Claudio Gnoli and including researchers, librarians, computer scientists, and philosophers.",

    "description": "ACM's first classification system for the computing field was published in 1964. Then, in 1982, the ACM published an entirely new system. New versions based on the 1982 system followed, in 1983, 1987, 1991, and 1998. The 2012 scheme utilizes a new poly-hierarchical structure and a more in-depth approach than the 1998 version. It no longer uses the letter-and-number coding of the previous versions. The old scheme has been mapped to the new, and both the 1998 and 2012 terms are available on Citation Pages of all indexed articles in the ACM Digital Library. The 2012 ACM Computing Classification System has been developed as a poly-hierarchical ontology that can be utilized in semantic web applications. It replaces the traditional 1998 version of the ACM Computing Classification System (CCS), which has served as the de facto standard classification system for the computing field. It is being integrated into the search capabilities and visual topic displays of the ACM Digital Library. It relies on a semantic vocabulary as the single source of categories and concepts that reflect the state of the art of the computing discipline and is receptive to structural change as it evolves in the future. ACM will a provide tools to facilitate the application of 2012 CCS categories to forthcoming papers and a process to ensure that the CCS stays current and relevant. The new classification system will play a key role in the development of a people search interface in the ACM Digital Library to supplement its current traditional bibliographic search.",

    "description": "The South American Classification Committee is an official committee of the American Ornithologists' Union whose mission is to create a standard classification, with English names, for the bird species of South America. This classification is subject to constant revision by the proposal system to allow incorporation of new data. The SACC hopes to have this classification published as a printed document within a year or so. The starting point for the classification was a pre-publication draft of Dickinson (2003); the published version differed in a few minor ways from the version used for the starting point (as noted in the Notes sections below). The classification herein consists mainly of the ranks Order, Family, Genus, and Species. Most traditional subfamilies are omitted unless supported by multiple independent data sets that mark major, deep branches within a family. Subspecies are omitted for now; a future edition will also include the Subspecies rank as designating diagnosable populations (equivalent to phylogenetic species sensu Cracraft) within taxa accorded species rank, as well as synopses of distribution. We recognize the importance of this level of classification for many kinds of analyses but are unable to provide a comprehensive evaluation of which currently recognized subspecies represent valid taxonomic units in terms of diagnosability. See Dickinson (2003) for a preliminary assessment of valid subspecies of South American birds, as well as various volumes of the Handbook of the Birds of World (Lynx Edicions, Barcelona). The region covered by the list is: (1) continental South America and all islands within 1200 km of its shores eastward into the Atlantic and westward into the Pacific oceans (including Malpelo, the Galapagos islands, San Felix and San Ambrosio, the Juan Fernandez islands, Fernando de Noronha, Trindade, Martin Vaz, São Pedro and São Paulo Archipelago, and the Falklands/Malvinas); (2) islands in the Caribbean Sea close to South America and not covered by the AOU Checklist (including Netherlands Antilles, Trinidad and Tobago); and (3) waters within 200 nautical miles of the coasts of these land areas, including the islands. A species is included on the list if the evidence for its occurrence in the area is supported by tangible evidence that is available for verification, namely a museum specimen or an archived or published photograph, videotape, or sound recording. The main list currently includes 3,330 species (3094 native breeding species, 1 of which is extinct; 147 nonbreeding residents; 75 vagrants; 14 established, introduced species). Of these, 103 newly discovered species have been described since the publication of Meyer de Schauensee's (1970) classic compilation of the species of birds of South America (i.e., at a rate of 2.5 species per year). Species whose presence is supported only by sight records, or by unpublished or non-archived tangible evidence, are placed on the Hypothetical List.",

    "description": "The TC-DB website details a comprehensive classification system for membrane transport proteins known as the Transport Classification (TC) system. The TC system is analogous to the Enzyme Commission (EC) system for classification of enzymes, except that it incorporates both functional and phylogenetic information. Descriptions, TC numbers, and examples of over 600 families of transport proteins are provided. Transport systems are classified on the basis of five criteria, and each of these criteria corresponds to one of the five numbers or letters within the TC# for a particular type of transporter. Thus a TC# normally has five components as follows: V.W.X.Y.Z. V (a number) corresponds to the transporter class (i.e., channel, carrier (porter), primary active transporter or group translocator); W (a lettter) corresponds to the transporter subclass which in the case of primary active transporters refers to the energy source used to drive transport; X (a number) corresponds to the transporter family (sometimes actually a superfamily); Y (a number) corresponds to the subfamily in which a transporter is found, and Z corresponds to the substrate or range of substrates transported. Any two transport systems in the same subfamily of a transporter family that transport the same substrate(s) are given the same TC#, regardless of whether they are orthologues (e.g., arose in distinct organisms by speciation) or paralogues (e.g., arose within a single organism by gene duplication). Sequenced homologues of unknown function are not normally assigned a TC# unless they represent a unique (sub)family or are from an unrepresented organismal kingdom. If multiple dissimilar subunits are present, they are numbered S1, S2, S3...Sn. Classification categories 8 and 9 are reserved for accessory transport proteins and incompletely characterized (families of) transporters, respectively. Mechanisms of bulk transport via endocytosis, exocytosis and intracellular trafficking, observed in eukaryotes and prokaryotes (Lonhienne et al., 2010) are not included in TCDB.",

    "description": "The Library of Congress Classification (LCC) is a classification system that was first developed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to organize and arrange the book collections of the Library of Congress. Over the course of the twentieth century, the system was adopted for use by other libraries as well, especially large academic libraries in the United States. It is currently one of the most widely used library classification systems in the world. The Library's Cataloging Policy and Support Office maintains and develops the system, posting weekly lists of updates on its Web site. The system divides all knowledge into twenty-one basic classes, each identified by a single letter of the alphabet. Most of these alphabetical classes are further divided into more specific subclasses, identified by two-letter, or occasionally three-letter, combinations. For example, class N, Art, has subclasses NA, Architecture; NB, Sculpture, ND, Painting; as well as several other subclasses. Each subclass includes a loosely hierarchical arrangement of the topics pertinent to the subclass, going from the general to the more specific. Individual topics are often broken down by specific places, time periods, or bibliographic forms (such as periodicals, biographies, etc.). Each topic (often referred to as a caption) is assigned a single number or a span of numbers. Whole numbers used in LCC may range from one to four digits in length, and may be further extended by the use of decimal numbers. Some subtopics appear in alphabetical, rather than hierarchical, lists and are represented by decimal numbers that combine a letter of the alphabet with a numeral , e.g. .B72 or .K535. Relationships among topics in LCC are shown not by the numbers that are assigned to them, but by indenting subtopics under the larger topics that they are a part of, much like an outline. In this respect, it is different from more strictly hierarchical classification systems, such as the Dewey Decimal Classification, where hierarchical relationships among topics are shown by numbers that can be continuously subdivided.",

English Heritage takes a leading role in setting standards for recording the built and buried heritage. By setting standards that can be adopted by everyone, we can make sure that all records are consistent. In other words, if everyone uses the same words to describe the same monument, archaeological object, building material, etc, then anyone using this common language can easily index, retrieve and understand these records. With this aim in mind, English Heritage is continually developing new thesauri to provide structure and guidelines for the standardisation of terms to be used when creating new records of the past. Now, in our drive to disseminate these standards and promote their wider use, we are making available seven separate online thesauri. A tailor-made suite of programs has been developed, which uses a database to create a series of web pages for any chosen thesaurus. These can be easily accessed using a frames-capable browser and regularly updated as new terms are submitted and approved by our Data Standards Unit.\n\nNational cultural heritage thesauri and vocabularies have acted as standards for use by both national organizations and local authority Historic Environment Records but until now have lacked the persistent Linked Open Data (LOD) URIs that would allow them to act as vocabulary hubs for the Web of Data. The AHRC funded SENESCHAL project aims to make such vocabularies available online as Semantic Web resources. SENESCHAL will start with major vocabularies as exemplars and project partners will continue to make other vocabularies available. Other organizations are welcome to make use of the data and services which will be open licensed.\n\nRESTful web services will be developed for the project to make the vocabulary resources programmatically accessible and searchable.

Since then, it has been extensively revised and developed, and has become a highly flexible and effective system for organizing bibliographic records for all kinds of information in any medium (it is well suited to multi-media information collections). It is structured in such a way that new developments and new fields of knowledge can be readily incorporated. The code itself is independent of any particular language or script (consisting of arabic numerals and common punctuation marks), and the accompanying class descriptions have appeared in many translated versions. UDC is in worldwide use, and has been published in whole or in part in 40 different languages. The Multilingual Universal Decimal Classification Summary - UDC Summary (udcS) for short - represents a selection of around 2,600 classes extracted from the UDC Master Reference File (UDC MRF) 2011 which contains over 70,000 classes. The selection comprises main numbers, common auxiliary numbers and special auxiliary numbers and it represents even coverage of all areas of knowledge as contained by the scheme. UDC is updated annually and UDC Summary represents always the latest version of UDC. The UDC Summary is held in a multilingual database that mirrors the structure of the UDC MRF database and in that respect represents the full set of data and can be used as a UDC demonstrator for training, research, various information organization and retrieval purposes.",

In certain cases they are clustered in thematic areas. The terms of these lists were selected according to their pertinence and relevance.\n\nAt present we are working on a database of around 3.700 terms. The thematic areas, covered at present, deal with snow and ice physics, snow and ice morphology, snow and ice radiometry, remote sensing and GIS in cryosphere environment, sea ice, avalanches and glaciers. Concerning the vertical structure we adopted the Classification Scheme already in use for the development of the EARTh Thesaurus. The hierarchical setup is based on facets; according to its intrinsic features, the structure can be used as a semantic reference system, stable and partially independent from the context.\n\nSince the facet structure tends to scatter the terms under the more general referral category, we are implementing a thematic structure that will cluster the terms in themes representing specific sectors. The possibility of applying different thematic schemes allows the exploration of concepts according to different perspectives, which is able to emphasize particular and contingent aspects.",

    "description": "The project aims at developing a controlled and structured terminology system related to GIS and remote sensing. The first phase corresponds to the identification of potential sources of terminology, the selection of proper terms, their extraction and the creation of a terminology database. Terms have been classified according to the EARTh upper structure. The semantic classification foresees the allocation of each term in a relation tree starting from the more general concept represented by the category. The result is a terminology system containing about 3.500 terms. The system can be considered as a prototype of domain semantic map, open to future integrations and updating. The use of the system by a user community would allow a better management of information and ease the information and data sharing, due both to the use of a common language and to the better semantic comprehension of data.",

    "description": "The MK Spectral classification system was founded by W. W. Morgan and P. C. Keenan in the year 1943, with the publication of the first photographic spectral classification atlas, 'An Atlas of Stellar Spectra' (Morgan, Keenan & Kellman 1943). Since that time, the MK system has been extensively revised and refined by Morgan, Keenan and others. In the late 1970's, two important spectral atlases, summarizing the development of the MK system up until that time, were published. These atlases, the Revised MK Spectral Atlas for Stars Earlier than the Sun by Morgan, Abt & Tapscott (1978) and An Atlas of Spectra of the Cooler Stars: Types G, K, M, S and C, by Keenan & McNeil (1976), are the inspiration for this new digital spectral classification atlas. Indeed, some of the pages in this atlas are 'digitized' versions of pages from those two atlases. The MK spectral classification system is a natural, empirical system of spectral classification which uses in the classification process only the directly observable features in the spectrum. The MK system is defined by a set of standard stars, and classification on the system is carried out by the comparison of the program star with the standard stars, taking into account all of the features in the spectrum. The use of standards is vital because it maintains the autonomy of the system as well as ensuring that different observers will classify stars on the same system. When the MK system was first defined, it was based on photographic spectra in the blue-violet part of the spectrum. This was done by necessity, as photographic emulsions in the 1940's were sensitive only to blue-violet light. However, it was a fortunate choice, as the blue-violet portion of the spectrum (essentially from the Ca II K-line to Hbeta) contains a high density of astrophysically important atomic lines and molecular bands, which allow accurate classification of the star in a two-dimensional temperature, luminosity grid. Classification systems can and have been set up in the red, IR and the ultraviolet. These should remain independent of the traditional MK system, as different parts of the spectrum can sample different levels in the atmosphere of the star. The current spectral atlas should be considered an ongoing work which will likely be completed only in a number of years. The spectra in this atlas have been obtained with the Gray/Miller spectrograph on the 0.8 meter telescope of the Dark Sky Observatory, using a CCD detector. Two spectral resolutions have been used in this atlas. Most of the illustrations use spectra obtained with the 1200g/mm grating, which gives a spectral resolution of 1.8 Å/2 pixels and a spectral range of 3800 Å - 4600 Å, but some illustrations, especially those of the later-type stars (K, M, C and S) use spectra obtained with the 600g/mm grating. These have a resolution of 3.6 Å/2 pixels, and a spectral range of 3800 Å - 5600 Å. The higher resolution spectra are presented in a rectified intensity versus wavelength format, in which the spectral continuum has been normalized to unity. The 3.6 Å resolution spectra, for the most part, are presented in a flux versus wavelength format; this format provides additional information on the energy distribution of the star, and is to be preferred for the cooler stars, as these stars have essentially no continuum points in their spectra. For ease of illustration, the fluxes have been normalized to unity at one consistent point in the spectrum. Since the publication of the two most recent photographic spectral atlases mentioned in the paragraphs above, the MK system has undergone extensive revision and refinement. Important work in refining and extending the MK system to dimensions beyond the traditional two-dimensional temperature/luminosity grid has been carried out by Keenan and co-workers in the addition of abundance indices for the late-type stars, by Gray (1989), in the extension of the MK system to metal-weak F and G-type stars, by Henry, Kirkpatrick & coworkers in their careful redefinition and extension of the MK system to the M-type dwarfs and most lately the \"L-type\" stars, and by Walborn in the classification of the O-type stars. Later editions of this atlas will attempt to illustrate more fully these developments.",

    "description": "The Atlas of Stellar Spectra and the accompanying outline have been prepared from the viewpoint of the practical stellar astronomer. Problems connected with the astrophysical interpretation of the spectral sequence are not touched on; as a consequence, emphasis is placed on ``ordinary'' stars. These are the stars most important statistically and the only ones suitable for large-scale investigations of galactic structure. The plan of the Atlas can be stated as follows: a) To set up a classification system as precise as possible which can be extended to stars of the eighth to twelfth magnitude with good systematic accuracy. The system should be as closely correlated with color temperature (or color equivalent) as is possible. The criteria used for classification should be those which change most smoothly with color equivalent. b) Such a system as described under (a) requires a classification according to stellar luminosity, that is, the system should be two-dimensional. We thus introduce a vertical spectral type, or luminosity class; then, for a normal star, the spectrum is uniquely located when a spectral type and a luminosity class are determined. The actual process of classification is carried out in the following manner: (1) an approximate spectral type is determined; (2) the luminosity class is determined; (3) by comparison with stars of similar luminosity an accurate spectral type is found.",

    "description": "The National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) system is used by the IRS and NCCS to classify nonprofit organizations. It is also used by the Foundation Center to classify both grants and grant recipients (typically nonprofits or governments). NCCS and the IRS use the NTEE-CC system, described below, while the Foundation Center uses a slightly different version with more codes, as well as 'population/beneficiary' codes to indicate the type of population served and 'auspice' codes to indicate religious or governmental affiliation. The original NTEE was developed by NCCS during the 1980s with the collaboration of major nonprofit organizations. According to Russy D. Sumariwalla, one of the principal developers of the system, the use of such a system: facilitates the collection, tabulation, presentation, and analysis of data by the types of organizations and their activities; promotes uniformity and comparability in the presentation of statistical and other data collected by various public and private agencies; provides better quality information as the basis for public policy debate and decision-making for the nonprofit sector and for society at large. In the mid-1990s, the IRS decided to begin classifying new organizations using the NTEE system. The 'IRS determination specialists' - the individuals who decide whether or not an organization is eligible to receive federal tax exempt status - would classify the organizations based on descriptive data in the organizations' applications for recognition of tax-exempt status (Forms 1023 and 1024). Before beginning, they requested a simplified version of the NTEE to ease classification and to provide a better fit into the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), the new federal government economic classification system that replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes in 1999. The National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities-Core Codes (NTEE-CC) was created to meet this need. Designed by a team of experts, the NTEE-CC includes approximately two-thirds, or about 400, of the 645 categories in the original NTEE. Though the majority of the differences in the NTEE-CC are a result of collapsing lesser-used codes, improvements were also included. With its ease of use and consistent hierarchical logic, the NTEE-CC serves as the best instrument for tax-exempt status determination, NAICS linkage, and nonprofit organizational classification. Unlike the system used the Foundation Center, the NTEE-CC system eliminated the so-called Common Codes that permitted the 4th character of the NTEE to indicate if an organization primarily serve any of a dozen or so functions other than direct service. These categories include: alliances, advocacy, management and technical assistance, research, policy analysis, fundraising and other types of support for other nonprofit organizations. At the same time, the NTEE-CC system added 3-character categories - all in the 01-19 range within each major group (e.g., A01, B01, A19, B19, etc.) - for organizations that fulfilled these specialized functions.",

The goal was not to create yet another standard, but to work towards creating a more broadly adopted standard that more accurately reflects the work of the field and can serve as a more relevant tool for a 21st Century global philanthropy community.\n\nThe Center consulted partner organizations, received feedback from the sector to complete the final revisions, and released the first version of the PCS in December 2014. The Center will be recoding our entire database over the next 4 months and the PCS will be reflected in our online products during the second quarter of 2015. Until that time we will continue to publish data using our prior Grants Classification System.\n\nThe Philanthropy Classification System (PCS) describes the work of grantmakers, recipient organizations and the philanthropic transactions between those entities. The Center’s Classification System in based on the National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) and has been expanded over the last three decades to include the emerging work we have evidenced while capturing and indexing the work of the sector on a global scale.\n\nThe facets of the PCS illuminate the work and answer the following questions about philanthropy:\n\n    Who? = Population Served\n\n    What? = Subject and Organization Type\n\n    How? = Support Strategy and Transaction Type\n\n    Where? = Geographic Area Served (geotree.foundationcenter.org)\n\nOur newly designed site lets you explore each facet of the taxonomy through the Visual Navigation tool, Quick Search, A-Z search or a hierarchy view.",

The scheme is a system of classification intended to be used for the shelf arrangement of all library materials, regardless of format. Designed as a broad classification, it is suitable for both large and small library collections and may be adapted to handle specialized collections of any size. The NLM Classification is a system of mixed notation patterned after the Library of Congress (LC) Classification where alphabetical letters which denote broad subject categories are further subdivided by numbers. The NLM Classification utilizes schedules QS-QZ and W-WZ, permanently excluded from the LC Classification Schedules and is intended to be used with the LC schedules which supplement the NLM Classification for subjects bordering on medicine and for general reference materials. The LC schedules for Human Anatomy (QM), Microbiology (QR), and Medicine (R) are not used at all by the National Library of Medicine since they overlap the NLM Classification. The headings for the individual schedules are given in brief form (e.g., WE - Musculoskeletal System; WG - Cardiovascular System) and together they provide an outline of the subjects that constitute the NLM Classification. These headings are interpreted broadly and include the physiological system, the specialty or specialties connected with them, the regions of the body chiefly concerned and subordinate related fields. The Classification is hierarchical, and within each schedule, division by organ usually has priority. Each main schedule, as well as some sections within a schedule, begins with a group of form numbers ranging generally from 1-49 which are used to classify materials by publication type, e.g., dictionaries, atlases, laboratory manuals, etc. The main schedules QS-QZ, W-WY, and WZ (excluding WZ 220-270) are used to classify works published after 1913; the 19th century schedule is used for works published 1801-1913; and WZ 220-270 is used to provide century groupings for works published before 1801 and Americana.

Starting in 1970, the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education developed a classification of colleges and universities to support its program of research and policy analysis. Derived from empirical data on colleges and universities, the Carnegie Classification was originally published in 1973, and subsequently updated in 1976, 1987, 1994, 2000, 2005, and 2010 to reflect changes among colleges and universities. This framework has been widely used in the study of higher education, both as a way to represent and control for institutional differences, and also in the design of research studies to ensure adequate representation of sampled institutions, students, or faculty. To ensure continuity of the classification framework and to allow comparison across years, the 2010 Classification update retains the same structure of six parallel classifications, initially adopted in 2005. They are as follows: Basic Classification (the traditional Carnegie Classification Framework), Undergraduate and Graduate Instructional Program classifications, Enrollment Profile and Undergraduate Profile classifications, and Size & Setting classification. These classifications provide different lenses through which to view U.S. colleges and universities, offering researchers greater analytic flexibility. These classifications were updated using the most recent national data available as of 2010, and collectively they depict the most current landscape of U.S. colleges and universities.",

Most NTDs diseases are chronic diseases which are related to poverty as a promoter of parasitic, bacterial, and also viral or fungal infections. Although of major healthcare impact in developing and threshold countries NTDs are still seen as a rare event in developed countries.\n\nIn the main target countries of Latin America, Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, the distribution of NTD is controlled by climatic conditions like Temperature (15° C and 40° C), humidity and altitude (below 2200 meters). In these regions, most of the population (around 2.7 billion people) lives on the basis of about $ 2.00 per day. This population is considered the poorest in the world, and is also listed as most vulnerable to NTDs.\n\nAmong the NTDs, the vector-borne diseases (Dengue fever, Leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, American Trypanosomiasis, African Trypanosomiasis, Lymphatic Filariasis, Yellow Fever, among others) have resulted in a high level of mortality in poorer regions. These infections persist for a long time and can cause severe disability and disfigurement, resulting in fundamental economic, social and political burden. Some of these diseases affect developed countries as well.\n\nEnvisioning the maintenance of health quality through health policy efforts, ontologies could play an important role in the management of information processed by health systems. If data in Clinical Information Systems and health databases would be standardized via ontologies data mining and even secondary data usage would be easier. Ontologically accessed data is integratively queryable and hence easy to compare. In particular such formalized data, if grouped, could produce new epidemiological information, to help in decision-making process. As keys challenges for infectious disease management the World Health Organization indicated an urgent need for diagnostic tools, new more effective medicines and pesticides, and the promotion of integrated vector management.\n\nA prerequisite in the fight against vector-borne diseases it has recently been recognized that efforts are needed to facilitate the access to epidemiological knowledge about these diseases in a structured way. Controlled terminologies supported by ontologies help the user to systematically use this knowledge and permit large scale automated analysis approaches like logical and rule-based machine reasoning. At this level our effort concentrates on the most important point for vector-borne disease control is the transmission path, as it drives prevention strategies and decision support. It is also important to have an integration with tools to improve health policy related outcomes.",

    "description": "The domain of data mining (DM) deals with analyzing different types of data. The data typically used in data mining is in the format of a single table, with primitive datatypes as attributes. However, structured (complex) data, such as graphs, sequences, networks, text, image, multimedia and relational data, are receiving an increasing amount of interest in data mining. A major challenge is to treat and represent the mining of different types of structured data in a uniform fashion.\n\nA theoretical framework that unifies different data mining tasks, on different types of data can help to formalize the knowledge about the domain and provide a base for future research, unification and standardization. Next, automation and overall support of the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process is also an important challenge in the domain of data mining. A formalization of the domain of data mining is a solution that addresses these challenges. It can directly support the development of a general framework for data mining, support the representation of the process of mining structured data, and allow the representation of the complete process of knowledge discovery.\n\nWe propose a reference modular ontology for the domain of data mining OntoDM, directly motivated by the need for formalization of the data mining domain. The OntoDM ontology is designed and implemented by following ontology best practices and design principles. Its distinguishing feature is that it uses Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as an upper-level ontology and a template, a set of formally defined relations from Relational Ontology (RO) and other state-of-the-art ontologies, and reuses classes and relations from the Ontology of Biomedical Investigations (OBI), the Information Artifact Ontology (IAO), and the Software Ontology (SWO).

In the context of this multi-disciplinary research environment, to assist the integration and computational processing of results in the affective sciences, we are developing the Emotion Ontology to aid in disambiguation and standardised reporting of research results.\n\nThe ontology will represent all relevant aspects of affective phenomena including their bearers, the different types of emotions, moods, etc., their different parts and dimensions of variation, their facial and vocal expressions, and the role of emotions and affective phenomena in general in influencing human behavior.\n\nProper delineation of the upper levels is essential to ensure the unambiguous interpretation of the entities in the ontology which contributes to the usability and interoperability of the fully populated ontology. To achieve this, we will draw on the Basic Formal Ontology, the domain-independent upper ontology advocated by the OBO Foundry. Subsequent phases of the project will identify, define and place all relevant affective phenomena within the ontology, and link this ontology to neighbouring efforts in the domains of neural and social informatics, such as the Neuroscience Information Framework.

These logical restrictions are necessary due to the chemical nature of glycans, which have complex, branched structures that cannot be represented in any simple way. Glycans are thus distinguished from DNA (e.g., genes) and proteins, which can be represented (at least in their most basic forms) as simple character strings. The structural knowledge in GlycO is modularized, in that larger structures are semantically composed from smaller canonical building blocks. In particular, glycan instances are modeled by linking together several instances of canonical monosaccharide residues, which embody knowledge of their chemical structure (e.g., β-D-GlcpNAc) and context (e.g., attached directly to the Asn residue of a protein). This bottom-up semantic modeling of large molecular structures using smaller building blocks allows structures in GlycO to be placed in a biochemical context by describing the specific interactions of its component parts with proteins, enzymes and other biochemical entities.",

    "description": "The (Computer-Based Patient Record) CPR ontology burrows its name from the Institute of Medicine term used to define medical records systems of the future and the important features that distinguish them for EHRs of today. In particular, it defines a set of requirements including a Record Content category, which states: Uniform core data elements, standardized coding systems and formats, a common data dictionary, and information on outcomes of care and functional status.\n\nThe requirement of a set of uniform core elements is meant to be directly addressed by this ontology. In addition, it attempts to define a minimal set of terms that provide grounded, ontologically commitment for the representations shared between many of the healthcare information (such as HL7 RIM), process and terminological models via the use of foundational ontologies.\n\nIn addition, a major influencing principle is that as far as the application of ontology for the benefit of medical informatics is concerned, a pragmatic approach is necessary - one that compromises between a purely 'realist' approach and a cognitive approach that refrains from committing to a representation of the intrinsic nature of the world. For those aspects of reality for which there is significant consensus on the underlying science and use of terminology, an ontology should try as much as possible to capture the constraints that reflect this consensus. However, where such constraints do not provide any direct benefit in the use ontology in a CPR, we should refrain from any further formalization. The general motivation is to allow ontologies to facilitate the use of computer reasoning in playing an important role in the scientific method, but at the same time protect against an excessive attempt to reduce every aspect of clinical medicine to metaphysical distinctions that do not have any legitimate benefit.",

    "description": "The use of alternate and even competitive terminologies can often impede scientific discoveries. While the experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience literature may refer to certain behavioral paradigms by name (eg. the Stroop paradigm or the Sternberg paradigm) or by function (a working memory task, a visual attention task), these paradigms can vary tremendously in the stimuli that are presented to the subject, the response expected from the subject, and the instructions given to the subject. This means that an automated reasoning system using names of paradigms would not realize that data from these different experiments could be compared and used.\n\nCogPO was developed directly from the taxonomy created for the BrainMap Database. Its design concentrates on what can be observed directly: categorization of each paradigm in terms of (1) the stimulus presented to the subjects, (2) the requested instructions, and (3) the returned response. All paradigms are essentially composed of these three orthogonal components, and formalizing an ontology around them is a clear and direct approach to describing paradigms.  CogPO seeks to represent stimuli, responses, and instructions that define the conditions of the experiment in a standardized format, with well-defined terms and relationships between them. CogPO is being built to be compliant with OBO Foundry principles, and uses the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as its upper level ontology.",

An important issue in the development of MAO is the interoperability with existing information sources, in order to maximise its’ applicability and utility. Therefore, links should be provided to other kinds of information, including databases such as UniProt, PDB or InterPro, as well as existing ontologies such as GO or the HUPO Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI).\n\nA vocabulary of terms is provided in the form of a hierarchical network of concepts, together with precise, explanatory definitions of each term and the inter-relations between the different concepts. The aim is to include the great majority of the concepts relevant to multiple sequence alignments, ranging from fundamental concepts such as ‘sequence’ or ‘residue’ to more complex concepts such as structural environment, functional activity or evolutionary context.\n\nThe MAO is represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), in which each node stands for a concept and the links connecting the nodes represent the relationship between them. Two hierarchical relations are defined: ‘is_a’ and ‘part_of’. The nodes can also have other information attached to them in the form of names (defined by the relation ‘is_name’), annotations (defined by ‘is_annotation’) or other attributes.

    "description": "The goal of the COSMO working group was to develop a foundation ontology by a collaborative process that will allow it to represent all of the basic (‘primitive’) ontology elements that all members felt were needed for their applications.  Interoperability could then be achieved among ontology-based applications using the foundation ontology by creating any specialized domain ontology element as a combination of the primitive ontology elements, and when one system wishes to communicate information to others, it must transmit not only the data, but also any logical specifications of the ontology elements required to interpret the data (if they are not already in the foundation ontology or some public extension).  Any system that can properly interpret the primitive elements will be able to properly interpret ontology elements created as a combination of those primitives.\n\nThe development of COSMO is fully open, and any comments or suggestions from any sources are welcome.  After some discussion and input from members in 2006, the development of the COSMO has been continued primarily by Patrick Cassidy, the chairman of the COSMO Working Group (no longer active).   Contributions and suggestions from any interested party are still welcome and encouraged.   Many of the types (OWL classes) in the current COSMO have been taken from the OpenCyc OWL version 0.78, and from the SUMO.  Other elements were taken from other ontologies (such as BFO and DOLCE) or developed specifically for COSMO.\n\nThe development of the COSMO started as a merger of basic elements from Cyc, SUMO, and DOLCE, and  continued up to revision 589 (2008-02-19), at which point the names (labels) of the elements of the COSMO were compared with the words in the Longman defining vocabulary, and out of the 2201 Longman words, it was discovered that 1817 were not present as labels for COSMO elements.  At this point, a systematic supplementation of the COSMO was begun, to assure that the concepts represented by the Longman vocabulary were all represented in some form in the COSMO.  The new elements are being added by alphabetical inspection of the list of missing Longman words.\n\nAt version 0.65 (April 2010) the COSMO had 7339 types (OWL classes), 808 relations, and 2039 restrictions, and all of the words in the Longman defining vocabulary had some correlated ontology element in the COSMO.  The formal mapping of the Longman words to the ontology elements is at present (rev945) only partly complete, and is continuing.  The mapping consists of a relation “xxxx” on the ontology element to the Longman word(s) that represent that element in English.",

The naming of enzymes by individual workers had proved far from satisfactory in practice. In many cases the same enzymes became known by several different names, while conversely the same name was sometimes given to different enzymes. Many of the names conveyed little or no idea of the nature of the reactions catalysed, and similar names were sometimes given to enzymes of quite different types. To meet this situation, various attempts to bring order into the general nomenclature of enzymes, or into that of particular groups of enzymes, were made by individuals or small groups of specialists, but none of the resulting nomenclatures met with general approval. (...) The Enzyme List in the sixth edition (1992) contains 3540 entries, of which 178 record enzymes which are now transferred elsewhere in the list, and 166 have been deleted completely. Thus the number of enzymes actually listed is 3196, an increase of 29% on the 1984 edition.",

Proteins have been classified according to: Family and subfamily: families are groups of evolutionarily related proteins; subfamilies are related proteins that also have the same function. Molecular function: the function of the protein by itself or with directly interacting proteins at a biochemical level, e.g. a protein kinase. Biological process: the function of the protein in the context of a larger network of proteins that interact to accomplish a process at the level of the cell or organism, e.g. mitosis. Pathway: similar to biological process, but a pathway also explicitly specifies the relationships between the interacting molecules. (...) Version 8.1 (release date June 1, 2013) contains 7729 protein families, divided into 68,992 functionally distinct protein subfamilies.",

The EUROVOC has been 'helvetized', meaning that expressions required in Switzerland have been supplemented, ambiguous or incomprehensible names have been deleted, and in some cases the hierarchical structure changed. Polyhierarchies (more than a generic term for the same sub-term) have been omitted altogether in the interests of clearer use. However, most of the EUROVOC descriptors were adopted, mainly based on version 2, supplemented by version 2.1 and the French version 3 draft. We did not adopt the distinction between domains, microthesauri and descriptors; all descriptors in Helvetosaurus are equivalent keywords that are embedded in a hierarchy. Helvetization was in German; the French version has been deferred for cost-benefit considerations, in agreement with the French-speaking staff of the documentation center.\n\nAs sources for the Helvetization we mainly used documents of the parliamentary services and the federal administration, such as provisional list of keywords, registers and dossier divisions. In order to check how many times a word had been used, we were able to use databases of the parliamentary services, which are e.g. the parliamentary initiatives since 1983 contained in the full text.\"\n\n  The thesaurus is no longer forwarded.",

Collective needs, converting an amalgam of personal needs into a common desire to make the world. The process of realizing the thesaurus has been Complex and enriching, sometimes harsh, in the sense that it has meant, at least for some of the women we have participated in, a rethinking of our being in history and in the world in political relation with other women, and not just as historians . The work, which originally emerged as a group work, became a work of relationship, through the discussion of individual knowledge and proposals with the rest of the team. We started the thesaurus by creating semantic fields and concepts from criticism to androcentric history, especially from the study of gender relations, in which the past and present social subordination of women is revealed and denounced, and a critical reconstruction is made Of social relations between the sexes, as defined by the patriarchal symbolic order. In this way, we defined a large section of our thesaurus that we call 'patriarchal order'. We did it relatively quickly, since we all knew too well 'the master's house', but arguing a lot, given the diversity of our analyzes and our experiences. 1420 terms.\n\nIt arose from the need that the specialists in women's history felt - and felt - to be able to count on the basic instruments of work to develop more rigorously our research, and to guide the historians and historians interested in the subject.",

    "description": "The aim of a World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) is to provide an authoritative and comprehensive list of names of marine organisms, including information on synonymy. While highest priority goes to valid names, other names in use are included so that this register can serve as a guide to interpret taxonomic literature. The content of WoRMS is controlled by taxonomic experts, not by database managers. WoRMS has an editorial management system where each taxonomic group is represented by an expert who has the authority over the content, and is responsible for controlling the quality of the information. Each of these main taxonomic editors can invite several specialists of smaller groups within their area of responsibility to join them. This register of marine species grew out of the European Register of Marine Species (ERMS), and its combination with several other species registers maintained at the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ). Rather than building separate registers for all projects, and to make sure taxonomy used in these different projects is consistent, VLIZ developed a consolidated database called ‘Aphia’. A list of marine species registers included in Aphia is available below. MarineSpecies.org is the web interface for this database. The WoRMS is an idea that is being developed, and will combine information from Aphia with other authoritative marine species lists which are maintained by others (e.g. AlgaeBase, FishBase, Hexacorallia, NeMys). Resources to build MarineSpecies.org and Aphia were provided mainly by the EU Network of Excellence ‘Marine Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning’ (MarBEF), and also by the EU funded Species 2000 Europe and ERMS projects. Intellectual property rights of the European part of the register is managed through the Society for the Management of Electronic Biodiversity Data (SMEBD). Similar solutions are now being investigated for the other parts of the register. Aphia contains valid species names, synonyms and vernacular names, and extra information such as literature and biogeographic data. Besides species names, Aphia also contains the higher classification in which each scientific name is linked to its parent taxon. The classification used is a ‘compromise’ between established systems and recent changes. Its aim is to aid data management, rather than suggest any taxonomic or phylogenetic opinion on species relationships. Keeping WoRMS up-to-date is a continuous process. New information is entered daily by the taxonomic editors and by the members of our data management team. Often data also come in from contributions of large datasets, such as global or regional species lists. No database of this size is without errors and omissions. We can’t promise to make no errors, but we do promise to follow up and give feedback on any communications pointing out errors. Feedback is very welcome!",

CiTO contains the object property cito:cites and its sub-properties, and its inverse property cito:isCitedBy, from the original Citation Typing Ontology, CiTO v1.6. Upon the creation of version 2.0 of CiTO, a number of new sub-properties of cito:cites were added, and the inverse properties of all the sub-properties of cito:cites were created, all of which are sub-properties of cito:isCitedBy. The ontology has also been integrated with the SWAN Discourse Relationships Ontology by making cito:cites a sub-property of http://purl.org/swan/2.0/discourse-relationships/refersTo. Restrictions of domain and range present in the previous version of CiTO were removed from the object properties when creating CiTO v 2.0, permitting its independent use in other contexts, in addition to conventional bibliographic citations.",

Therefore the concepts and definitions within this standard also align closely with the 2008 SNA manual. It provides a standard system for classifying the financial assets and liabilities of all institutional units within the economy.

Libraries of all kinds, in synagogues and community centers, in Hebrew schools, on college campuses and in research institutions, have adopted the scheme and worked with it. As a result, a body of experience in applying the system to all these diverse institutions developed, clearly demonstrating the need for minimal changes in the system from time to time while reaffirming the utility of its basic organizing principles. Meanwhile, the intervening years have been full of events deeply significant in contemporary Jewish history, all of which need to be reflected in an up-to-date classification scheme.",

    "description": "The lack of a satisfactory classification scheme for the average Jewish library has long been a problem to the Jewish librarian. Many solutions have been suggested and attempted, with varying degrees of success. The classification scheme of the Library of Congress, which has now been adopted by most of the great scholarly Jewish libraries of the country, suffers from the drawbacks of being unknown to most of the general public. On the other hand, the Dewey Decimal System as it stands, although familiar even to school children, presents certain difficulties when applied to a specialized collection. The excessive subdivision required in certain numbers, the lack of provision for certain subject areas which do not fit satisfactorily into the Dewey system, are drawbacks which librarians in the Jewish field have long struggled with. It was to meet these objections that the author devised the present scheme. Although based upon the Dewey system, certain areas have been drastically revised, most notably in the fields of religion, Jewish education, and history. In every case, whether or not explicitly stated, the number refers only to the Jewish aspect of the subject in question. Since the scheme is intended only for Judaica collections, the letter 'z' has been added throughout, to distinguish it from the regular Dewey system. This will be useful in the case of librarians with 'mixed' collections, i.e., containing books of a general as well as of a Jewish nature. This classification scheme is intended primarily for a small Judaica library, such as one in a synagogue or school. Very large or very scholarly collections will probably find the Library of Congress classification more suited to their needs.",

The main thrust of the approach is to make the classification more objective and consistent by specifying quantifiable parameters (traffic, population, spacing) to guide the selection of appropriate road classes. It is also a dynamic system where road classes can be periodically reviewed to adapt to changes in traffic, function etc. The proposed Road Classification System sees Kenya's road network as being composed of two distinct networks i.e. the Rural Roads Network (outside Cities and Municipalities) and the Urban Roads Network (within Cities and Municipalities) for all public roads with 9m or more road reserves. Although the new classification system retains A,B,C,D and E classes, the system has been extended to include additional classes.

    "description": "Although there are many specialized thesauri in the health and the social sciences, the HIV/AIDS Thesaurus is unique in its character and focus.\n\n1. Community-based - We have tried as much as possible to make the thesaurus reflect the language and values of community-based AIDS service organizations, rather than the terminology of technical or medical professions. The thesaurus is, therefore, not based on existing systems such as Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) or Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). For example, we use the term 'Poppers' rather than the more technical term 'Amyl Nitrates', and 'Drug Use' rather than the more judgmental term 'Drug Abuse'.\n\n2. Comprehensive - Resource centres in AIDS service organizations tend to collect a broad range of HIV/AIDS material. The thesaurus reflects this broad scope by covering all aspects of HIV/AIDS: everything from basic science and treatment to prevention, the arts and the psychological, social, and political aspects of the epidemic.\n\n3. Based on Literary Warrant - 'Literary warrant' is a concept librarians use to decide whether the creation of a subject term is justified by the quantity of literature available. We only created subject terms when there were sufficient numbers of books, periodical articles, videos, and audio tapes to warrant the heading. Other subject tools take theory as their point of departure not the production and publication of information. We avoided creating terms simply on the basis of theoretical considerations or out of a sense of symmetry. For instance, we allow for the headings 'Hepatitis B' and 'Hepatitis C', but do not include terms for other types of hepatitis (e.g. hepatitis A, hepatitis D, etc.). This decision was made because 'Hepatitis B' and 'Hepatitis C' are warranted by the number of books and videos on that topic, while books specific to other types of hepatitis are rare in our collection.\n\n4. Based on a Psychosocial, Consumer Health Collection - The first edition of the thesaurus was developed to describe the broad subject scope of books. Narrower terms are added to the second edition so that the thesaurus can be used to describe the more specific content of periodical articles. The thesaurus still remains, however, a list of terms used to describe a psychosocial, consumer health focused collection. The overall depth of the thesaurus has not greatly increased and terms are still more general than terms that would be used to describe articles in a medical or treatment focused collection.",

    "description": "The decision to publish The British Museum materials thesaurus was based on the interest shown in it over the years by visiting documentation specialists, and their requests for copies. In my opinion, the thesaurus is unique, due to the great range of terms included, the inevitable consequence of documenting world-wide collections from almost any historical period, a great variety of cultures, and covering almost any type of object. The eclectic nature of the listing precluded the possibility of importing a thesaurus into our documentation system, and we therefore had to devise our own version. The greatest difficulty lay in providing an overall structure which could accommodate specialised terminology, archaic or local names for certain materials, and everyday nomenclature as well. Our thesaurus indicates one approach, no doubt there are many others (indeed we tried several before settling on the current structure). I am reassured by the fact that our users regularly retrieve records by material, using the thesaurus as a retrieval tool.\n\nThree Top Terms are provided - 'Organic', 'Inorganic' and 'Processed Material' and are generally mutually exclusive. 'Organic' is defined as naturally occurring animal and plant material, and naturally occurring substances derived from them. 'Inorganic' is defined as naturally occurring material which, for the purposes of this thesaurus, is not of organic origin, i.e. mainly minerals and stones. 'Processed material' may be regarded as material which has been manufactured or has undergone some form of processing (such as smelting) to alter it from its original natural state. The definitions of the three categories are provided for general guidance, rather than as strict formulations. It is accepted that there are grey areas, particularly in deciding whether a substance is processed or not. However the primary intention is to group materials in a way which is meaningful to the average user. 2129 terms, 513 relations between terms, 284 non-preferred terms. It is stressed that the final listing is not intended as a scientific classification system, rather it is a reflection of the terminology, both current and historical, in use in curatorial departments in The British Museum.",

    "description": "The panlatine lexicon of economic marketing was developed within the Panlatine Network of Terminology (Realiter) and coordinated by Prof. Dr. Angela Bidu Vrănceanu, University of Bucharest. The final synthesis and editing of the material was made by Roxana Cioloaneanu. The field of economic marketing is relatively new and its dynamics is continuous.The applicative interest of this field is complex and refers to aspects of economy, trade, advertising, communication The list of illustrative terms for this field has been selected and limited to about 150 terms, Since marketing is a complex and heterogeneous domain whose limits are difficult to establish, we have tried to cover different areas of marketing by selecting terms belonging to\n\nOf its various sub-areas, such as: marketing research, promotion policy, consumer behavior, distribution policy. This selection is also motivated by the diachronic evolution of marketing, discussed in the literature as being carried out in three stages: 1) 1900-1920: marketing deals with selling products on the market (sale); 2) The 1950s added a dimension, namely, the advertisement; 3) Due to the economic growth of the 50s and 60s, which led to an increase in competition, sales orientation of marketing has turned into customer orientation (consumer behavior) (see Zollondz 2007: 14-20). The elaboration of the marketing lexicon had as its starting point the Romanian language, the terms being selected from the Romanian specialized dictionaries and checked in specialized texts (scientific texts, didactic texts) and in economic press articles. For each term, equivalents were given in six languages\n\nRomance (taking into account their territorial distribution where appropriate): Catalan, Spanish (Spain, Argentina, Mexico), French (France, Canada), Galician, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil). Also for each term the English equivalent is provided. The terms in the Pantellean Lexicon of Economic Marketing can be consulted in each of the above-mentioned languages ​​by using the alphabetical index for each language. All terms benefit from indicating the appropriate grammatical category. For some terms, quasi (synonyms) and / or writing variants have been recorded. (Cvasi) the synonyms in Romanian appear immediately under the title-term, and for the other Romance languages, they are listed one below the other. The arrow (→) means the reference to another title-term\n\n(Quasi) synonym from the list. The inventory of terms includes both simple terms and terminological terms. The latter were taken over as such by the Romanian specialized dictionaries. For some simple terms, with circulation in other specialized languages, as well as in the common language, deconfiguring contexts, extracts from specialized texts and articles in the press and marked\n\nIn square brackets []. Each of the contributors to the Panlatine Lexicon of Economic Marketing project is responsible for the terms provided as equivalents in that language. We believe that the panlatine lexicon of marketing will facilitate interlingual communication and will satisfy the complex (extralinguistic, linguistic and terminological) interest in this field. The target audience is represented by specialists\n\nIn several areas: economics, commerce, advertising, media and, last but not least, terminologists and linguists.",

This system is the fruit of collaboration between Parks Canada, the Musée de la civilisation and the Société des musées québécois. The definitions of terms are drawn mainly from the Parks Canada document. The classification system makes it possible to group objects in a collection by their original function. It divides them up into a hierarchy in which the smallest unit is the object name, the intermediate unit is the sub-category and the largest unit is the category. This structure makes it possible to organize information on object identification in a logical, meaningful manner. Using a standardized system to divide up information makes it simpler to search for and access records. To maximize system performance, standardized terms must be used to identify the objects. Using the classification system gives a better overview of collections, so that users can spot similarities and differences, groupings and contrasts within a collection itself. In addition to offering better understanding of the content of collections, the classification system promotes reflection on guidelines for collecting, research options and ideal means of sharing the knowledge gained.",

Hierarchical and other standard thesaural relationships were added, as well as explanatory notes where appropriate. The thesaurus architecture is based on ISO 2788. Curatorial advice has been sought at all stages of the project, and a number of publications were consulted, which are listed in the bibliography. Members of the Working Party also contributed extensively to the Museum Documentation Association (mda) Terminology Working Group and to the mda Archaeological Objects Thesaurus Working Party. The initial entries were generated from the object name indexes to the databases, consisting of terms taken from a variety of documentary sources (such as registers, file cards and catalogues). Hence the terms in the thesaurus are not full descriptions of the objects; these are entered in the Description field. The choice of Top Terms and Broad Terms was determined by common retrieval enquiries and by the nature of the British Museum's collections, and includes functional object name categories (e.g. vessel) as well as those referring to an activity (e.g. dance equipment) or concept (e.g. religious/ritual equipment). The addition of the word 'equipment' allows for object names describing ancillary equipment to be included in each category. Thus for example, the music equipment hierarchy incorporates music-book as well as musical instrument.\n\nThe thesaurus reflects the nature of the British Museum collections, and was originally set up as an internal reference tool.

As an indexing tool it is best applicable when indexed material is interdiscliplinary and its themes vary to a great extent.\n\nYSO's hierarchical construction is founded on parent-child relationships. In addition to this, some concepts are supplemented with associative and part-whole relations.\n\nEach concept in YSO is issued to at least one thematic group and some concepts have also been grouped with a non-hierarchical collection label (such as \"clothes by materials\").\n\nFollowing the international standards for thesauri, the terms for concepts are usually plural nouns. Terms in singular are usually mass nouns or terms referring to actions or abstract concepts. Some terms carry a different meaning when used in plural and in singular. For example, ballet refers to an art form and ballets to individual works of art.\n\nYSO is based on General Finnish Thesaurus (YSA) and General Finnish Thesaurus in Swedish (Allärs). Concepts in YSO and concepts in YSA and Allärs have been linked to each other with equivalence relationships. YSO has also been linked to Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH).",

The primary top divisions of CONA are the facets Built Work and Movable Work. With the exception of performance art, CONA records unique physical works. However, CONA may include works that were never built or that no longer exist, for example designs for a building that was not constructed or a work that has been destroyed.\n\nThe primary users of the Getty vocabularies include museums, art libraries, archives, visual resource collection catalogers, bibliographic projects concerned with art, researchers in art and art history, and the information specialists who are dealing with the needs of these users.

They determined that, especially in the digital age,  an authoritative osteopathic thesaurus was essential to the increasing number of professional activities requiring accurate, consistent descriptive terminology. (...) The Authorized Osteopathic Thesaurus (AOT) is the official thesaurus for osteopathic medicine, defining the meaning and interrelationships of those terms that have a unique meaning in osteopathic medicine.\n\nThe goal of the AOT is to standardize the unique diagnostic, therapeutic, and theoretical concepts and terminology of osteopathic philosophy, principles and practice. The Thesaurus includes the preferred form of each term; its definition; references as needed to broader, narrower, and related terms; synonyms; and archaic forms of the term. Abbreviations and acronyms are also included.\n\nThis first edition of the AOT is derived in part from the September 2003 edition of the Glossary of osteopathic terminology.Published biannually by the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine's Educational Council on Osteopathic Principles (ECOP) since 1981, the Glossary was the largest pre-existing authoritative source of osteopathic terms.\n\nThe other primary source was the OSTMED ® subject authority file and bibliographic index to the literature of osteopathic medicine. The 2004 Edition is the first edition of the AOT. We anticipate regularly updating and revising the AOT. Future editions will include more terms and reflect further development of modern osteopathic teaching.

It allows participating countries to classify traded goods on a common basis for customs purposes. At the international level, the Harmonized System (HS) for classifying goods is a six-digit code system.\n\nThe HS comprises approximately 5,300 article/product descriptions that appear as headings and subheadings, arranged in 99 chapters, grouped in 21 sections. The six digits can be broken down into three parts. The first two digits (HS-2) identify the chapter the goods are classified in, e.g. 09 = Coffee, Tea, Maté and Spices. The next two digits (HS-4) identify groupings within that chapter, e.g. 09.02 = Tea, whether or not flavoured. The next two digits (HS-6) are even more specific, e.g. 09.02.10 Green tea (not fermented)... Up to the HS-6 digit level, all countries classify products in the same way (a few exceptions exist where some countries apply old versions of the HS).\n\nThe Harmonized System was introduced in 1988 and has been adopted by most of the countries worldwide. It has undergone several changes in the classification of products. These changes are called revisions and happened in 1996, 2002 and 2007.",

Its main aims are to provide: a basis for the international reporting, comparison and exchange of statistical and administrative data about occupations; a model for the development of national and regional classifications of occupations; and a system that can be used directly in countries that have not developed their own national classifications.\n\nIt is intended for use in statistical applications and in a variety of client oriented applications. Client oriented applications include the matching of job seekers with job vacancies, the management of short or long term migration of workers between countries and the development of vocational training programmes and guidance.\n\nThe first version of ISCO was adopted in 1957 by the Ninth International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS). It is known as ISCO-58. This version was superseded by ISCO-68, which was adopted by the Eleventh ICLS in 1966. The third version, ISCO-88, was adopted by the Fourteenth ICLS in 1987. Many current national occupational classifications are based on one of these three ISCO versions.\n\nISCO has recently been updated to take into account developments in the world of work since 1988 and to make improvements in light of experience gained in using ISCO-88. The updating did not change the basic principles and top structure of ISCO-88 but significant structural changes were made in some areas. The updated classification was adopted in December 2007 and is known as ISCO-08.

It is useful for clinical documentation, communication of care across settings, integration of data across systems and settings, effectiveness research, productivity measurement, competency evaluation, reimbursement, and curricular design. The Classification includes the interventions that nurses do on behalf of patients, both independent and collaborative interventions, both direct and indirect care. An intervention is defined as \"any treatment, based upon clinical judgment and knowledge, that a nurse performs to enhance patient/client outcomes.\" While an individual nurse will have expertise in only a limited number of interventions reflecting on her or his specialty, the entire classification captures the expertise of all nurses. NIC can be used in all settings (from acute care intensive care units, to home care, to hospice, to primary care) and all specialties (from critical care to ambulatory care and long term care). While the entire classification describes the domain of nursing, some of the interventions in the classification are also done by other providers. NIC can be used by other non-physician providers to describe their treatments.\n\nNIC interventions include both the physiological (e.g. Acid-Base Management) and the psychosocial (e.g. Anxiety Reduction). Interventions are included for illness treatment (e.g. Hyperglycemia Management), illness prevention (e.g. Fall Prevention), and health promotion (e.g. Exercise Promotion). Most of the interventions are for use with individuals but many are for use with families (e.g. Family Integrity Promotion), and some are for use with entire communities (e.g. Environmental Management: Community). Indirect care interventions (e.g. Supply Management) are also included. Each intervention as it appears in the classification is listed with a label name, a definition, a set of activities to carry out the intervention, and background readings.\n\nThe 554 interventions in NIC (6th ed.) are grouped into thirty classes and seven domains for ease of use. (...) Each intervention has a unique number (code). The classification is continually updated with an ongoing process for feedback and review. In the back of the book, there are instructions for how users can submit suggestions for modifications to existing interventions or propose a new intervention. All contributors whose changes are included in the next edition are acknowledged in the book. New editions of the classification are planned for approximately every 5 years. The classification was first published in 1992, the second edition in 1996, the third edition in 2000, the fourth edition in 2004, the fifth edition in 2008, and the 6th edition in 2013.",

    "description": "The Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC) is a comprehensive, standardized classification of patient/client outcomes developed to evaluate the effects of interventions provided by nurses or other health care professionals. Standardized outcomes are essential for documentation in electronic records, for use in clinical information systems, for the development of nursing knowledge and the education of professional nurses. An outcome is a measurable individual, family, or community state, behavior or perception that is measured along a continuum and is responsive to nursing interventions. The outcomes are developed for use in all settings and with all patient populations. Clinical sites used to test the NOC included tertiary care hospitals, community hospitals, community agencies, nursing centers, and a nursing home. The outcomes are developed for use in all settings and can be used across the care continuum to follow patient outcomes throughout an illness episode or over an extended period of care. Since the outcomes describe patient/client status, other disciplines may find them useful for the evaluation of their interventions.\n\nThe 490 outcomes in Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC) (5th ed.) are listed in alphabetical order. Each outcome has a definition, a list of indicators that can be used to evaluate patient status in relation to the outcome, a target outcome rating, scale(s) to measure patient status, and a short list of references used in the development and refinement of the outcome. A five-point Likert scale is used with all outcomes and indicators. A rating of a '5' is always the best possible score and '1' is always the worst possible score. Examples of measurement scales used with the outcomes are: 1=Extremely compromised to 5= Not compromised and 1=Never demonstrated to 5=Consistently demonstrated. The NOC outcomes are grouped in a coded taxonomy that organizes the outcomes within a conceptual framework to facilitate identifying an outcome. The 490 outcomes are grouped into thirty-two classes and seven domains for ease of use. The seven domains are: Functional Health, Physiologic Health, Psychosocial Health, Health Knowledge & Behavior, Perceived Health, Family Health, and Community Health. Each outcome has a unique code number that facilitates its use in computerized clinical information systems and allows manipulation of data to answer questions about nursing care quality and effectiveness. The classification is continually updated to include new outcomes and to revise outcomes based on new research or user feedback.",

In order to make calculations of the numbers of species of living algae, note that 68 or so species of flowering plants (seagrasses) are included for the present (under the Phylum Magnoliophyta), and about 2000 fossil algae, mainly calcium- and silica- secreting forms. A few fungal names are included. We are currently revising the classification to take account of some recent phylogenetic studies; however, because of difficulties with the Botanical and Zoological Codes, this may seem very inconsistent in places.\n\nPlants vs Animals\n\nThe age-old question of what is an animal and what is a plant creates classification problems for botanists and zoologists alike, and in many groups the differences are quite unclear. The classification of organisms currently included in AlgaeBase adopted here closely follows a draft classification by Dennis Gordon (Principal Scientist, Aquatic Biodiversity & Biosecurity, National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research, Wellington, New Zealand) and colleagues (including AlgaeBase) in July 2011, with the exception of the euglenoid flagellates and the dinoflagellates for which AlgaeBase has mostly retained the ICBN (botanical) suffixes; however, we have occasionally added the equivalent taxa in zoology. We have largely adopted this classification for the sake of conformity.\n\nFlowering Plants\n\nFor the marine flowering plants we follow Angiosperm Phylogeny Group III system in respect of the Angiosperms in which all seagrasses are in one order, the Alismatales. The family Cymodoceaceae is not recognised currently in this system, but we have retained it for the present. The seagrasses are, of course, not algae, but are included here for convenience.",

Included in GRIN TAXONOMY are scientific names for 26,968 genera (14,279 accepted) and 1,375 infragenera (1,316 accepted) and 103,161 species or infraspecies (61,241 accepted) with common names, geographical distributions, literature references, and economic impacts. Generally recognized standards for abbreviating author's names and botanical literature have been adopted in GRIN. The scientific names are verified, in accordance with the international rules of botanical nomenclature, by taxonomists of the National Germplasm Resources Laboratory using available taxonomic literature and consultations with taxonomic specialists. Included in GRIN TAXONOMY are federal- and state-regulated noxious weeds and federally and internationally listed threatened and endangered plants.",

More than forty new terms have thus been added as main entry or as secondary entry. About the same number of terms have also been completed and exemplified. References to websites where additional information or illustrations can be found are also included.\n\nFinally, it is important to mention the recent edition of the 2003 and 2003 versions of the thesaurus, which, more than mere translations of the French version, are real adaptations to the geographic and cultural worlds of Spanish and English. This second French version of course benefited from the editorial experience gained with the preparation of the Spanish and English versions. A Chinese version was also released very recently.",

    "description": "The 'Glossary of Biotechnology for Food and Agriculture' is a revised, augmented version of the 'Glossary of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering' published by FAO in 1999. The idea for such a collection of terminology associated with the rapidly expanding fields related to or deriving from biotechnology and genetic engineering, was stimulated by the difficulty of communicating effectively in discussions at intergovernmental level. On various occasions, simple differences of interpretation of terminology have threatened to de-rail negotiations of international importance. This Glossary tries to provide a consolidated, comprehensive and yet accessible list of terms and acronyms that are used regularly in biotechnology for food and agriculture and that represent a convenient reference source for researchers, students and technicians. (...) The second edition contained 3,196 terms and related definitions (about 450 new terms, about 100 terms were deleted). A number of definitions were improved to enhance the coherence of the Glossary. The second edition also has a slightly modified title, that reflects more precisely the scope of the Glossary, limited to terms involving biotechnology for food and agriculture. (...) However, FAO does not consider that the process is completed, and inputs from users (suggestions of new terms, comments on current terms, etc.) are encouraged. The new glossary management system introduced in 2012 allows the addition of new terms and definitions as well as their simultaneous translation into Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian, and Spanish, enabling us to keep pace with new developments in the fast progressing field of agricultural biotechnologies.",

It is well recognised that internationally coordinated research and development and exchange of experience can greatly benefit science, technology transfer and the development of the corresponding policy framework across Europe. A major handicap in international collaboration, and a major source of misunderstandings, in these areas is the lack of a standardised terminology. This is not only true for the translation between different languages but also within most languages. (...) The glossary comprises mainly terms concerning manures produced by farm livestock but also includes relevant, broader terms concerning fertilisers, crops, feeding livestock and wider environmental issues. There are also some terms concerning other types of organic materials that are commonly applied to agricultural land. Similarly, although it is primarily a glossary of terms used in Europe, some terms in common use in North America are included.",

As the first results in the development of the thesaurus, were presented at the 46th IDF Congress and Conference, held in Madrid in October 1992.\n\nThe appearance of this thesaurus presents a multiple interest. On the one hand, it is the first thesaurus on Animal Biology created in Spanish language, and represents an advance in the standardization of scientific terminology in Spanish. Secondly, since it was developed from the documentary language of the ICYT database, it has a practical and immediate practical application, since its implementation in the DBMS facilitates both the documentary analysis and the recovery of the scientific literature Spanish in this field. Finally, it provides documentalists, researchers and users in general with a reference frame of reference and a tool that makes the process of retrieving information from bibliographic databases more user-friendly, while increasing the relevance of such retrieval.\n\nThe presentation of a scientific work, of the characteristics of the present, generally implies an invitation to make a recapitulation about the avatars that, during its gestation, have been taking place, and the perspectives and future projects related to The same, which, in a necessarily schematic form, will constitute the basic content of this presentation.",
