BAO is an extensible, knowledge-based, highly expressive (currently SHOIQ(D)) description of biological assays making use of descriptive logic based features of the Web Ontology Language (OWL). BAO currently has over 700 classes and also makes use of several other ontologies. It describes several concepts related to biological screening, including Perturbagen, Format, Meta Target, Design, Detection Technology, and Endpoint. Perturbagens are perturbing agents that are screened in an assay; they are mostly small molecules. Assay Meta Target describes what is known about the biological system and / or its components interrogated in the assay (and influenced by the Perturbagen). Meta target can be directly described as a molecular entity (e.g. a purified protein or a protein complex), or indirectly by a biological process or event (e.g. phosphorylation). Format describes the biological or chemical features common to each test condition in the assay and includes biochemical, cell-based, organism-based, and variations thereof. The assay Design describes the assay methodology and implementation of how the perturbation of the biological system is translated into a detectable signal. Detection Technology relates to the physical method and technical details to detect and record a signal. Endpoints are the final HTS results as they are usually published (such as IC50, percent inhibition, etc). BAO has been designed to accommodate multiplexed assays. All main BAO components include multiple levels of sub-categories and specification classes, which are linked via object property relationships forming an expressive knowledge-based representation.",

The biomarkers, cell types, and anatomical structures are mapped to existing ontologies (Uberon/FMA, CL, HGNC) whenever possible.  All relationships between anatomical structures and from cell types to anatomical structures are valid Uberon and CL relationships. The Spatial Ontology defines the shape, size, location, and rotation of experimental tissue and data major anatomical structures in the 3D Reference Object Library.

    "description": "The CDNO provides structured terminologies to describe nutritional attributes of material entities that contribute to human diet. These terms are intended primarily to be associated with datasets that quantify concentration of chemical nutritional components derived from samples taken from any stage in the production of food raw materials (including from crops, livestock, fisheries) and through processing and supply chains. Additional knowledge associated with these dietary sources may be represented by terms that describe functional, physical and other attributes. Whilst recognising that dietary nutrients within food substrates may be present as complex and dynamic physical and chemical structures or mixtures, CDNO focuses on components typically quantified in an analytical chemistry laboratory. The primary CDNO class \u2018dietary nutritional component\u2019 contains hierarchical sets of terms organised to reflect commonly used classifications of chemical food composition. This class does not represent an exhaustive classification of chemical components, but focuses on structuring terms according to widely accepted categories. This class is independent of, but may be used in conjunction with, classes that describe \u2018analytical methods\u2019 for quantification, \u2018physical properties\u2019 or \u2018dietary function\u2019. Quantification data may be used and reported in research literature, to inform food composition tables and labelling, or for supply chain quality assurance and control. More specifically, terms within the \u2018nutritional component concentration\u2019 class may be used to represent quantification of components described in the \u2018dietary nutritional component\u2019 class. Concentration data are intended to be described in conjunction with post-composed metadata concepts, such as represented by the Food Ontology (FoodOn) \u2018Food product by organism\u2019, which derives from some food or anatomical entity and a NCBI organismal classification ontology (NCBITaxon) entity. The common vocabulary and relationships defined within CDNO should facilitate description, communication and exchange of material entity-derived nutritional composition datasets typically generated by analytical laboratories. The organisation of the vocabulary is structured to reflect common categories variously used by those involved in crop, livestock or other organismal production, associated R&D and breeding, as well as the food processing and supply sector, and nutritionists, inlcuding compilers and users of food composition databases. The CDNO therefore supports characterisation of genetic diversity and management of biodiversity collections, as well as sharing of knowledge relating to dietary composition between a wider set of researchers, breeders, farmers, processors and other stakeholders. Further development of the functional class should also assist in understanding how interactions between organismal genetic and environmental variation contribute to human diet and health in the farm to fork continuum.",

This file contains pre-coordinated phenotype terms, definitions and synonyms that can be used to describe mammalian phenotypes. The ontology is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). It organizes phenotype terms into major biological system headers such as nervous system and respiratory system.  This ontology is currently under development.

    "description": "This artefact is an MSI-approved controlled vocabulary primarily developed under COSMOS EU and PhenoMeNal EU governance. The nmrCV is supporting the nmrML XML format with standardized terms. nmrML is a vendor agnostic open access NMR raw data standard. Its primaly role is analogous to the mzCV for the PSI-approved mzML XML format. It uses BFO2.0 as its Top level. This CV was derived from two predecessors (The NMR CV from the David Wishart Group, developed by Joseph Cruz) and the MSI nmr CV developed by Daniel Schober at the EBI.  This simple taxonomy of terms (no DL semantics used) serves the nuclear magnetic resonance markup language (nmrML) with meaningful descriptors to amend the nmrML xml file with CV terms. Metabolomics scientists are encouraged to use this CV to annotrate their raw and experimental context data, i.e. within nmrML. The approach to have an exchange syntax mixed of an xsd and CV stems from the PSI mzML effort. The reason to branch out from an xsd into a CV is, that in areas where the terminology is likely to change faster than the nmrML xsd could be updated and aligned, an externally and decentrallised maintained CV can accompensate for such dynamics in a more flexible way. A second reason for this set-up is that semantic validity of CV terms used in an nmrML XML instance (allowed CV terms, position/relation to each other, cardinality) can be validated by rule-based proprietary validators:  By means of cardinality specifications and XPath expressions defined in an XML mapping file (an instances of the CvMappingRules.xsd ), one can define what ontology terms are allowed in a specific location of the data model.",

By sequence homology data, we mostly mean gene region, gene and protein centric orthology, paralogy, and xenology information. Depending on the database, the homology information is structured in different ways. ORTH ontology accommodates these disparate data structures namely Hierarchical Orthologous Group (HOG), cluster of homologous sequences and homologous-pairwise relations between sequences. In addition to the specific ORTH terms, this specification includes terms of the imported ontologies (e.g. Semanticscience Integrated Ontology, SIO) which are pertinents to represent the information from various orthology databases in a homogeneous way.",

Visual and textual entities include charts, tables, and graphs that display performance information. PSDO's domain focus is healthcare organizations that use clinical quality dashboards and feedback interventions for healthcare professionals and teams. Performance information is commonly about the quality of care and health outcomes that have been derived from clinical data using performance measures (aka metrics, process indicators, quality measures, etc).
