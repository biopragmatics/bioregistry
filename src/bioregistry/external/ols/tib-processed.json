    "description": "CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology, is an ontology written in OWL 2 DL to enable characterization of the nature or type of citations, both factually and rhetorically, and to permit these descriptions to be published on the Web.  \n\nThe citations characterized may be either direct and explicit (as in the reference list of a journal article), indirect (e.g. a citation to a more recent paper by the same research group on the same topic), or implicit (e.g. as in artistic quotations or parodies, or in cases of plagiarism).\n\nCiTO contains the object property cito:cites and its sub-properties, and its inverse property cito:isCitedBy, from the original Citation Typing Ontology, CiTO v1.6.  Upon the creation of version 2.0 of CiTO, a number of new sub-properties of cito:cites were added, and the inverse properties of all the sub-properties of cito:cites were created, all of which are sub-properties of cito:isCitedBy.  The ontology has also been integrated with the SWAN Discourse Relationships Ontology by making cito:cites a sub-property of http://purl.org/swan/2.0/discourse-relationships/refersTo.\n\nRestrictions of domain and range present in the previous version of CiTO were removed from the object properties when creating CiTO v 2.0, permitting its independent use in other contexts, in addition to conventional bibliographic citations.  \n\nSo that they can be used independently, other entities that were previously included in CiTO v1.6 have now been made components of other SPAR ontologies: FaBiO, the FRBR-aligned Bibliographic Ontology; C4O, the Citation Counting and Context Characterization Ontology; and PSO, the Publication Status Ontology. \n\nThe addition of two new properties:cito:usesConclusionsFrom and its inverse cito:providesConclusionsFor on 09Dec2011 led to a version number increment from v2.0 to v2.1.\n\nThe addition of two additional properties, cito:compiles and cito:isCompiledBy, previously in the deprecated CiTO4Data ontology, on 03 July 2012 led to a version increment from v2.1 to v2.2.\n\nSubsequent expansions include:\n\nin versions 2.3 and 2.4 the addition of the object properties cito:citesAsPotentialSolution, cito:citesAsRecommendedReading, cito:repliesTo, cito:retracts, cito:speculates on, and their inverse properties;\n\nin v2.5 the addition of cito:CitationAct, cito:hasCitationEvent, cito:hasCitedEntity and cito:hasCitingEntity;\n\nin v 2.6: \nrenaming cito:hasCitationEvent to become cito:hasCitationCharacterization;\nimproving definitions of cito:CitationAct, cito:hasCitationCharacterization, cito:hasCitedEntity and cito:hasCitingEntity;\nrevising the definition of cito:isCompiledBy to correct it and bring it into line with the DataCite Metadata Kernel v2.2 definition;\nchanging the definition of cito:sharesAuthorsWith from 'An object property indicating that the citing entity has at least one author in common with the cited entity.' to 'An object property between two entities indicating that they have at least one author in common.' so that it can be used when one entity does not actually cite the other;\nadding the object properties cito:hasRelatedEntity, cito:sharesFundingAgencyWith and cito:sharesAuthorInstitutionWith;\nand adding the text 'An object property indicating that . . .' at the beginning of the textual definition (rdfs:comment) for each CiTO object property.\n\nin v 2.6.1:\nRemoved text 'An object property indicating that . . .' added in v 2.6 at the beginning of the textual definition (rdfs:comment) for each CiTO object property, so that each definition is just a direct statement of the relationship.  \nRemoved the property cito:hasRelatedEntity (in favour of using dcterms:relation).\nRenamed cito:hasReply to become cito:hasReplyFrom.\nImproved the textual definitions of cito:derides and its inverse property.\n\nin v 2.6.2:\nImproved definitions of of cito:CitationAct, cito:hasCitationCharacterization, cito:hasCitedEntity and cito:hasCitingEntity.\n\nin v 2.6.3:\nAdded examples for each citation type (i.e., all the subproperties of cito:cites).\n\nin v 2.6.4:\nAdded alignment with schema:citation.\n\nin v 2.7.0:\nAdded new property cito:linksTo, and corrected some property URL.\n\nin v 2.7.1\nCorrected some typos in property comments.\n\nin v 2.7.2\nThe name of the class cito:CitationAct has been changed to cito:Citation, and its definition has been modified. The property cito:hasCitationTimeSpan has been added.\n\nin v 2.7.3\nAdded the class cito:SelfCitation, i.e. citation in which the citing and the cited entities have at least one author in common.\n\nin v 2.8\nRenamed the class cito:SelfCitation in cito:AuthorSelfCitation. Created a new class cito:SelfCitation with a more general definition (citation in which the citing and the cited entities have something significant in common with one another), which now includes five subclasses: cito:AuthorSelfCitation, cito:JournalSelfCitation, cito:FunderSelfCitation, cito:AffiliationSelfCitation, cito:AuthorNetworkSelfCitation. The latter class is also accompanied by the new data property cito:hasCoAuthorCitationLevel, which specifies the minimal distance that one of the authors of a citing entity has with regards to one of the authors of a cited entity according to their co-author network. Added the object properties cito:sharesPublicationVenueWith and its subproperty cito:sharesJournalWith. Added the data property cito:hasCitationCreationDate, and changed the domain of cito:hasCitationTimeSpan with xsd:duration.\n\nin v 2.8.1\nRenamed the property cito:hasCoAuthorCitationLevel in cito:hasCoAuthorshipCitationLevel.",

The ontology supports a generic damage modeling approach and therefore could be applied for any type of degradation as well as for any construction type (e.g. buildings or bridges). Damage representations can be modeled either as damaged areas (dot:DamageArea) or elementary damage elements (dot:DamageElement). Thereby, instances of dot:DamageElement should be aggregated in a dot:DamageArea, however significant damages e.g. large cracks could be modelled as dot:DamageElement without dot:DamageArea. For grouping multiple coherent damages, a damage pattern could be defined by using dot:DamagePattern as third type for damage representation. Besides the topological damage classes, damage can also be categorized acording to a certain damage type using subclasses of dot:ClassifiedDamage as defined in extensions of DOT. A division between structural and non-structural damage is made by using the dot:StructuralDamage or dot:Defect classes. In addition to the topology, damage documentation that is commonly created during inspections and damage assessment can be linked to the damages as well as to the damaged components.",

    "description": "Many testbeds owning devices or applications interacting with the sensors, store their inherent observations and other related data in their own proprietary format. In other words, making a testbed independent and isolated from others that cannot directly interact with each other. Differences in the data format lead to interoperability issues between the testbeds and much work has to be done in order to ensure the compatibility. One has to understand different data formats and create the mapping between them. As a result, a testbed must understand other testbed's format and create the mapping both while sending and receiving information. One method to accomplish interoperability is through the usage of semantic-based technologies to annotate all the information shared by the platforms. Nevertheless, some of the relevant existing ontologies promise interoperability but: \n\n- do not address the problem to describe the observation in an interoperable manner to ease further tasks, such as reasoning, \n- many of them are domain-specific and cannot be applied across domains, \n- they have missing concepts and do not suffice the needs of the measurements provided by the sensors, and \n- many ontologies do not follow best practices making it hard to correctly interpret and reuse concepts.\n\n\nIn order to address the above-mentioned limitations, we provide FIESTA-IoT ontology (a unified semantic model) that follows best practices. FIESTA-IoT Ontology is a merge of concepts from various ontologies such as IoT-lite, M3-lite Taxonomy, SSN, Time and DUL (see Figure 1). The FIESTA-IoT Ontology is divided into 2 parts: resource description and observations produced. One has to follow the Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively, for understanding what all concepts are associated with resource description and observation. Using such information testbeds can annotate their data to FIESTA-IoT specific requirements and the annotators developed can achieve FIESTA-IoT certification. For reference we provide sample annotations as figure (see Figure 4 and Figure 5) for both resource graph and observation graph.\n\nFor more details please see:\n\n- R. Agarwal, D. Fernandez, T.

    "description": "This is an ontology draft for the description of metadata of traffic observations, in particular video recordings of road traffic. The traffic observations are e.g. used to design test scenarios for the effectiveness assessment of automated driving systems. \n\nThe ontology draft resulted from an exchange of the Chair of Automobile Engineering at TU Dresden (https://tu-dresden.de/bu/verkehr/iad/kft?set_language=en) with representatives of NFDI4Ing (Community Cluster 4.4, Archetype Golo, Base Services S3) and FID move in NFDI4Ing's Special Interest Group \"Metadata and Ontologies\". An essential part of that meeting was the presentation of the reseaerch data management approach at the Chair of Automobile Engineering, in particular its tooling, its metadata approach and its workflow.\n\nTraffic observations are managed with ListDB, a solution combined of a SharePoint instance and a virtual machine for data servicing . An accompanying Codebook defines relevant metadata that should be provided for each road traffic observation. ListDB is currently used internally within TU Dresden, but is intentended to be hosted publicly until spring 2023. \n\nThe ontology draft is, in fact, based on the Codebook (v. 1.0.0.) and an attempt to make a machine-readable document out of it, applying standards from the Semantic Web Stack (RDF(S) and OWL). The draft is constantly being developed further in this context.",

This ontology allows a thorough description of the whole data generation process (experiment, observation, simulation), embracing the object of investigation, all sample and data manipulation procedures, a summary of the data files and the information contained, and all personal and institutional roles. The subordinate classes and relations can be built according to the two principles of _inheritance_ and _modularity_. _Inheritance_ means that a subclass inherits all properties of its superordinate class, possibly adding some new ones. _Modularity_ means that all expansions are independent of each other; this makes possible for instance to generate expanded ontologies for any possible combinations of method \u00d7 object of research.",

    "description": "The Audio Commons Ontology has been created in the context of the European project [Audio Commons](https://www.audiocommons.org/), which were aimed at favouring sharing and reuse of audio content (both of musical and non-musical nature), specially using [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) licenses.\n\nIt is designed specifically to integrate access to multiple heterogeneously structured audio content providers. In particular the following ones have been considered in the project:\n- [Freesound](https://freesound.org/), a collaborative database of Creative Commons Licensed sounds;\n- [Jamendo](https://www.jamendo.com/), a music website for independent artists;\n- [Europeana Sounds](https://www.eusounds.eu/), a European project collecting and sharing data from several archives of sounds and sound-related media;\n- [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), a non-profit library of millions of freely accessible media contents.\n\n### The base model\n<center> ![A diagram showing the entities Work, Expression, Manifestation, Item](./img/FRBR-Group-1-entities-and-basic-relations.svg.png) </center>\nThe Audio Commons ontology is based on [Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_Requirements_for_Bibliographic_Records), a bibliographic model designed for user tasks of retrieval and access in online library catalogues and bibliographic databases. FRBR distinguish the products of intellectual or artistic endeavor in four main classes: work, expression, manifestation, item. It is available as RDF vocabulary at https://vocab.org/frbr/core. For further information on FRBR, check the [standard](https://repository.ifla.org/handle/123456789/811).\n\nAnother important model related to audio is the [Music Ontology](http://musicontology.com/), which is also based on the FRBR model. Our ontology is more generic than the Music Ontology but is interoperable with it to support the specificities of music-related audio content.\n\nThe Audio Commons ontology works also in conjunction with\n- [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/) for basic metadata,\n- [EBU Core](https://www.ebu.ch/metadata/ontologies/ebucore/) for technical properties of audio files,\n- [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/) to support taxonomic classifications,\n- [Creative Commons Licensing schema](https://creativecommons.org/ns) to represent media licensing,\n- [Event ontology](http://motools.sf.net/event/event.html) for the formalisation of events,\n- [Audio Features Ontology](https://w3id.org/afo/onto/) for the characterisation of audio features.\n\n### Ontology overview\n\n![A diagram showing the main classes of the Audio Commons ontology](./img/AC-Ontology-Skeleton.png)\n\nThe figure above shows the most general classes and properties of the Audio Commons ontology and their relationship with classes of the FRBR and the Music Ontology:\n- **`ac:AudioExpression`**, the specific intellectual or artistic form that a work takes each time it is _realised_, in the audio domain, e.g., the recording or synthesis of music or sounds;\n- **`ac:AudioManifestation`**, the physical embodiment of an audio expression, e.g., a musical track, a sound, an album; \n- **`ac:AudioItem`**, a single exemplar of an audio manifestation, e.g., a copy of a CD or a specific media file.\n\nThe FRBR class Work, representing a distinct intellectual or artistic creation on a more conceptual level, has not been specialised in Audio Commons.\n\nThe Audio Commons ontology provides a generic schema for audio classification through the property **`ac:audioCategory`** that associates any audio expression, manifestation, or item to some generic **`ac:AudioCategory`**. These two terms can be specialised to provide spefic categorisations.\n\n### Manifestations: audio clips and collections\n\n![A diagram showing the main classes of the Audio Commons ontology](./img/AC-Ontology-Manifestation.png)\n\nThe figure above shows classes and properties related to audio manifestations. An instance of **`ac:AudioClip`**, a subclass of `ac:AudioManifestation`, is any audio segment that has been published in some form or uploaded for consumption, for example, a track in a music label's repository or a sound in an audio repository, library or archive.\n\nThe class **`ac:AudioCollection`**, another subclass of `ac:AudioManifestation`, is used to represent collections of audio clips. The class **`ac:AudioCollectionNode`** is used to represent single nodes of a collection, offering local information like the index in the collection and pointers to previous and next nodes. The separation between the collection node and its actual content (e.g., an `ac:AudioClip`) permits the same content to be shared in multiple collections.\n\nThe content of each node of a collection is not limited to an `ac:AudioClip`, but may contain any `ac:AudioManifestation`. Collections can thus contain other collections to support specific cases, e.g. a mapping to the Music Ontology model where an `mo:Release` can contain multiple `mo:Record`(s) that can in turn contain multiple `mo:Track`(s).\n### Items: audio files\n![A diagram showing ac:Item class and related class and properties](./img/AC-Ontology-Item.png)\n\nAn `ac:AudioItem` is a concrete exemplar of an audio manifestation. In our domain, the main exemplars are the actual audio files. \n\nThe corresponding class **`ac:AudioFile`** is a subclass of `ac:AudioItem`. It is subclass of `ebu:MediaResource` too and the corresponging properties of EBU Core can be used to describe the file (e.g., `ebu:hasEncodingFormat`, `ebu:fileSize`).\n\n### Expressions: audio signals\n![A diagram showing ac:Expression class and related class and properties](./img/AC-Ontology-Expression.png)\n\nWhile `ac:AudioFile` represents a concrete file encoded in a certain format, **`ac:DigitalSignal`** is the representation of the corresponding digital signal. `ac:DigitalSignal` is a subclass of `ac:MusicalExpression`. \n\nThe data properties `ac:sampleRate`, `ac:bitsPerSample`, and `ac:channels`, associate a signal with its basic features specific to digital representations.\n\nThe property `ac:publicationOf` can be used to associate an `ac:AudioClip` with the corresponding digital signal. The property `ac:encodes` instead, associates an `ac:AudioFile` with the encoded digital signal.\n\n### Events: recording/syntesis\n![A diagram showing ac:SignalProduction class and related class and properties!](./img/AC-Ontology-SignalProduction.png)\n\nThe description of temporal events is crucial to formalise and document transitions in the workflow of audio production and publication. The class `event:Event` of the Event Ontology is thus specialised for specific actions that are interesting for the audio domain.\n\nUsing the `event:Event` class, details of an event such as its location in time and space, its factor and its products may be explicitly described. Moreover, events can be composed using the property `event:sub_event`, to build complex events.\n\nThe class `ac:SignalProduction` represents the act of producing a `ac:Signal`, which could be either an `ac:AnalogSignal` or a `ac:DigitalSignal`. This is complemented by **`ac:Recording`**, representing the process of recording a sound (`ac:Sound`) or the product of **`ac:Synthesis`**, in case of artificially generated sounds. \n\n### Events (continued): publication\n![A diagram showing ac:Publication class and related class and properties!](./img/AC-Ontology-Publication.png)\n\nThe event **`ac:AudioPublication`** represents the public release of a piece of work, e.g., the release of a new album by a band.\n\n### Usage Example\n![A diagram showing an example of ontology usage!](./img/AC_Example-AudioClip.png)\n\nThe figure above shows an example of use of the Audio Commons ontology to represent a sound from the Freesound database. For simplicity only the classes `ac:AudioClip`, `ac:AudioFile`, and `ac:AudioCategory` are used in this case.",

This simple taxonomy of terms (no DL semantics used) serves the nuclear magnetic resonance markup language (nmrML) with meaningful descriptors to amend the nmrML xml file with CV terms. Metabolomics scientists are encouraged to use this CV to annotrate their raw and experimental context data, i.e. within nmrML. The approach to have an exchange syntax mixed of an xsd and CV stems from the PSI mzML effort. The reason to branch out from an xsd into a CV is, that in areas where the terminology is likely to change faster than the nmrML xsd could be updated and aligned, an externally and decentrallised maintained CV can accompensate for such dynamics in a more flexible way. A second reason for this set-up is that semantic validity of CV terms used in an nmrML XML instance (allowed CV terms, position/relation to each other, cardinality) can be validated by rule-based proprietary validators: By means of cardinality specifications and XPath expressions defined in an XML mapping file (an instances of the CvMappingRules.xsd ), one can define what ontology terms are allowed in a specific location of the data model.",

    "description": "With this artifact, the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Controlled Vocabulary (nmrCV) is undergoing a significant evolution to become an ontology designed to describe NMR spectroscopy experiments and their outputs in detail, supporting FAIR research data management. Initially, nmrCV v1.1.0 was deliberately designed as a controlled vocabulary, not a formal ontology with Description Logic (DL) semantics. It was approved by th Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI) and serves to provide descriptors for the nuclear magnetic resonance markup language (nmrML), enabling vendor-agnostic NMR data sharing, particularly within NMR metabolomics. Since version 1.1.0, nmrCV had not been updated nor actively maintained.\n\nRecognizing the need for a DL-enabled NMR spectroscopy ontology suitable for use independently of nmrML within a larger ontology framework, and addressing the limitations of the original controlled vocabulary, Germany&apos;s National Research Data Infrastructure project for Chemistry (NFDI4Chem) took on the responsibility for nmrCV&apos;s further development and maintenance. This decision was made after a discussion about its optimal integration within the broader ontology landscape at the third Ontologies4Chem workshop in fall 2023.\n\nThe decision to build upon nmrCV v1.1.0 was based on its existing definition of essential concepts, its BFO alignment, and its planned integration with ontologies like the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) and the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI). Improvements in the present version include replacing out-of-scope and placeholder terms with more suitable equivalents from established ontologies like OBI and ChEBI, adhering to the OBO Foundry principles, corrections regarding the BFO subsumption and other established ontology design patterns, as well as the introduction of DL semantics.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Compatibility Note: Due to these significant changes, which prioritize ontology rigor over nmrML alignment, this and future versions of nmrCV may introduce breaking changes for nmrML users. Therefore, nmrML users are strongly advised to thoroughly test new nmrCV versions before production deployment. Alternatively, users may choose to continue using nmrCV v1.1.0, which was specifically designed for nmrML compatibility.",

    "description": "The Austrian Fields of Science and Technology Classification (\u00d6FOS 2012) is the Austrian version of the revised international Fields of Science and Technology Classification of the OECD (FOS) published in the Frascati Manual 2015 as Fields of Research and Development (FORD). These fields are adjusted to national needs, whose application for international comparisons is binding, particularly within the European Statistical System. The six major Fields of Science: Natural Sciences; Technical Sciences; Human Medicine, Health Sciences; Agricultural Sciences, Veterinary Medicine; Social Sciences and Humanities remained unchanged in comparison to \u00d6FOS 2002. In order to ensure international comparability, the previous 2-digit levels from 2002, which are no longer applicable, were replaced by new 3-digit levels (groups) according to the international FOS respectively FORD. These 3-digit levels were provided with further sub-groups (4-digits) taking into account the comments of the international classification. It is therefore feasible that the new Austrian Fields of Science adapt to national peculiarities of the Austrian research activities. The research area with the corresponding 6-digits in alphabetical order serves as a description of the fields of activities and research projects and/or for the coverage of the main scientific activities of a statistical unit in the research and development surveys.

    "description": "The PMD Core Ontology (PMDco) is a comprehensive framework for representing knowledge that encompasses fundamental concepts from the domains of materials science and engineering (MSE). The PMDco has been designed as a mid-level ontology to establish a connection between specific MSE application ontologies and the domain neutral concepts found in established top-level ontologies. The primary goal of the PMDco is to promote interoperability between diverse domains. PMDco's class structure is both understandable and extensible, making it an efficient tool for organizing MSE knowledge. It serves as a semantic intermediate layer that unifies MSE knowledge representations, enabling data and metadata to be systematically integrated on key terms within the MSE domain. With PMDco, it is possible to seamlessly trace data generation. By building on this foundation, PMDco facilitates the integration of data from various sources and the creation of complex workflows. In summary, PMDco is a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in the MSE domains. It provides a common language for representing and sharing knowledge, allowing for efficient collaboration and promoting interoperability between diverse domains. Its design allows for the systematic integration of data and metadata, enabling seamless traceability of data generation. Overall, PMDco is a crucial step towards a unified and comprehensive understanding of the MSE domain.
