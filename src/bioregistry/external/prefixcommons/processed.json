The Expedited Process MTA, in which we created a network of institutions that agree to the terms of transfer in advance of a material request, eliminates these delays.  By creating a repository of plasmids and expediting the process for receiving these plasmids, we strive to accelerate the accessibility and pace of scientific discovery.",
