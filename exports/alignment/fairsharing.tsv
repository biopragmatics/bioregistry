FAIRsharing.119q9t		The UMLS Semantic Network	The UMLS Semantic Network is one of three UMLS Knowledge Sources developed as part of the Unified Medical Language System project. The network provides a consistent categorization of all concepts represented in the UMLS Metathesaurus. The Semantic Network consists of (1) a set of broad subject categories, or Semantic Types, that provide a consistent categorization of all concepts represented in the UMLS Metathesaurus, and (2) a set of useful and important relationships, or Semantic Relations, that exist between Semantic Types. The Network provides information about the set of basic semantic types, or categories, which may be assigned to these concepts, and it defines the set of relationships that may hold between the semantic types. The Semantic Network contains 127 semantic types and 54 relationships. The Semantic Network serves as an authority for the semantic types that are assigned to concepts in the Metathesaurus. The Network defines these types, both with textual descriptions and by means of the information inherent in its hierarchies.

FAIRsharing.1d817c	AGLDWG PID Namespace	Australian Government Link Data Working Group Persistent Identification Namespace	The Australian Government Linked Data Working Group (AGLDWG) advocates the use of Linked Data as a particular set of technologies to be used for Internet-distributed, machine-readable data and, due to this, advocates the use of Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) as identifiers for things. The linked.data.gov.au namespace was implemented by the AGLDWG to govern Linked Data resources for Australia. The namespace uses pattern which can be used to create individual PIDs for infinitely many persistent identifiers for Australian Government Linked Data resources. The namespace uses a domain name that is not coupled to a particular agency's name or function. Use of this namespace was initiated in 2016 and then strengthened in 2018 with multiple Australian government agencies signing a Memorandum of Understanding to reserve the use of linked.data.gov.au for PID IRIs and to ensure its operational stability. The AGLDWG has adopted the IS0 19135 for IRI registration procedure and roles and issued Guidelines that details its PID allocation process.

FAIRsharing.2bf47f	DIDs	Decentralized Identifiers	Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID refers to any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) as determined by the controller of the DID. In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, DIDs have been designed so that they may be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities. Specifically, while other parties might be used to help enable the discovery of information related to a DID, the design enables the controller of a DID to prove control over it without requiring permission from any other party. DIDs are URIs that associate a DID subject with a DID document allowing trustable interactions associated with that subject.

FAIRsharing.2rm2b3	PROV-O	W3C Provenance Ontology	The PROV Ontology (PROV-O) expresses the PROV Data Model using the OWL2 Web Ontology Language (OWL2). It is intended for the Linked Data and Semantic Web community. It provides a set of classes, properties, and restrictions that can be used to represent and interchange provenance information generated in different systems and under different contexts. It can also be specialized to create new classes and properties to model provenance information for different applications and domains. PROV-O is one serialization of PROV-DM, the other two being PROV-N and PROV-XML. PROV-DM and PROV-O define how to represent provenance on the World Wide Web, and as such additional documentation has been included in this record for PROV-AQ (Access and Query), a note which describes how standard web protocols may be used to locate, retrieve and query provenance records. PROV-DC provides a mapping from Dublin Core to PROV-O, and is listed in this record. For the purpose of this specification, provenance is defined as a record that describes the people, institutions, entities, and activities involved in producing, influencing, or delivering a piece of data or a thing. In particular, the provenance of information is crucial in deciding whether information is to be trusted, how it should be integrated with other diverse information sources, and how to give credit to its originators when reusing it. In an open and inclusive environment such as the Web, where users find information that is often contradictory or questionable, provenance can help those users to make trust judgements.
FAIRsharing.2rzyrx	DCO	Dispedia Core Ontology	This resource is no longer available because its underlying source material is not in scope for FAIRsharing.
FAIRsharing.2xahkx	NIFDYS	Neuroscience Information Framework Dysfunction	This ontology contains the former BIRNLex-Disease, version 1.3.2. -- The BIRN Project lexicon will provide entities for data and database annotation for the BIRN project, covering anatomy, disease, data collection, project management and experimental design. It is built using the organizational framework provided by the foundational Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It uses an abstract biomedical layer on top of that - OBO-UBO which has been constructed as a proposal to the OBO Foundry. This is meant to support creating a sharable view of core biomedical objects such as biomaterial_entity, and organismal_entity that all biomedical ontologies are likely to need and want to use with the same intended meaning. The BIRNLex was intended to serve as the basis for construction of a formal ontology for the multiscale investigation of neurological disease.
FAIRsharing.2ZShyL		Ethnology vocabulary	"The Ethnology vocabulary is a controlled vocabulary used for indexing the bibliographical records for the now-archived ""Ethnology"" FRANCIS database (1972 - 2015, http://pascal-francis.inist.fr/).

FAIRsharing.30vmv9		BioSignalML Ontology	An ontology for working with biosignals. This ontology defines concepts to describe the storage and exchange of biosignals, regardless of their underlying data format, and provides terms for common biosignal metadata.
FAIRsharing.31venv	DCO-DEBUGIT	DebugIT Core Ontology	The Debugit Core Ontology (dco) covers the complete conceptual space of the domain of interest in the DebugIT project. It focuses on the management of antibiotics resistance within hospitals and infectious diseases to cover the clinical monitoring use cases. The ontology shall provide a semantic reference as logically defined classes in a formal and computer understandable format. It is supposed to formally represent all basic kinds of entities in the domain of interest, together with their invariant and context-independent properties. The ontology is therefore distinct from the representation of clinical knowledge as targeted by the DebugIT WP 4. Instead, it has a supportive semantic glue Function as it provides standardized and formally described meaning identifiers across the whole project, hence serving the Interoperability platform as well.
FAIRsharing.322dc0		BioSamples identifier	Identifier schema for BioSamples. The BioSample Database stores information about biological samples used in molecular experiments, such as sequencing, gene expression or proteomics. It includes reference samples, such as cell lines, which are repeatedly used in experiments. Accession numbers for the reference samples will be exchanged with a similar database at NCBI, and DDBJ (Japan). Record access may be affected due to different release cycles and inter-institutional synchronisation.
FAIRsharing.33aa85	ISO 639-3	ISO 639-3 Codes for the representation of names of languages - Part 3: Alpha-3 code for comprehensive coverage of languages	ISO 639-3 provides a comprehensive set of identifiers for all languages for use in a wide range of applications, including linguistics, lexicography and internationalization of information systems. It attempts to represent all known full languages. ISO 639 provides three language code sets: one is a two-letter code (ISO 639-1) and two others are three-letter codes (ISO 639-2 and ISO 639-3) for the representation of names of languages. The three-letter codes in ISO 639-2 and ISO 639-3 are complementary and compatible. The two codes have been devised for different purposes. The set of individual languages listed in ISO 639-2 is a subset of those listed in ISO 639-3. The codes differ in that ISO 639-2 includes code elements representing some individual languages and also collections of languages, while ISO 639-3 includes code elements for all known individual languages but not for collections of languages. Overall, the set of individual languages listed in ISO 639-3 is much larger than the set of individual languages listed in ISO 639-2.

This model is freely available for third parties to use to model their data, either for their independent use or to permit their data, conformed to the OpenCitations Data Model, to be published on their behalf by OpenCitations.
FAIRsharing.3dm6gm	EHDA	Edinburgh Human Developmental Anatomy	A structured controlled vocabulary of stage-specific anatomical structures of the human. It has been designed to mesh with the mouse anatomy (EMAP ontology) and incorporates each Carnegie stage of development (CS1-20). The timed version of the human developmental anatomy ontology gives all the tissues present at each Carnegie Stage (CS) of human development (1-20) linked by a part-of rule. Each term is mentioned only once so that the embryo at each stage can be seen as the simple sum of its parts. Users should note that tissues that are symmetric (e.g. eyes, ears, limbs) are only mentioned once. The EHDA; Hunter et al. 2003 is less complete than later versions: it comprises a set of ontologies, one for each Carnegie stage (CS) (1–20) that only includes basic part_of data. Its structure was derived from the original EMAP ontology, and its content was based partly on this and partly on a limited study of sectioned human material.
FAIRsharing.3e603c	PURL	Persistent Uniform Resource Locator	PURLs are Web addresses or Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) that act as permanent identifiers in the face of a dynamic and changing Web infrastructure. Instead of resolving directly to Web resources (documents, data, services, people, etc.). PURLs allow third party control over both URL resolution and resource metadata provision. A URL is simply an address of a resource on the World Wide Web. A Persistent URL is an address on the World Wide Web that causes a redirection to another Web resource. If a Web resource changes location (and hence URL), a PURL pointing to it can be updated. A user of a PURL always uses the same Web address, even though the resource in question may have moved. PURLs may be used by publishers to manage their own information space or by Web users to manage theirs; a PURL service is independent of the publisher of information. Please note that the referenced homepage contains links to an archived google code site, and may not refer to the current specification location. Please get in touch with us if you have more information.
FAIRsharing.3fc9zf	openEHR	openEHR Health Record Specification	openEHR is an open standard that uses a novel two-level modelling methodology to represent health information and meta-data by preserving the semantics during when it were created. It enables semantic interoperability and makes it possible to link disparate data sources easily and safely. It also allows for terminology binding which provides the bridge between the 'terminology' and 'information model' this making it much more useful than using these standards separately. Although openEHR is a de-facto standard that is developed by volunteers openly, ISO and CEN adopted it (ISO/EN 13606) so it is a full international standard. It has relationship and mappings between other standards, such as HL7.
FAIRsharing.3ftws4	OGR	Ontology of Geographical Region	This OWL ontology classified the geograhical regions related vocabularies extracted from UMLS. It must be used with other two ontologies, in the case of diabetes: the Ontology of Glucose Metabolism Disorder (OGMD) and the Ontology for Genetic Disease Investigations (OGDI). Together, these three ontologies form the Ontology for Genetic Susceptibility Factor (OGSF), which is the project where information about this ontology is stored.
FAIRsharing.3fyavr	OBIws	Bioinformatics Web Service Ontology	The Bioinformatics Web Services ontology (OBIws) is an ontology that extends the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) to build an ontology that supports consistent annotation of bioinformatics Web services. We follow a systematic methodology for enriching OBI with terms to support Web service annotation. This process involves the design of ontology analysis diagrams for Web services and their subsequent analysis to discover terms that need to be added to the ontology. Current OBIws ontology is focusing on sequence analysis web services. With developed patterns of modeling web services, OBIws can be extended easily to support annotations of different kind web services.

FAIRsharing.43m9f6	SYN	Sage Bionetworks Synapse Ontology	This resource is no longer available because its underlying source material is not in scope for FAIRsharing.
FAIRsharing.446bv0	OoEVV	Ontology of Experimental Variables and Values	The Ontology of Experimental Variables and Values (OoEVV) provides a lightweight representation of (a) the variables used to measure experimental properties and (b) the measurement scales that form the complex data types supporting that data. Many different variables measure the same thing, here we use a lightweight representation driven by a small number of classes and a large number of variables to focus only on providing a vocabulary of variables that may be extended for consolidation to standardized variables for specific things and functions to map between values from different measurements scales. We use the base ontology description to provide a very lightweight representation of the basic elements of an experimental design and we use views to instantiate it for specific domains.

FAIRsharing.4e6af5	UKAT	UK Archival Thesaurus	UK Archival Thesaurus (UKAT) is a subject thesaurus created for the archive sector in the United Kingdom. It is a controlled vocabulary that archives can use when indexing their collections and catalogues. It is intended to improve access to archives by subject, ensure that users of archives can carry out effective subject searches of archives across the UK, and promote the involvement in archives by groups which are under-represented among archive users by providing subject terms which reflect their histories and experiences. UKAT is based on the structure of the UNESCO Thesaurus, and covers education, science, culture, social/human sciences, information, communication, politics, law and economics. UNESCO was used as the basis for UKAT because a number of archives and archive projects, including The Archives Hub, had adopted it for indexing purposes. However, UNESCO sometimes lacks the depth of detailed terminology required by UK archives. UKAT therefore incorporates terms that UK repositories and projects have contributed, or have been sourced from other schemes such as Library of Congress Subject Headings and the British Education Thesaurus. Particular emphasis has been given to incorporating terms reflecting the histories and experiences of groups that are under-represented among archive users. This aims to encourage participation in archival heritage, in line with national priorities for the sector.

FAIRsharing.4ghkfj	LCGFT	Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms for Library and Archival Materials	"The Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms for Library and Archival Materials (LCGFT) is a thesaurus that describes what a work is versus what it is about. For instance, the subject heading Horror films, with appropriate subdivisions, would be assigned to a book about horror films. A cataloger assigning headings to the movie The Texas Chainsaw Massacre would also use Horror films, but it would be a genre/form term since the movie is a horror film, not a movie about horror films. The thesaurus combines both genres and forms. Form is defined as a characteristic of works with a particular format and/or purpose. A ""short"" is a particular form, for example, as is ""animation."" Genre refers to categories of works that are characterized by similar plots, themes, settings, situations, and characters."

FAIRsharing.6ehjqt	MATRROCK	Material Rock	This resource is no longer available because its underlying source material does not exist.
FAIRsharing.6gs502	STUFF	Stuff Ontology	Multiple domain ontologies have various representations of types of stuff--also called matter, mass, or substance--such as milk, alcohol, and mud. This is modelled in a range of different ways that are not quite compatible with each other as they do not adhere to a single structured approach, at times not even within an ontology itself. The Stuff Ontology is a 'bridging' core ontology describing categories of stuff and formalised in OWL for purposes of implementability. It stands on its own, but there are also versions that link to the DOLCE and BFO foundational ontologies, and one with examples to illustrate classification of stuffs (among others, mayonnaise and gold). This then also resolves the main type of interoperability issues with stuffs in domain ontologies, thereby also contributing to better ontology quality.
FAIRsharing.6mck	CHEAR	Children's Health Exposure Analysis Resource	Children's health and wellbeing are influenced by interactions between environmental and genetic factors. NIEHS is establishing an infrastructure, the Children's Health Exposure Analysis Resource (CHEAR), to provide the extramural research community access to laboratory and data analyses that add or expand the inclusion of environmental exposures in children's health research. The goal of CHEAR is to provide tools so researchers can assess the full range of environmental exposures which may affect children's health. We anticipate that CHEAR will be used by children's health researchers conducting epidemiological or clinical studies that currently have limited consideration of environmental exposures, or those who have collected exposure data but seek more extensive analyses.
FAIRsharing.6mmbzs	PLIO	Protein-ligand interaction ontology	The protein--ligand interaction ontology (PLIO) was developed around three main concepts, namely target, ligand and interaction, and was enriched by adding synonyms, useful annotations and references. PLIO represents knowledge about the interaction of proteins and ligands (including drugs) and has a different scope and conceptual resolution than, for example, the molecular interaction ontology. An important feature of PLIO is that it links directly from an ontology framework describing protein–ligand interactions to the mathematical formulas relevant for the computation of some of the entities represented in the ontology.

FAIRsharing.7e4ddf		OrgReg Identifier	OrgReg, short for 'Organizational Register', is a central infrastructure within the Research Infrastructure for Science and Innovation Studies (RISIS). Its primary role is to establish a comprehensive and distinctive list of organizations involved in the research and higher education system, including higher education institutions, public research organizations, research hospitals, public administration entities, and private non-profit organizations. By assigning a unique identifier to each organization based on its organizational identity, the register enables temporal tracking and consistent identification, promoting interoperability with other datasets within RISIS and links with external data sources on the Internet. Additionally, OrgReg integrates indicators of research output through its connection with the KNOWMAK database, providing a regional perspective through EUROSTAT's NUTS classification. These identifiers are meant to uniquely identify organizations included in the register across time. This also implies that, when an organization ceases to exist, the corresponding code is not reassigned. ID will have the following format: ISO-Country code + 4 digits numeric (e.g. FR0001). A specific code INT is included to track supranational organizations, including international organizations based on treaties, CERN (PRO) or the UN system agencies, as well as those organizations which are directly part of the European Union structure, like the Joint Research Center or the European Research Council.

FAIRsharing.an9ct0	DIAB	BioMedBridges Diabetes Ontology	The BioMedBridges diabetes-specific ontology enables users to integrate data resources related to prediabetes, diabetes, and late consequences/complications of diabetes. Data integration between mouse disease models and human studies is hindered by fundamental differences in the ontologies used by the respective communities to describe the same phenotypes. Common standards and ontologies to bridge the phenotype gap between mouse and human open extensive mouse phenotype data to clinical researchers.  To develop a comprehensive set of terms to describe Type 2 diabetes and obesity phenotypes in mouse and human, Type 2 Diabetes-related phenotypes were mined from the literature for use as new phenotype terms. Expert clinicians/diabetologists then curated the mined terms and categorised them by temporal disease stages. The ontology was then used for the annotation of mouse and human datasets with specific terminology representing Type 2 Diabetes progression, which will ultimately support translational research.

SVL can be manually or automatically populated with concepts from a wide range of fields to create custom variables. Originally, SVO was created to express the set of CSDMS standard names in ontology form. The current ontology is designed to be terminology agnostic and can be augmented to include an unlimited number of synonymous terms. SVO is designed to balance a linguistic model of the world with a scientific model. SVO attempts to provide a template for retrieving information about a variable from free-form text. One of the primary goals of SVO is to work towards automated ontology generation of scientific variables following ideas laid out in an upper ontology of higher level concepts.
FAIRsharing.ech3sa	ISO639-2:1998	ISO 639-2: Codes for the Representation of Names of Languages Part 2: Alpha-3 Code	ISO 639-2:1998 provides two sets of three-letter alphabetic codes for the representation of names of languages, one for terminology applications and the other for bibliographic applications. The code sets are the same except for twenty-five languages that have variant language codes because of the criteria used for formulating them. The language codes were devised originally for use by libraries, information services, and publishers to indicate language in the exchange of information, especially in computerized systems. ISO 639-2 represents all languages contained in ISO 639-1 and in addition any other language as well as language groups as they may be coded for special purposes when more specificity in coding is needed. The languages listed in ISO 639-1 are a subset of the languages listed in ISO 639-2; every language code in the two-letter code set has a corresponding language code in the alpha-3 list, but not necessarily vice versa.

Potentially, the standard can be used not only for non-human genomic samples but also human samples. It builds upon existing standards commonly used within the communities extending them with the capability to exchange data on tissue, environmental and DNA sample as well as sequences. The GGBN Data Standard is intended to be used with ABCD or Darwin Core and is not a stand-alone solution. It is intended to replace the DNA extension for Access to Biological Collection Data (ABCDDNA), however that specification has not been formally deprecated.
FAIRsharing.emw6am		OntoNeuroLOG	The NeuroLOG project (now completed) developed a distributed platform to support multi-centric studies in neurosciences.

FAIRsharing.f8cd83	CF Standard Names	Climate and Forecast Standard Names Parameter Vocabulary	The Climate and Forecast Standard Names Parameter Vocabulary (CF Standard Names) is intended for use with climate and forecast data in the atmosphere, surface and ocean domains. The CF Standard Names are the list of standard names used by the CF conventions. The list includes the units recommended for each standard name (most common prefixes can be used with the units, e.g. kilo (k), hecto (h), Mega (M), etc). If a standard_name metadata attribute is associated with a data variable, its value must be chosen from the list published in the standard name table. It is not compulsory within the CF conventions to assign a standard name to a data variable, but including one helps data users to understand the contents of a netCDF file. A CF standard name is not a netCDF variable name, but instead a value for the standard_name variable attribute. A standard_name attribute identifies the physical quantity of a variable.

It has been designed to mesh with the mouse anatomy (EMAP ontology) and incorporates each Carnegie stage of development (CS1-20). This abstract version of the human developmental anatomy ontology compresses all the tissues present over Carnegie stages 1-20 into a single hierarchy. The heart, for example, is present from Carnegie Stage 9 onwards and is thus represented by 12 EHDA IDs (one for each stage). In the abstract mouse, it has a single ID so that the abstract term given as just heart really means heart (CS 9-20). This ontology was made computationally and later deemed ""incoherent"" by the authors because the stage-dependent hierarchical structures were not integrated."

This ontology is created with the mindset of categorizing fish automatically based on the attributes and terms mined from the fish specimen. Most of the basic organization from this ontology follows Nelson's research due to its synthetic and broad approach, while recognizing that Nelson's conclusions are one of many alternative interpretations of the literature, which is mostly agreed by our main references, and many fish and fisheries researchers. Most of the classification used in this ontology is in no means completed and just following the recent classification provided by the books For now our work focused more on two group of fish which is early jawless fish, and advanced jawed fishes. The classification from both of this group are structured following the reference."

FAIRsharing.j2np9m	TOP-MENELAS	Menelas Project Top-Level Ontology	The two main goals MENELAS contributes to are to (i) Provide better account of and better access to medical information through natural languages in order to help physicians in their daily practice, and to (ii) Enhance European cooperation by multilingual access to standardised medical nomenclatures. The major achievements of MENELAS are the realisation of its two functional systems: (i) The Document Indexing System encodes free text PDSs into both an internal representation (a set of Conceptual Graphs) and international nomenclature codes (ICD-9-CM). Instances of the Document Indexing System have been realised for French, English and Dutch ; (ii) The Consultation System allows users to access the information contained in PDSs previously indexed by the Document Indexing System. The test domain for the project was coronary diseases. The existing prototype shows promising results for information retrieval from natural language PDSs and for automatically encoding PDSs into an existing classification such as ICD-9-CM. A set of components, tools, knowledge bases and methods has also been produced by the project. These include language-independent ontology and models for the domain of coronary diseases; conceptual description of the relevant ICD-9-CM codes. This ontology includes a top-ontology, a top-domain ontology and a domain ontology (Coronay diseases surgery). The menelas-top ontology here is the part of the whole ontology without any reference to medical domain.

FAIRsharing.lWbenx	RefMet	Reference list of Metabolite names	"RefMet provides a standardized reference nomenclature for both discrete metabolite structures and metabolite species identified by spectroscopic techniques in metabolomics experiments. This is an essential prerequisite for the ability to compare and contrast metabolite data across different experiments and studies. Over 200,000 names from a set of over 1,100 MS and NMR studies on the Metabolomics Workbench has been used to generate a highly curated analytical chemistry-centric list of common names for metabolite structures and isobaric species. Additionally, the vast majority of these names have been linked to a metabolite classification system using a combination of LIPID MAPS and ClassyFire classification methods. A name-conversion user interface is provided where users can submit a list of metabolite names and map them to the corresponding RefMet names. New metabolites are constantly being added to RefMet, however very new metabolite names generated by metabolomics experiments may not currently map to RefMet identifiers. Nevertheless, RefMet has the ability to greatly increase the data-sharing potential of metabolomics experiments and facilitate ""meta-analysis"" and systems biology objectives for the majority of commonly encountered metabolite species."

FAIRsharing.t955dp	CTV3	Read Codes Clinical Terms Version 3	Read Codes are a coded thesaurus of clinical terms. They have been used in the NHS since 1985. There are two versions: version 2 (v2) and version 3 (CTV3 or v3). Both versions provide a standard vocabulary for clinicians to record patient findings and procedures, in health and social care IT systems across primary and secondary care. The Read Codes were developed in 1985 by Dr. James Read. The U.K. National Health Service Centre for Coding and Classification (NHS CCC) acquired and now maintains the Read Codes. Read Codes contain hundreds of thousands of terms, synonyms, and abbreviations covering all aspects of patient care including signs and symptoms, treatments and therapies, investigations, occupations, diagnoses, and drugs and appliances. Read Codes are used by healthcare professionals in computerized information systems. Read Codes are now known as Clinical Terms. Clinical Terms Version 3 (CTV3) has been merged with the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine – Reference Terminology (SNOMED RT), resulting in the creation of SNOMED – Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). PLEASE NOTE: the retirement of Read v2 and v3 (CTV3) clinical terminologies has been scheduled. The last release of Read v2 was April 2016, with CTV3 due to be retired after the April 2018 release. Organisations should be well underway with their preparations to ensure they can use the dictionary of medicines and devices (dm+d) for medicines and SNOMED CT for clinical content. SNOMED CT is adopted across primary care and the wider NHS.
FAIRsharing.tb6w4b	CPO	Cell Phenotype Ontology	The CPO is an ontology of morphological and physiological phenotypic characteristics of cells, cell components and cellular processes.

FAIRsharing.tghhc4	PP	Pipeline Patterns Ontology	To answer the need for a workflow representing a sequence of data transformations, a high-level process ontology was defined, denoted Pipeline Patterns (PP) ontology. Every concept is generically a Data (class from EDAM), which can be further specified as an Entry (P:00002) or an Exit (P:00009). All Entries can be subjected to an Operation (class from EDAM) producing an Intermediate (P:00010). An Intermediate has a TemporalEntity associated to represent its time of creation. Some Entries are specifically of the type Exit, meaning that they will represent concepts that exit the current category and be passed to the next one on the workflow. Additionally, in order to permit the treatment of a set of objects as a single entity, this high-level ontology considers the concept of List (P:00004) and more specifically an Aggregate (P:00005), containing a set of Data or Entry, respectively. The concept Intermediate is an Entry, allowing for the successive application of an operation to an Element. This is particularly useful in the case of the application of sequential set of operations.
FAIRsharing.th72sy	CO_121	IBP Wheat Plant Anatomy and Development Ontology	The IBP Wheat Plant Anatomy and Development Ontology defines growth stages of wheat and is part of the Crop Ontology (CO) project.

FAIRsharing.wgfrmg	CO	Crop Ontology	Created in 2008 by the CGIAR, the Crop Ontology (CO; http://www.cropontology.org) is an essential source of traits and variables to support the standardization of the breeding databases such as the Integrated Breeding Platform’s BMS (IBP; https://www.integratedbreeding.net/) and the Boyce Thompson Institute’s Breedbase (https://breedbase.org/) (Arnaud et al., 2020). By providing descriptions of agronomic, morphological, physiological, quality, and stress traits along with their definitions and relationships, also including a standard nomenclature for composing the variables, the CO enables digital capture and aggregation of crop trait data, as well as comparison across projects and locations (Shrestha et al, 2012). The crop ontologies follow a conceptual model that defines a phenotypic variable as a combination of a trait, a method and a scale. This model aims at supporting the creation and management of breeders’ field books and the generation of annotated trial data. Annotated data are interpretable, interoperable and reusable. The development of a crop-specific ontology is a community-driven effort which is usually coordinated by a curator (or curators) nominated from within the community itself. CO’s Traits that are properly described following the guidelines are progressively mapped to the Planteome species-neutral Trait Ontology (TO) maintained by Oregon State University.

FAIRsharing.Yvc76F	IGSN (GeoSample)	International GeoSample Number	The IGSN is a globally unique persistent identifier for physical specimens. The IGSN registration service will facilitate the discovery, access, and sharing of samples, ensure preservation and access of sample data, aid identification of samples in the literature, and advance the exchange of digital sample data among interoperable data systems.
FAIRsharing.z2cz7s	MOOCULADO	Molgula oculata Anatomy and Development Ontology	The first ontology describing the anatomy and the development of Molgula oculata.
FAIRsharing.z8nb52	LEGALAPA	legalapa	Record does not exist anymore: legalapa. The record with identifier content 10.25504/FAIRsharing.z8nb52 was invalid.
FAIRsharing.zbff4z	GRO	Gene Regulation Ontology	The Gene Regulation Ontology (GRO) is a conceptual model for the domain of gene regulation. It covers processes that are linked to the regulation of gene expression as well as physical entities that are involved in these processes (such as genes and transcription factors) in terms of ontology classes and semantic relations between classes.
FAIRsharing.zc2tfa	IFAR	Fanconi Anemia Ontology	An application ontology devoted to the standardized recording of data related to Fanconi Anemia (FA). This ontology was created using an OWL file provided by Dr. Ada Hamish (and Francois Schiettecatte) at the Centers for Mendelian Genetics, with their permission. Their original ontology can be found at: http://phenodb.net/help/features. Modifications were made using HPO, OMIM, NCI, and SNOMED. Novel classes pertaining to FA were added and defined as appropriate.
FAIRsharing.zcfp65	BRO	Biomedical Resource Ontology	Biomedical Resource Ontology (BRO) enables semantic annotation and discovery of biomedical resources. The biomedical research community relies on a diverse set of resources, both within their own institutions and at other research centers. Without effective means to locate and query these resources, it is challenging, if not impossible, for investigators to be aware of the myriad resources available, or to effectively perform resource discovery when the need arises.
FAIRsharing.zkdn1d	CO_020	Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)-IPGRI-Bioversity Multi-Crop Passport Descriptor	The FAO/IPGRI Multi-Crop Passport Descriptor is part of the Crop Ontology (CO) project. The ontology has been adapted from the December 2015 version of the FAO/Bioversity Multi-Crop Passport Descriptors. Reference Plant Ontologies are being developed in the context of the Planteome project and are being integrated with the Crop Ontology, which provides harmonized breeders’ trait names, measurement methods, scales and standard variables for many crops. This ontology is one of these reference plant ontologies integrated within the Crop Ontology. This ontology is currently unavailable from the Crop Ontology site, and therefore has been marked as uncertain. Please get in touch with us if you have information on this resource.
FAIRsharing.ZkwSlo	AHOL	Animal Health Ontology for Livestock	The AHOL ontology (Animal Health Ontology for Livestock) was built collaboratively within a network of experts in the livestock health field, in order to describe production diseases. Its structure is based on the type of disease: communicable, non communicable, genetic, metabolic, physical or psychological. The properties of each disease are related to associated symptoms (the expression of a phenotypical character), the affected organism (livestock, poultry, mammals, fishes) or the one causing the disease (virus, bacteria, fungus, parasite).
FAIRsharing.zn05ta	PDON	Parkinson's Disease Ontology	The Parkinson's Disease Ontology (PDO) was created to represent and model the Parkinson's Disease knowledge domain. This ontology with a covers major biomedical concepts from molecular to clinical features of the disease as well as the different views on disease features held by molecular biologists, clinicians and drug developers. This resource has been created for use in the IMI-funded AETIONOMY project (www.aetionomy.org).
FAIRsharing.znrhmd	HFO	Heart Failure Ontology	Heart failure ontology is an attempt to define heart-failure-relevant information including the causes and risk factors, signs and symptoms, diagnostic tests and results, and treatment.
FAIRsharing.zsnv69	MAO	Multiple alignment	MAO is an ontology for multiple alignments of nucleic and protein sequences. MAO is designed to improve interoperation and data sharing between different alignment protocols for the construction of a high quality, reliable multiple alignment in order to facilitate knowledge extraction and the presentation of the most pertinent information to the biologist.
FAIRsharing.zve9cc	PxO	Proteasix Ontology	The Proteasix Ontology (PxO) is an ontology that supports the Proteasix tool; an open-source peptide-centric tool that can be used to predict automatically and in a large-scale fashion in silico the proteases involved in the generation of proteolytic cleavage fragments (peptides). PxO aims to describe the known proteases and their target cleavage sites, to enable the description of proteolytic cleavage fragments as the outputs of observed and predicted proteolysis, and to use knowledge about the function, species and cellular location of a protease and protein substrate to support the prioritisation of proteases in observed and predicted proteolysis. Although the Proteasix project website remains active, download / browse links to the ontology are no longer available and the owners of the resource have not confirmed its current status. Therefore we have marked this resource with an Uncertain status. Please get in touch if you can provide FAIRsharing with up-to-date information regarding this resource.
FAIRsharing.ZZZvAw	VOUnits	Units in the Virtual Observatory	VOUnits is a recommended syntax for writing the string representation of unit labels. In addition, it describes a set of recognised and deprecated units, which is as far as possible consistent with other relevant standards (BIPM, ISO/IEC and the IAU). The intention is that units written to conform to this specification will likely also be parsable by other well-known parsers. To this end, we include machine-readable grammars for other units syntaxes.
