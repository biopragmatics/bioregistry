APTO	Agriculture Product Types Ontology	https://github.com/AlmesCore/APTO/blob/main/README.md	The Agriculture Product Types Ontology (APTO) is an ontology of types, meaning it does not contain individuals and is intended as a classification system for agricultural commodities price index databases in Brazil. This ontology contains labels and comments in both Portuguese and English. There are two main modules: :Organism and :Product_type. The :Organism class contains subclasses that represent the taxonomy of species related to the production of given product types. It imports taxonomic information from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) Backbone Taxonomy via API. The :Product_type class has six main subclasses organized into major groups: :Inorganic_compound :Animal_product :Plant_product :Raw_product :Processed_product :By-product The :Animal_product and :Plant_product classes include subclasses indicating the type of processing the product has undergone. These subclasses are also children of :Raw_product, :Processed_product, and :By-product. Object Properties APTO defines nine object properties: :has_ingredient and :is_ingredient_of (inverse properties): Indicate that a product type is used in the manufacturing of a processed product type (e.g., :Cow_cheese :has_ingredient :Cow_milk). :derives_from and :derives_in (inverse properties, imported from the Relations Ontology (RO)): Indicate that a product type originates from another product type (e.g., :Cocoa_almond :derives_from :Cocoa). :member_of_taxon (imported from the Biological Collections Ontology (BCO)): Indicates that an organismal entity belongs to a taxon (e.g., :Pacu :member_of_taxon :Piaractus_mesopotamicus). :produced_by and :produces (inverse properties, imported from RO): Indicate that an organismal entity produces a given type of product. For example, :Assai :produced_by :Assai_palm, and :Assai_palm :member_of_taxon :Euterpe_oleracea. If only the final product is listed in commodity databases and the rest of the organism holds no commercial value, the product is linked directly to the taxon (e.g., :Pineapple :produced_by :Ananas_comosus). :residue_of: Indicates that a by-product is the residue of manufacturing another product (e.g., :Whey :residue_of :Cheese). :is_a_hybrid_of: Specific to the :Organism subclasses, indicating a hybrid of two species (e.g., :Citrus_aurantium :is_a_hybrid_of ( :Citrus_reticulata and :Citrus_maxima ))., meaning it does not contain individuals and is intended as a classification system for agricultural commodities price index databases in Brazil. This ontology contains labels and comments in both Portuguese and English. There are two main modules: :Organism and :Product_type. The :Organism class contains subclasses that represent the taxonomy of species related to the production of given product types. It imports taxonomic information from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) Backbone Taxonomy via API. The :Product_type class has six main subclasses organized into major groups: :Inorganic_compound :Animal_product :Plant_product :Raw_product :Processed_product :By-product The :Animal_product and :Plant_product classes include subclasses indicating the type of processing the product has undergone.

ASCOPAIN-T	Terminology of French bread descriptors		The AsCoPain-T terminology lists and defines the main quality assessment descriptors used by bread-making professionals and those used in scientific studies. It aims at linking professional and scientific terminologies, as language can vary greatly to denote similar processing operations and observations that are made on the dough and bread. The AsCoPain-T terminology is the result of successive efforts: expert knowledge collected by the INRA AsCoPain project first resulted in the definition of the relations between bread-making control variables and the different states of the dough and bread. These relations were implemented into the expert system used to predict the state of the dough throughout the kneading process. The terminology collected during this work was then published in the form of a glossary in a document referenced by the FAO (see http://prodinra.inra.fr/record/48319). The recent adaptation of its content to the semantic web standards now allows unforeseen uses, in particular by applications. The terminology is available in French. Its translation in English will soon be under way. , La terminologie AsCoPain-T définit les descripteurs qualité utilisés usuellement par les professionnels de la panification et ceux issus des travaux scientifiques. Son objectif est d’établir un lien entre terminologies professionnelles et scientifiques ; le langage employé pour caractériser les mêmes opérations de la transformation et les nécessaires observations de la pâte étant très varié. La terminologie AsCoPain-T est issue d’un travail préalable de recueil de connaissances dans le cadre du projet INRA AsCoPain qui a permis d’intégrer les relations entre des variables de contrôle du procédé de panification et des états de la pâte et du pain dans un système expert de prédiction de l’état de la pâte tout au long de l’opération de pétrissage. Ce travail a aussi produit un glossaire terminologique publié dans un document référencé par la FAO (voir http://prodinra.inra.fr/record/48319). L’adaptation de son contenu aux standards du web sémantique permet d’envisager de nouveaux usages de la terminologie, notamment son utilisation par des programmes informatiques. La terminologie est disponible en français et une version en anglais est en projet.

This ontology is created with the mindset of categorizing fish automatically based on the attributes and terms mined from the fish specimen. Most of the basic organization from this ontology follows Nelson's research due to its synthetic and broad approach, while recognizing that Nelson's conclusions are one of many alternative interpretations of the literature, which is mostly agreed by our main references, and many fish and fisheries researchers. Most of the classification used in this ontology is in no means completed and just following the recent classification provided by the books For now our work focused more on two group of fish which is early jawless fish, and advanced jawed fishes. The classification from both of this group are structured following the reference."

GACS	Global Agricultural Concept Scheme	http://agrisemantics.org/gacs/	The Global Agricultural Concept Scheme (GACS) is a hub for concepts related to agriculture, in multiple languages, for use in Linked Data. The idea for GACS emerged out of discussions at the World Congress of IAALD, the International Association of Agricultural Information Specialists, in July 2013. The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), CAB International (CABI), and the National Agricultural Library of the USA (NAL) agreed in October 2013 to explore the feasibility of developing a shared concept scheme by integrating their three thesauri: the AGROVOC Concept Scheme, the CAB Thesaurus (CABT), and NAL Thesaurus (NALT). In the GACS vision, the integration of these three thesauri is but the first step towards the realization of a hub that links to and from the concept schemes beyond the initial three, and in multiple language areas.

ISO-FOOD	Isotopes for Food Science Ontology		To link and harmonize different knowledge repositories with respect to isotopic data, we propose an ISO-FOOD ontology as a domain ontology for describing isotopic data within Food Science. The ISO-FOOD ontology consists of metadata and provenance data that needs to be stored together with data elements in order to describe isotopic measurements with all necessary information required for future analysis. The new domain has been linked with existing ontologies, such as Units of Measurements Ontology, Food, Nutrient and the Bibliographic Ontology. So linked ontology consists of several superclasses, and for each of these the relevant subclasses, object properties and data properties are defined. To show how such an ontology can be used in practice, it was populated with 20 isotopic measurements of Slovenian food samples. Describing data in this way offers a powerful technique for organizing and sharing stable isotope data across Food Science.

PEAO	Plant Experimental Assay Ontology	https://bitbucket.org/PlantExpAssay/ontology	The Plant domain has been the subject of several attempts to structure and formally define terms and corresponding relations, such as their anatomical features, developmental stages, and the application of particular experimental procedures to a biological problem. However, a focus on experimental assays in order to describe the whole experimental procedure, to the best of our knowledge, has only been attempted in the context of a very general description based on classical views of the scientific method. In this study, we focus on the development and proposal of an ontology dedicated to the description of these experimental procedures, regardless of the scientific questions that prompted the assays. This ontology includes entities from three distinct realms (biological, physical and data), which include both experimental products, their relations and the protocols describing their manipulation.

SAREF4ENVI	SAREF4ENVI: an extension of SAREF for the environment domain	https://saref.etsi.org/saref4envi/	The present document is the technical specification of SAREF4ENVI, an extension of SAREF [1] for the environment domain. The extension was created in collaboration with domain experts in the field of light pollution currently working in the STARS4ALL European H2020 project (http://www.stars4all.eu/index.php/lpi/). The STARS4ALL project is composed by partners such as Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, ESCP Europe, Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries, Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias, University of Southampton, Europan Crowdfunding Network, and CEFRIEL (Società Consortile a Responsabilita Limitata). SAREF4ENVI has two main aims: on the one hand, to be the basis for enabling the use of SAREF in the environment domain and, on the other hand, to exemplify how to enable interoperability between environmental devices in cooperation. SAREF4ENVI is an OWL-DL ontology that extends SAREF with 32 classes (24 defined in SAREF4ENVI and 7 reused from the time, SAREF and geo ontologies), 24 object properties (22 defined in SAREF4ENVI and 2 reused from the SAREF and geo ontologies), 13 data type properties (9 defined in SAREF4ENVI and 4 reused from the SAREF ontology), and 24 individuals (9 defined in SAREF4ENVI and 12 reused from the OM ontology). SAREF4ENVI focuses on extending SAREF for photometers to solve the lack of interoperability between sensors that can measure and share information about light pollution. Such extension involves the following use cases (more details can be found in ETSI TR 103 411 [i.1]): Use case 1: Monitor light pollution in a city, through the data collected by photometers about the magnitude of the light emitted in a given area. Use case 2: Adjust lampposts light intensity due to high pollution, after identifying the most contaminating lampposts and therefore the areas where more energy is being thrown away. Use case 3: Register a photometer, in which a new collection of photometers is incorporated into an existing sensor network., This ontology extends the SAREF ontology for the environment domain, specifically for the light pollution domain, including concepts like photometers, light, etc.

SFWO	Soil Food Web Ontology		The Soil Food Web Ontology (SFWO) is a OWL ontology which provides a standardised terminology and a logical formalisation of the domain of soil trophic ecology. It proposes a reference vocabulary to describe information about trophic interactions, feeding-related functional traits, and feeding processes of soil biota. By harmonizing the definitions of trophic groups, SFWO provides a common, logically-sound framework for soil-associated consumers classification across taxonomic groups and trophic levels. The Soil Food Web Ontology aims at being a reference ontology for soil trophic ecology, and a resource for ontology-driven applications in the field, including: trophic trait datasets standardization, trophic data integration and knowledge graph construction, automated soil food web reconstruction using OWL reasoning, and trophic information extraction., The Soil Food Web Ontology (SFWO) describes concepts related to the trophic ecology of soil organisms, including diets, food resources, trophic processes, and trophic groups, across taxonomic groups and trophic levels.

SNPO	Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Ontology	https://members.loria.fr/ACoulet/files/snpontology1.6_description.html	SNP-Ontology is a domain ontology that provides a formal representation (OWL-DL) of genomic variations. Despite its name, SNP-Ontology, is not limited to the representation of SNPs but it encompasses genomic variations in a broader meaning. SNP-Ontology is general enough to enable the representation of variations observed in genome of various species. Latest versions of SNP-Ontology include the representation of haplotype and of CNV. The unambiguous representation of genomic variations provided by SNP-Ontology enables to integrate heterogeneous data related to genomic variations. To achieve this goal SNP-Ontology enables (1) to represent one variation in accordance with various ways that exist for describing it, (2) to represent the equivalence between two distinct descriptions of one variation, and (3) to represent correspondence between a genomic variation and its outcome at the transcriptome and proteome levels.
