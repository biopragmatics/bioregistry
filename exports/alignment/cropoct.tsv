CO_369	Sainfoin ontology	http://cropontology.org/term/CO_369:ROOT	This ontology describes a standard trait lexicon used in phenotyping the forage and pulse crop, Sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia), with the intention of increasing trait consistency across different breeding programs. Submitted on behalf of the Sainfoin Consortium on November 3rd, 2022. Version 1.0.
CO_371	Blueberry ontology	http://cropontology.org/term/CO_371:ROOT	Blueberry (Vaccinium) ontology defines crop traits and variables to support the standardization of phenotypic data collection for blueberry breeding programs in the USA. The ontology provides a description of agronomic, biochemical, morphological, phenological, physiological, quality, abiotic and biotic stress traits with their methods and scales used for each trait.
