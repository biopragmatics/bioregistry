ABD	Anthology of Biosurveillance Diseases	http://brd.bsvgateway.org/disease	Our disease ontology provides information on infectious diseases, disease synonyms, transmission pathways, disease agents, affected populations and disease properties. Diseases have been grouped into syndromic disease categories, such that programmers can look through relevant categories, as well as at specific diseases. Organisms, linked to both agents and populations, are structured hierarchically, to provide multiple levels of organism resolution. In addition, both disease transmission and relevant disease properties are available to search. Disease properties include tags like 'notifiable diseases' and 'economic importance' to flag particular disease characteristics that may be of interest, but are not captured elsewhere.

ADMO	Alzheimer Disease Map Ontology		Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiology is still imperfectly understood and current paradigms have not led to curative outcome. Omics technologies offer great promises for improving our understanding and generating new hypotheses. However, integration and interpretation of such data pose major challenges, calling for adequate knowledge models. AlzPathway is a disease map that gives a detailed and broad account of AD pathophysiology. However, AlzPathway lacks formalism, which can lead to ambiguity and misinterpretation. Ontologies are an adequate framework to overcome this limitation, through their axiomatic definitions and logical reasoning prop-erties. We introduce the AD Map Ontology (ADMO), an ontological upper model based on systems biology terms. We then propose to convert AlzPathway into an ontology and to integrate it into ADMO.

AHOL	Animal Health Ontology for Livestock	http://147.99.156.182/ontologies/visualisation/ontologie/	AHOL (Animal Health Ontology for Livestock) is an ontology of characteristics defining health issues of livestock in their environment (EOL) linked to their phenotypes (ATOL). AHOL aims to: - provide a reference ontology of health traits of farm animals for the international scientific and educational - communities, farmers, etc.; - deliver this reference ontology in a language which can be used by computers in order to support database management, semantic analysis and modeling; - represent traits as generic as possible for livestock vertebrates; - make the AHOL ontology as operational as possible and closely related to measurement techniques; - structure the ontology in relation to animal production
AHSO	Animal Health Surveillance Ontology	http://datadrivensurveillance.org/ahso	(Work in progress - please contact ahso@datadrivensurveillance.org before using this ontology) This is an ontology for health surveillance, assuming that surveillance data is recorded at three main levels: SAMPLE data - data about specific collected samples; OBSERVATIONS, which can aggregate several samples; and OBSERVATIONAL CONTEXT, which is the context in which the observations were made (for instance clinical observation, surveillance sampling, etc). HEALTH EVENT is the occurrence in the real World to be modeled. This occurrence is an abstract concept, as it generally cannot be determined what are its boundaries in time, space, or population units. We assume that several OBSERVATIONS are derived from each health event, and recorded in the same or different databases - for instance clinical journal, laboratory database, abattoir. At the same time or not. AHSO attempts to model these time specific observations. The ontology is focused on the modeling of the animal and health information connected to a single observation, made at a specific point on time. All the information recorded is relative to that specific point in time. For instance, an animal belongs to a herd, which belongs to an owner, AT THE TIME OF THE OBSERVATION. We do not attempt to model how that animal changed herds on time. Similarly, we do not model clinical progression. It is up to those using the data to create definitions of when two observations should be connected to the same event.

BAO-GPCR	G Protein-Coupled Receptor BioAssays Ontology	http://www.bioassayontology.org/	The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) ontology (http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao_gpcr) describes pharmacology, biochemistry and physiology of these important and therapeutically promising class of academic and pharmaceutical research targets. Incorporation and comparison of various small molecule screening data sets, such as those deposited in PubChem, ChEMBL, KEGG, PDSP, and/or IUPHAR databases, requires a formalized electronic organization system. In order to bridge the gap between the overflow of HTS data and the bottleneck of integrated analysis tools, herein, we provide the first comprehensive GPCR ontology. The development and utility of GPCR ontology was based on previously developed BioAssay Ontology (BAO). The GPCR ontology contains information about biochemical, pharmacological, and functional properties of individual GPCRs as well as GPCR-selective ligands inclusive of their HTS screening results and other records. This provides the first all-inclusive GPCR ontology with all available data to model the relationship between the GPCR binding sites and their physiologic and pharmacologic role in physiology via small molecule chemical structures. We developed this system using emerging semantic technologies, by leveraging existing and descriptive domain level ontologies.

BIM	Biomedical Image Ontology	https://sites.google.com/site/bimontology/	Biomedical images published within the scientific literature play a central role in reporting and facilitating life science discoveries. Existing ontologies and vocabularies describing biomedical images, particularly sequence images, do not provide sufficient semantic representation for image annotations generated automatically and/or semi-automatically. We present an open ontology for the annotation of biomedical images (BIM) scripted in OWL/RDF. The BIM ontology provides semantic vocabularies to describe the manually curated image annotations as well as annotations generated by online bioinformatics services using content extracted from images by the Semantic Enrichment of Biomedical Images (SEBI) system. The BIM ontology is represented in three parts; (i) image vocabularies - which holds vocabularies for the annotation of an image and/or region of interests (ROI) inside an image, as well as vocabularies to represent the pre and post processing states of an image, (ii) text entities - covers annotations from the text that are associated with an image (e.g. image captions) and provides semantic representation for NLP algorithm outputs, (iii) a provenance model - that contributes towards the maintenance of annotation versioning. To illustrate the BIM ontology’s utility, we provide three annotation cases generated by BIM in conjunction with the SEBI image annotation engine.

BMS-LM	BioMedical Study Lifecycle Management		Biomedical research data reuse and sharing is essential for fostering research progress. To this aim, data producers need to master data management and reporting through standard and rich metadata, as encouraged by open data initiatives such as the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) guidelines. This helps data re-users to understand and reuse the shared data with confidence. Therefore, dedicated frameworks are required. The provenance reporting throughout a biomedical study lifecycle has been proposed as a way to increase confidence in data while reusing it. The Biomedical Study - Lifecycle Management (BMS-LM) data model has implemented provenance and lifecycle traceability for several multimodal-imaging techniques but this is not enough for data understanding while reusing it. Actually, in the large scope of biomedical research, a multitude of metadata sources, also called Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs), are available for data annotation. In addition, data producers uses local terminologies or KOSs, containing vernacular terms for data reporting. The result is a set of heterogeneous KOSs (local and published) with different formats and levels of granularity. To manage the inherent heterogeneity, semantic interoperability is encouraged by the Research Data Management (RDM) community. Ontologies, and more specifically top ontologies such as BFO and DOLCE, make explicit the metadata semantics and enhance semantic interoperability. Based on the BMS-LM data model and the BFO top ontology, the BioMedical Study - Lifecycle Management (BMS-LM) core ontology is proposed together with an associated framework for semantic interoperability between heterogeneous KOSs. It is made of four ontological levels: top/core/domain/local and aims to build bridges between local and published KOSs. In this paper, the conversion of the BMS-LM data model to a core ontology is detailed. The implementation of its semantic interoperability in a specific domain context is explained and illustrated with examples from small animal preclinical research.

BTO_ONTOLOGY	Brain Tumour Ontology	https://github.com/subhashishhh/BTO-Ontology/blob/master/BrainTumour_ontology.owl	The purpose of this work is to develop an ontology-based framework for developing an information retrieval system to cater to specific queries of users. For creating such an ontology, information was obtained from a wide range of information sources involved with brain tumour study and research. The information thus obtained was compiled and analysed to provide a standard, reliable and relevant information base to aid our proposed system. Facet-based methodology has been used for ontology formalization for quite some time. Ontology formalization involves different steps such as identification of the terminology, analysis, synthesis, standardization and ordering. A vast majority of the ontologies being developed nowadays lack flexibility. This becomes a formidable constraint when it comes to interoperability. We found that a facet-based method provides a distinct guideline for the development of a robust and flexible model concerning the domain of brain tumours. Our attempt has been to bridge library and information science and computer science, which itself involved an experimental approach. It was discovered that a faceted approach is really enduring, as it helps in the achievement of properties like navigation, exploration and faceted browsing. Computer-based brain tumour ontology supports the work of researchers towards gathering information on brain tumour research and allows users across the world to intelligently access new scientific information quickly and efficiently.

CODO	CODO: an Ontology for collection and analysis of COviD-19 data	https://github.com/biswanathdutta/CODO	"The initial version, CODO ontology v1.0 to v1.3, encompasses pivotal features such as classes like patients, clinical findings, symptoms, and properties like relationships between patients, travel history, and test results. It facilitates tracking specific pandemic cases, detailing how patients may have been infected, and identifying potential contacts at risk due to their connection with the infected individual. CODO also enables monitoring of clinical tests, travel history, available resources, and actual needs like ICU beds and invasive ventilators. With capabilities for advanced analytics, contact tracing, trend studies, and growth projections based on daily COVID-19 data, CODO supports the organization and representation of COVID-19 data on a daily basis. It allows semantic querying and data retrieval and aids in behavior analysis of the disease and transmission routes. In contrast, Version 1.4, also known as CODO_COVIDRO 1.4 or COVID-19 Drug and Risk Ontology (COViDRO), presents a formal model specifically designed to tackle the multifaceted challenges associated with COVID-19 treatment, risk factors, and drug interactions. The knowledge embedded in the COViDRO model is extracted from diverse medical literature and treatment guidelines provided by reputable organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The model incorporates information on therapeutics, adverse effects, and drug interactions from authoritative medical literature, making a significant contribution to patient care, research, and public health strategies. COViDRO, or COVID-19 Drug and Risk Ontology 1.4, seamlessly integrates into knowledge graph information systems or recommender systems. It assists healthcare professionals in suggesting appropriate treatments by considering a comprehensive set of factors, abbreviated as ""PRADiCT"" (Patient Risk factors, Adverse effects, Drug interaction, Clinical findings, and Treatment procedure). These factors encompass patient risk level, risk factors (such as underlying health conditions, age, immunocompromised state, and occupation), drug interactions, drug adverse effects, clinical findings (including diagnosis, signs, symptoms, and status), and treatment procedures. By offering a standardized framework for organizing and integrating data from diverse sources like clinical trials, medical literature, and real-world patient data, COViDRO enhances informed decision-making, thereby elevating the quality of patient care. It stands as a patient-centric solution, facilitating COVID-19 treatment options and personalized care based on individual patient characteristics. CODO V1.5 extends the previous CODO V1.4 with the focus on COVID-19 Virus Genomics for representation of genomic sequence data. VGO model comprises 261 classes, 55 object properties, and 14 data properties. Designed to streamline the use and dissemination of COVID-19 genomic sequence data, VGO serves as a robust resource for researchers and healthcare professionals. It incorporates data from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), which facilitates efficient querying and visualization of genomic data, thereby improving both accessibility and usability. VGO includes a variety of classes that represent COVID-19-related data such as variants, mutations, amino acids, genes, proteins, genome sequencing, samples, hosts, sampling strategies, and assembly methods. Furthermore, VGO supports automated reasoning, enhancing its functionality for in-depth analysis and interpretation. By integrating GISAID data into the VGO knowledge graph, the model not only enriches its conceptual representation but also optimizes the querying and visualization processes, making genomic data more accessible and usable for the scientific and medical communities."

This ontology is created with the mindset of categorizing fish automatically based on the attributes and terms mined from the fish specimen. Most of the basic organization from this ontology follows Nelson's research due to its synthetic and broad approach, while recognizing that Nelson's conclusions are one of many alternative interpretations of the literature, which is mostly agreed by our main references, and many fish and fisheries researchers. Most of the classification used in this ontology is in no means completed and just following the recent classification provided by the books For now our work focused more on two group of fish which is early jawless fish, and advanced jawed fishes. The classification from both of this group are structured following the reference."

Therefore, this study has been based on the premise that developing an ontology and using it as a component of the search interface in hospital records management systems will lead to more efficient and effective management of health-care. It is proposed here to develop an ontology of the domain of HNS disorders using a standard vocabulary such as MeSH or SNOMED CT. The principal classes of an ontology include facet analysis for arranging concepts based on their common characteristics to build mutually exclusive classes. We combine faceted theory with description logic, which helps us to better query and retrieve data by implementing an ontological model. Protégé 5.2.0 was used as ontology editor. The use of ontologies for domain modelling will be of acute help to doctors for searching patient records. In this paper we show how the faceted approach helps us to build a flexible model and retrieve better information. We use the medical domain as a case study to show examples and implementation.

HOOM	HPO - ORDO Ontological Module	https://www.orphadata.com	Orphanet provides phenotypic annotations of the rare diseases in the Orphanet nomenclature using the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). HOOM is a module that qualifies the annotation between a clinical entity and phenotypic abnormalities according to a frequency and by integrating the notion of diagnostic criterion. In ORDO a clinical entity is either a group of rare disorders, a rare disorder or a subtype of disorder. The phenomes branch of ORDO has been refactored as a logical import of HPO, and the HPO-ORDO phenotype disease-annotations have been provided in a series of triples in OBAN format in which associations, frequency and provenance are modeled. HOOM is provided as an OWL (Ontologies Web Languages) file, using OBAN, the Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO), and HPO ontological models. HOOM provides extra possibilities for researchers, pharmaceutical companies and others wishing to co-analyse rare and common disease phenotype associations, or re-use the integrated ontologies in genomic variants repositories or match-making tools.

HSPO	Health and Social Person-centric Ontology	https://github.com/IBM/hspo-ontology	The HSPO is an ontology that aims to represent and link together information about an individual from multiple domains. This work is motivated by the need to better understand the drivers of health outcomes that may arise from other domains including, but not limited to, the social determinants of health (e.g. ethnicity, transportation, education). This ontology can also describe a group of individuals that share similar characteristics (i.e. a cohort). Through this ontology we attempt to define a number of social contexts or social domains which can be useful to organise information coming from different terminologies such as ICD and SNOMED.

HUPSON	Human Physiology Simulation Ontology	http://www.scai.fraunhofer.de/en/business-research-areas/bioinformatics/downloads.html	Large biomedical simulation initiatives, such as the Virtual Physiological Human (VPH), are substantially dependent on controlled vocabularies to facilitate the exchange of information, of data and of models. Hindering these initiatives is a lack of a comprehensive ontology that covers the essential concepts of the simulation domain. We propose a first version of a newly constructed ontology, HuPSON, as a basis for shared semantics and interoperability of simulations, of models, of algorithms and of other resources in this domain. The ontology is based on the Basic Formal Ontology, and adheres to the MIREOT principles.

I-ADOPT	I-ADOPT Framework Ontology	https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/interoperable-descriptions-observable-property-terminology-wg-i-adopt-wg/wiki/i-adopt-0	The I-ADOPT Framework is an ontology designed to facilitate interoperability between existing variable description models (including ontologies, taxonomy, and structured controlled vocabularies). One of the challenges in representing semantic descriptions of variables is getting people to agree about what they mean when describing the components that define the variables. The I-ADOPT ontology addresses this by providing core components and their relations that can be applied to define machine-interpretable variable descriptions that re-use FAIR vocabulary terms. This first version of the ontology has been developed by a core group of terminology experts and users from the Research Data Alliance (RDA) InteroperAble Descriptions of Observable Property Terminology (I-ADOPT) Working Group.

ICECI	International Classification of External Causes of Injuries		The International Classification of External Causes of Injury (ICECI) is a system of classifications to enable systematic description of how injuries occur. It is designed especially to assist injury prevention. The ICECI was originally designed for use in settings in which information is recorded in a way that allows statistical reporting--for example, injury surveillance based on collection of information about cases attending a sample of hospital emergency departments. It has also been found useful for other purposes. For example, it has been used as a reference classification during revision of another classification, to record risk-factor exposure of children in a cohort study, as the basis for special-purpose classifications and in a growing number of other ways.

IDEM	IDEM: wInD Energy Models Taxonomy	https://github.com/DTUWindEnergy/IDEM-taxonomy	Controlled vocabularies such as taxonomies allow an accurate and controlled approach in describing datasets. One of such controlled vocabulary is Wind Energy Taxonomy of Models. This taxonomy is the result of EERA JP WIND IRPWind Open Data initiative that took place in 2017 in which wind energy experts generated the first version of the taxonomy as an input for defining and structuring wind energy metadata. The report of this work is available at Zenodo: https://www.zenodo.org/record/1199489#.XSD6haeQ3RY In 2018, the taxonomy of topics was improved during the internal project of DTU Wind Energy titled 'FAIR Digitalization': https://www.zenodo.org/record/1493874#.XSD7TaeQ3RY In 2021, the taxonomy was converted into FAIR machine-actionable controlled vocabulary using sheet2rdf. The controlled vocabulary is served to humans and machines using an instace of OntoStack hosted by DTU Wind Energy. sheet2rdf and OntoStack are developed by FAIR Data Collective. Additionally, in 2021, the persistent URL purl.org/idem has been registered for the taxonomy. This allows us to: If there is a needed to move the taxonomy to another domain (currently under data.windenergy.dtu.dk) URLs will be still resolvable and unchanged Use short URls as PIDs for the taxonomy terms and properties.

This ontology was created using an OWL file provided by Dr. Ada Hamish (and Francois Schiettecatte) at the Centers for Mendelian Genetics, with their permission. Their original ontology can be found at: http://phenodb.net/help/features. Modifications were made using HPO, OMIM, NCI, and SNOMED. Novel classes pertaining to FA were added and defined as appropriate.
IGTO	Scientific Evidence Based Genetic Testing Ontology	http://qianzhu-lab.umbc.edu/	The ontology introduced a novel integrative genetic testing resource called Genetic Testing Ontology (GTO). More specifically,GTO integrated multiple well-known genetic testing resources, including Genetic Testing Registry (GTR), ClinVar, and Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) in Web Ontology Language (OWL). A meta-ontology has been designed to capture semantics and associations based on the nature of the selected data via Protégé. The GTO was built on top of the meta-ontology subsequently by populating specific genetic testing data. In addition, literature data from Semantic MEDLINE (SM) has been extracted and integrated in the GTO to provide scientific evidence accordingly.
ILLNESSINJURY	Illness and Injury		"This list of Illness and Injury (Morbidity and Mortality) classifications is an abbreviated version of the World Health Organization's (WHO) Startup Mortality List (ICD-10-SMoL). ICD-10-SMoL is the WHO's application of ICD-10 for low-resource settings initial cause of death collection. ICD-10-SMoL was chosen because it is a simplified version of the ICD-10. ICD (International Classification of Diseases) ""is the foundation for the identification of health trends and statistics globally, and the international standard for reporting diseases and health conditions. It is the diagnostic classification standard for all clinical and research purposes. ICD defines the universe of diseases, disorders, injuries and other related health conditions"" [http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/]. Version 1.0 of this ontology was compiled for the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory (CWRC) ontology project and reflects the need to have causes of death and health issues organized in a way to allow for analysis of cultural data. A simplified list was deemed sufficient since the domain under study (cultural documents) will not have detailed medical information with regards to cause of death or health issues. But instead of accepting a list of general usage terms for causes of death or health issues that appear in some sources (e.g. Wikipedia, Wikidatak, etc.), a standardized, medical classification was selected so that it could be of use for future analysis regarding questions involving the intersection of health and culture. ICD-10-SMoL was chosen since it was the latest version of this list (June, 2018). A stable version of ICD-11 was to be available in June 2018 but there was no ICD-11-SMoL available at this time. To obtain the ICD10-SMoL: http://www.who.int/healthinfo/civil_registration/ICD_10_SMoL.pdf?ua=1"
IMGT-ONTOLOGY	Immunogenetics Ontology	http://www.imgt.org/	"IMGT-ONTOLOGY is the first ontology for immunogenetics and immunoinformatics. It provides a semantic specification of the terms to be used in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics and manages the related knowledge, thus allowing the standardization for immunogenetics data from genome, proteome, genetics, two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) structures. IMGT-ONTOLOGY manages the knowledge through diverse facets relying on seven axioms, ""IDENTIFICATION"", ""CLASSIFICATION"", ""DESCRIPTION"", ""NUMEROTATION"", ""LOCALIZATION"", ""ORIENTATION"" and ""OBTENTION"". These axioms postulate that any object, any process and any relation can be identified, classified, described, numbered, localized and orientated, and the way it is obtained can be characterized. The axioms constitute the Formal IMGT-ONTOLOGY, also designated as IMGT-Kaleidoscope. As the same axioms can be used to generate concepts for multi-scale level approaches, the Formal IMGT-ONTOLOGY represents a paradigm for system biology ontologies, which need to identify, to classify, to describe, to number, to localize and to orientate objects, processes and relations at the molecule, cell, tissue, organ, organism or population levels. IMGT®, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system®, has been built on IMGT-ONTOLOGY. The version 1.0.2 of IMGT-ONTOLOGY includes the concepts of IDENTIFICATION and the concepts of CLASSIFICATION."
IMMDIS	Immune Disorder Ontology		"The Immune Disorder Ontology was generated as part of the Bioinformatics Integration Support Contract (BISC) funded by the Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT) within NIAID. The ontology is based on the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Medical Subject Headings; National Cancer Institute Thesaurus; International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM); ICD-10; and other open source public databases. <br><br> <b>Lineage(s)</b> <br><br> A class may be related to its superclass through a true is_a relationship (e.g., Polymyositis is a Dermatomyositis, which is an Autoimmune_Disease, which is an Immune_Disorder). Based on description logic, a class inherits all the Relationships (Object Properties) and Datatype Properties (if any) assigned to its superclass. In a few occasions, a class may have more than one superclass and belongs to more than one lineage. <br><br> <b>Annotations</b> <br><br> Specific information may be available about a class, including Preferred_Name, DEFINITION, Synonym, etc. The following provides more detail on annotation information presented:<br> DEFINITION: A human-readable definition is provided for each class in the ontology and the displayed format is Owner|Definition (Source).<br> FULL_SYN: Synonym of a class in the ontology with type (PT: preferred term, SY: synonym) and source of this synonym indicated. Synonym|Type of Synonym|Source of Synonym is the format displayed.<br> ICD-10_Code: Code of International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision. ICD-10 is a detailed description of known diseases and injuries. It is published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and is used worldwide for mortality statistics.<br> ICD-9_Code: Code of International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 9th revision.<br> Class Name: Class_Name is used as a unique identifier by Protege-OWL, the environment where this ontology is being developed and therefore has to be OWL-compliant. Class_Name is composed of a string only made of digits, letters, underscores, and hyphens. A Class_Name cannot start with a digit.<br> Preferred_Name: A human-friendly and commonly used name in plain English.<br> Synonym: Synonym of a class in plain English, including those in plural form or British spelling. In contrast to FULL_SYN, no type nor source of synonym is indicated. Synonym is human-friendly and not OWL-compliant. A class may have multiple synonyms.<br> UMLS_CUI: Concept Unique Identifier in Unified Medical Language System that is produced and distributed by NLM. There are three UMLS Knowledge Sources: the Metathesaurus, the Semantic Network, and SPECIALIST Lexicon. The purpose of UMLS is to facilitate the development of computer systems that behave as if they ""understand"" the meaning of the language of biomedicine and health. <br><br> <b>Relationships (Object Properties)</b> <br><br> Relationships are properties by which one class is related to another class in the ontology. For example, ""Population_Group"" (a class) has_susceptibility_to_disease (a relationship) ""Immune_Disorder"" (a class). This box may be empty if no relationship has been used for modeling. <br><br> <b>Datatype Properties</b> <br><br> Datatype Properties are properties by which a class is related to a datatype. This box may be empty if no datatype property has been used for modeling."

INFECTION_TRANS	Infection Transmission Ontology	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UtrechtUniversity/summer-fair/master/src/create_ontology/map_ontology/infection_trans.owl#	The Infection Transmission Ontology is developed in order to make transmission data reusable and interoperable. The ontology captures every step of analysing data from the transmission process, especially for quantification of trans- mission parameters. It is applicable to animal and human (hospital) data from both experimental and observational stud- ies. The lack of a common terminology in the infection transmission experiments leads to repetition of costly experiments. By developing a domain ontology we can reuse and combine the transmission data, which leads to the improvement of an estimation of transmission parameters and prediction of outcomes of yet unobserved situations.

ISO-FOOD	A formal representation of the knowledge within the domain of Isotopes for Food Science	http://cs.ijs.si/repository/ISO-FOOD/ISO-FOOD_Ontology.zip	To link and harmonize different knowledge repositories with respect to isotopic data, we propose an ISO-FOOD ontology as a domain ontology for describing isotopic data within Food Science. The ISO-FOOD ontology consists of metadata and provenance data that needs to be stored together with data elements in order to describe isotopic measurements with all necessary information required for future analysis. The new domain has been linked with existing ontologies, such as Units of Measurements Ontology, Food, Nutrient and the Bibliographic Ontology. So linked ontology consists of several superclasses, and for each of these the relevant subclasses, object properties and data properties are defined. To show how such an ontology can be used in practice, it was populated with 20 isotopic measurements of Slovenian food samples. Describing data in this way offers a powerful technique for organizing and sharing stable isotope data across Food Science.

ISSVA	International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) Ontology	https://www.issva.org	The International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) is a multidisciplinary international society of physicians, scientists, and health care providers united by an interest in vascular anomalies. The Society aims to promote the highest standards of care for patients with vascular anomalies by advancing clinical and scientific knowledge concerning causes, diagnosis and treatment, and by education of physicians, health care providers, patients and the community. The Society encourages the free flow of information between its members and interested groups, through workshop meetings and teaching programs, and by the dissemination of a classification scheme and pertinent scientific data. The updated classification was approved at the May, 2018 General Assembly in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and can be found at https://www.issva.org/classification. What is the ISSVA Ontology? The ISSVA ontology has been created to represent a sharable semantic data model of the ISSVA classification. This ontological representation of the ISSVA classification is machine-readable and facilitates interoperability between systems that capture data about vascular anomalies. It is structured hierarchically and contains all concepts of the ISSVA classification and the relationships between them. The ontology is available in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) format, and can be browsed and downloaded online: https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ISSVA How to Use the ISSVA Ontology? The ISSVA ontology does not substitute the ISSVA classification, instead, it should be used as an additional component to facilitate interoperability. Every concept in the ISSVA ontology has a unique code that should be attached to the corresponding data element. In the context of databases, the ISSVA ontology codes could be added as an extra column to the existing data. Mappings to Other Ontologies? The ISSVA ontology contains machine-readable mappings to equivalent concepts in other ontologies, namely: the Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO), SNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), National Cancer Institute thesaurus (NCIT), and the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). This means that data annotated with codes from the ISSVA ontology are interoperable with data annotated with the aforementioned ontologies, without any extra effort, as long as there exists a mapping between the concepts. Issue Reporting Please contact ISSVA at info@issva.org in case you have any issues and/or feature requests for the ISSVA ontology. The ontology can then be updated accordingly.

MCCL	Cell Line Ontology [by Mahadevan]	http://www.molecularconnections.com	Ontologies provide a common platform of controlled vocabulary for researchers who need to share information across a particular domain, inclusive of machine-interpretable definitions of basic concepts in the domain and relations among them. The need for ontologies that provide a systematic arrangement of available data and allow cross talk across various related domains is gaining momentum. In this backdrop, we have developed a comprehensive ontology on primary and established cell lines-both normal and pathologic. It covers around 400 cell lines. This ontology has been built to include the major domains in the field of biology like anatomy, bio-molecules, chemicals and drugs, pathological conditions and genetic variations around the cell lines. An extensive network of relations has been built across these concepts to enable different combinations of queries. The ontology covers all cell lines from major sources like ATCC, DSMZ, ECACC, ICLC etc. and is built in OWL format.

MERA	Medical Educational Resource Aggregator	https://edu.carre-project.eu	The educational resource ontology is designed in order to provide structure to resources aggregated by the educational resource aggregator. The aim of the educational resource aggregator is to harvest educational resources from 3rd party repositories, present these to the medical expert for annotation and rating, and output the results of the annotation (together with resource metadata) to the CARRE public RDF repository. The main parts of this aggregator are: the Resource Retriever, the Resource Rating, the Resource Metadata Processing, and the User Application. The educational metadata involve the Resource Metadata processing module.This module is a combination of 3 services that collect data per article, making multiple SPARQL requests to enrich the data and finally store it as a unique identified resource into the local datastore. Then data is transformed into RDF triples in order to be inserted to CARRE educational repository. The ontology is developed using the Protégé v5.0 , a free, open-source ontology editor from the Stanford University. The ontology is available on CARRE rdf repository among the other ontologies.

MWLA	Medical Web Lifestyle Aggregator	https://www.carre-project.eu/innovation/web-lifestyle-data-aggregator/	This ontology designed and developed in order to represent the detected intentions from the Web Lifestyle Data Aggregator. In particular, it seeks to represent what is involved in the gathering of data from the web and social lifestyle of user on the Internet. We decided, therefore, to develop the ontology using the Protégé v5.0, a free, open-source ontology editor from the Stanford University. The outcome of Protégé is available on the following URL: http://carre.kmi.open.ac.uk/ontology/lifestyle.owl The presented ontology is generic and can support different type of providers (e.g. web searches, Facebook, Twitter etc.). Additionally, the predefined intentions are also generic supporting the majority of intentions in the Web. In the context of CARRE, we utilize, as a first attempt, the web searches as provider and we only upload the relevant intentions (health and travel) to CARRE in the private RDF repository. A user (representing an individual person whose data is being represented using the terms of this ontology) has connections. A connection represents that a Web Lifestyle Data Aggregator of a particular personal computer of user provides intentions for particulars providers. A connection is therefore associated with a UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) that represents an installation of the aggregator. A provider can be the web searches, Facebook or Twitter. A measurement is associated with a provider and a connection in order to declare the connection (i.e. the Web Lifestyle Data Aggregator of a particular personal computer) from which a measurement came. Every measurement must have a date at which the detected intention was taken, a weight which defines the importance of an intention and of course the detected intention that is only relevant to CARRE.

NERO	Named Entity Recognition Ontology		Named Entity Recognition Ontology (NERO) developed specifically for describing textual entities in biomedical texts, which accounts for diverse levels of ambiguity, bridging the scientific sublanguages of molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, and medicine. The annotation of natural science texts is more challenging than in other domains. Biomedical language is replete with ambiguity distinct from that observed in news articles or informal text online. In biomedical texts, alternative meanings are not always clearly separated. For example, in some biomedical contexts, the words for a named entity may refer to a gene or a protein with nearly equal probability; for example, “a mutant hemoglobin α_2” can refer to either a gene or a protein. If the author meant gene-or-protein A, and we force an annotator to choose either interpretation gene A or protein A, the resulting annotation is of limited utility because the choice between gene and protein is random if the meanings are equally likely based on context. NERO attempts to minimize unwarranted, arbitrary annotative semantic label assignments for textual entities. NERO defines ambiguous concepts, such as GeneOrProtein, which subsumes both Gene and Protein using the following axiom: EquivalentTo: ‘Gene’ or ‘Protein.’ There are no biological entities that are either a gene or a protein, but there are lexical entities that can correspond to either or both of these entities.

PEAO	Plant Experimental Assay Ontology	https://bitbucket.org/PlantExpAssay/ontology	The Plant domain has been the subject of several attempts to structure and formally define terms and corresponding relations, such as their anatomical features, developmental stages, and the application of particular experimental procedures to a biological problem. However, a focus on experimental assays in order to describe the whole experimental procedure, to the best of our knowledge, has only been attempted in the context of a very general description based on classical views of the scientific method. In this study, we focus on the development and proposal of an ontology dedicated to the description of these experimental procedures, regardless of the scientific questions that prompted the assays.

PP	Pipeline Patterns Ontology	https://bitbucket.org/PlantExpAssay/ontology	To answer the need for a workflow representing a sequence of data transformations, a high-level process ontology was defined, denoted Pipeline Patterns (PP) ontology. Every concept is generically a Data (class from EDAM), which can be further specified as an Entry (P:00002) or an Exit (P:00009). All Entries can be subjected to an Operation (class from EDAM) producing an Intermediate (P:00010). An Intermediate has a TemporalEntity associated to represent its time of creation. Some Entries are specifically of the type Exit, meaning that they will represent concepts that exit the current category and be passed to the next one on the workflow. Additionally, in order to permit the treatment of a set of objects as a single entity, this high-level ontology considers the concept of List (P:00004) and more specifically an Aggregate (P:00005), containing a set of Data or Entry, respectively. The concept Intermediate is an Entry, allowing for the successive application of an operation to an Element. This is particularly useful in the case of the application of sequential set of operations.

SATO	SATO (IDEAS expAnded wiTh BCIO): workflow for designers of patient-centered mobile health behaviour change intervention applications		Designing effective theory-driven digital behaviour change interventions (DBCI) is a challenging task. To ease the design process, and assist with knowledge sharing and evaluation of the DBCI, we propose the SATO (IDEASexpAnded wiTh BCIO) design workflow based on the IDEAS (Integrate, Design, Assess, and Share) framework and aligned with the Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology (BCIO). BCIO is a structural representation of the knowledge in behaviour change domain supporting evaluation of behaviour change interventions (BCIs) but it is not straightforward to utilise it during DBCI design. IDEAS (Integrate, Design, Assess, and Share) framework guides multi-disciplinary teams through the mobile health (mHealth) application development life-cycle but it is not aligned with BCIO entities. SATO couples BCIO entities with workflow steps and extends IDEAS Integrate stage with consideration of customisation and personalisation. The SATO ontology provides the extensions of BCIO along with examples of a BCI Scenario of Fatigue Reduction.

We maintain only domain agnostic and commonly occuring subject variables and interventions in SCO, and we have a suite of ontologies (Diseases, Medications, LabResults etc) to encode Diabetes related terminology. We have adopted a bottom-up approach to modeling and we have revised the structure of SCO upon investigation of a few research studies (11 to be precise) from the Pharmacological Interventions (Chapter 8) and Cardiovascular Complications (Chapter 9) of the American Diabetes Association (ADA)’s Standards of Medical Care 2018 CPG. We enable deep drive visualizations driven off queries to knowledge graphs modeled on SCO, to help assist physician visualize the similarity of a patient to a study group, at a quick glance. We welcome contributions and suggestions to extend SCO to represent cohort descriptions of publications targeted to other diseases, and we plan to release set of tools to make this process seamless.
SCO_V1	Sustainability Core Ontology	https://github.com/gioUbbiali/Sustainability-Core-Ontology	The Sustainability Core Ontology (SCO) is a middle-level ontology, covering the terminology related to the three major theoretical challenges of sustainability: 1) the polysemy of the term sustainability, 2) the relationship between sustainability and sustainable development, and 3) the complexity underlying sustainability. SCO is designed to be a pivotal resource for harmonizing and integrating ontologies with regard to sustainability. Currently, SCO employs Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as the upper-level ontology. The effective acronym of this resource is SCO. To avoid confusion with other resources that are already available on this portal and present the same acronym, we included reference to the initial ontology version. Uploads of novel SCO versions will specify reference to new releases.
SCTO	SNOMED CT Standard Ontology Based on the Ontology for General Medical Science		The Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Term Upper-Level Ontology (SCTO) attempts to create a basic OWL 2 ontology for SNOMED CT terminology.

SNPO	Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Ontology	https://members.loria.fr/ACoulet/files/snpontology1.6_description.html	SNP-Ontology is a domain ontology that provides a formal representation (OWL-DL) of genomic variations. Despite its name, SNP-Ontology, is not limited to the representation of SNPs but it encompasses genomic variations in a broader meaning. SNP-Ontology is general enough to enable the representation of variations observed in genome of various species. Latest versions of SNP-Ontology include the representation of haplotype and of CNV. The unambiguous representation of genomic variations provided by SNP-Ontology enables to integrate heterogeneous data related to genomic variations. To achieve this goal SNP-Ontology enables (1) to represent one variation in accordance with various ways that exist for describing it, (2) to represent the equivalence between two distinct descriptions of one variation, and (3) to represent correspondence between a genomic variation and its outcome at the transcriptome and proteome levels.

THREE-ST	3-Step Theory of suicide		This ontology contains classes, sub-classes, and relationships that map onto the 3-Step Theory of suicide (3ST). The classes represent the four factors that make up the central tenets of the theory: 1) psychological pain, 2) hopelessness, 3) connectedness, and 4) capacity for suicide. The instances of each subclass are terms that were found in VA clinical notes and indicate presence or absence of the associated 3ST factor. The terms are intended to be used in an NLP pipeline to extract 3ST information from clinical progress notes. Psychological pain, hopelessness, and capacity for suicide are major risk factors for suicide, whereas connectedness is a protective factor. In brief, the theory holds that suicide only occurs if pain and hopelessness outweigh connectedness and only then if the capacity for suicide is present.

TMA	Tissue Microarray Ontology		Tissue microarrays (TMA) are enormously useful tools for translational research, but incompatibilities in database systems between various researchers and institutions prevent the efficient sharing of data that could help realize their full potential. The Resource Description Framework (RDF) provides a flexible method to represent knowledge in triples, which take the form Subject-Predicate-Object. All data resources are described using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI), which are global in scope. We present an OWL (Web Ontology Language) schema that expands upon the TMA data exchange specification to address this issue and assist in data sharing and integration.

TOP-MENELAS	Menelas Project Top-Level Ontology		The two main goals MENELAS contributes to are to (i) Provide better account of and better access to medical information through natural languages in order to help physicians in their daily practice, and to (ii) Enhance European cooperation by multilingual access to standardised medical nomenclatures. The major achievements of MENELAS are the realisation of its two functional systems: (i) The Document Indexing System encodes free text PDSs into both an internal representation (a set of Conceptual Graphs) and international nomenclature codes (ICD-9-CM). Instances of the Document Indexing System have been realised for French, English and Dutch ; (ii) The Consultation System allows users to access the information contained in PDSs previously indexed by the Document Indexing System. The test domain for the project was coronary diseases. The existing prototype shows promising results for information retrieval from natural language PDSs and for automatically encoding PDSs into an existing classification such as ICD-9-CM. A set of components, tools, knowledge bases and methods has also been produced by the project. These include language-independent ontology and models for the domain of coronary diseases; conceptual description of the relevant ICD-9-CM codes. This ontology includes a top-ontology, a top-domain ontology and a domain ontology (Coronay diseases surgery). The menelas-top ontology here is the part of the whole ontology without any reference to medical domain.

WSIO	Web-Service Interaction Ontology	http://wsio.org	Web Service Interaction Ontology (WSIO) enables automated interaction with more complex Web services that are typical for example within life sciences. WSIO is however independent of the application domain and relevant for both SOAP and REST Web services, and for batch execution engines in general. If the interaction scenario with a Web service is nontrivial (and incorporates session handling), annotation with WSIO concepts will enable automatic generation of client programs, scripts, or interactive applications with a graphical user interface. WSIO also enables automation of different ways of data transfer and data un-/compression or en-/decoding. We strongly discourage providers from developing complex interaction and data-transfer/compression scenarios, however when needed, WSIO may enable smooth automated interaction with them. Future versions will support more interaction scenarios. WSIO aims to serve also as a means to standardise the complex interaction scenarios primarily within both SOAP and REST Web services, and secondarily to apply also to batch execution infrastructure in general.

XREF-FUNDER-REG	CrossRef Funder Registry	https://gitlab.com/crossref/open_funder_registry	"The Funder Registry provides a common taxonomy of international funding body names that funding data participants should use to normalize funder names and IDs for deposit with Crossref. The list can be used to present authors with a pre-populated ""Funder Name"" option at the time of submission, and can also be used to match funder names extracted from papers. The list is available to download as an RDF file, and is freely available under a CC0 license waiver. This information was obtained from a GitLab repository created by Bryan Vickery (see Homepage). The first version downloaded was 1.34."
