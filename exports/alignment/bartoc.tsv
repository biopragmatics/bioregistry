10	Australian Public Affairs Information Service Thesaurus	http://www.nla.gov.au/apais/thesaurus/	The APAIS thesaurus lists the subject terms used to index articles for APAIS: Australian Public Affairs Information Service, a subject guide to literature in the social sciences and humanities. The APAIS thesaurus was introduced in 1978 when APAIS became available as an online database and was first published by the National Library of Australia in 1980 to facilitate online searching. While still primarily used as an indexing tool, the APAIS thesaurus is an essential aid for efficient online searching of the APAIS and Australian Public Affairs - Full Text databases. Besides serving the APAIS clients the published Thesaurus has been adopted in a number of wider projects that require a structured list of Australian subject terms, such as the recommendation for its use for subject indexing when using the Australian Government Locator Service metadata standard.
100	The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Thesaurus	http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/services/thesaurus_access_page.html	The IEEE Thesaurus is a controlled vocabulary of over 9,000 descriptive engineering, technical, and scientific terms as well as IEEE-specific society terms. The thesaurus represents terminology and vocabulary usage drawn from IEEE transactions and journal articles, conference papers, and standards. The vocabulary uses American-based spellings with cross references to British variant spellings. The scope and structure of the IEEE Thesaurus reflect the engineering and scientific disciplines that comprise the societies, councils, and communities of IEEE in addition to the technologies IEEE serves. The IEEE Thesaurus contains controlled vocabulary referred to as descriptors or preferred terms*. These descriptors are considered the preferred terms for index usage. Thesaurus construction is based on the ANSI/NISO Z39.19-2005 standard, Guidelines for the Construction, Format, and Management of Monolingual Controlled Vocabularies. Each descriptor included in the thesaurus represents a single concept or unit of thought. The scope of the descriptors is based on the material as presented in IEEE periodical articles, conference papers, standards, and/or IEEE organizational material. The IEEE Thesaurus is a tool to improve and enhance the indexing and retrieval of articles and other material from IEEE periodicals, conferences, standards, and other publications that are made available on IEEE Xplore. It provides a common and consistent language for authors, researchers and online discovery.
1000	Thesaurus for Gender Studies and Women	http://www.fcc.org.br/conteudosespeciais/tesauro/arquivos/TPEDGESM.pdf	Classification by subject headings, without the proper and constant reevaluations and updates made by experts from each field of study, tends to become a pile of words with little efficacy for the collection, storage and retrieval of documents. In the case of larger libraries, able to update their headline lists, this classification is valid, the library of a research institute with well-designed study programs should support its researchers with indexes based on specific thesauri.  In this sense, the thesaurus for gender studies and women presented below represents the appropriate instrument not only for a more precise indexing of collections on gender and women of any library, but also to facilitate access to information on the feminine condition , Or to expedite bibliographical surveys and possible mapping of gender studies.
1001	European Committee for Homeopathy Homeopathic Thesaurus	http://homeopathyeurope.org/thesaurus/	This controlled thesaurus of keyterms in homeopathy is for use when indexing literature on homeopathy and also when searching databases which have been indexed according to this list of terms. This thesaurus can be used in conjunction with the Amed Thesaurus from the British Library and the MeSH Medical Subject Headings from the National Library of Medicine, USA (used for Medline). It was developed as an addition to the Amed thesaurus to give greater depth of indexing for homeopathy, as there are only a few terms on homeopathy available in Amed. Terms in English have been translated into French, German and Italian to produce this multilingual edition of the thesaurus. However, the main language for this thesaurus remains English.

1005	European Union multilingual Thesaurus	http://www.bizkaia.net/kultura/eurovoc/index.asp	Eurovoc is a multilingual thesaurus. As a thesaurus, it can be used to classify documents according to subject and, more specifically, to organise or classify the document database of the European Union and thus make consulting the database an easier task. Given that Eurovoc is a multilingual thesaurus (it has been translated into all the official languages of the European Union), it allows any user wishing to find a specific document to perform a search in their own language, even if the document is written in another. Furthermore, and considering that equivalences established between the various languages are stable and fixed, Eurovoc can also be considered a multilingual dictionary, thus helping considerably with translations generally as well as terminology standardisation. With the translation of Eurovoc, Basque has now placed itself at the same level as the official languages of the European Union.
1006	The thesaurus of the Parliament of Catalonia	http://www.parlament.cat/web/documentacio/recursos-documentals/tesaurus/index.html	The Eurovoc thesaurus is a multilingual, multidisciplinary prepared by the Parliament and the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities (OPOCE) that covers all areas of activity of the European Union and allows indexed documents that manage institutions Europe in order to facilitate their consultation. (...) in Spain, the thesaurus Eurovoc has been translated into Basque by the Provincial Council of Biscay, and Catalan, by the Parliament of Catalonia. If While the original purpose of the treatment was Eurovoc documentation generated by the Community institutions, the thesaurus is also a tool for multidisciplinary broad enough to cover the different national perspectives, with a very strong accent in all that concerns at parliamentary level. that is why, apart from European institutions such as the Parliament or the Office for Official Publications of the European Union, is also the instrument of falling ripció used by many national parliaments, regional and regional government and some from across the European Union. The international nature of the institution makes obviously Eurovoc thesaurus is multidisciplinary and multilingual, and you try and actually, it aconsegueix- a framework generic description theme in almost all areas, in one way or on the other, are common to any political institution in all its aspects (economic, social, agricultural, audiovisual, etc.). However, the same instrument thematic description can hardly meet the expectations of all international institutions to make use of. There are several factors (social, political, linguistic, geographical, etc.) that make the needs of each institution are different descriptive. Therefore, indexing language should be primarily serving the institution uses so it can meet the specific needs of information retrieval in the same administration and in general for all users. The Parliament of Catalonia, when the thesaurus Eurovoc translated into Catalan, chose to make its own development, with new descriptors and non-descriptors felt that there should be a needs index the institution and the new associative relations or explanatory notes seemed appropriate. Thus, since 2000, the thesaurus Eurovoc own development with the Parliament of Catalonia is the instrument description that is used to index all parliamentary initiatives, which facilitates you can very easily see the entire parliamentary activity that has taken place in the Catalan parliament.
1007	Glossary of the European Higher Education	http://www.upc.edu/slt/glosEEES/menu.php	The Glossary is a collection of the EHEA multilingual Catalan, Spanish, English and French keywords on the European Higher Education explained extensively from the documentation generated by this new reality. The aim of this material is to facilitate the understanding of European higher education and to be a useful resource for the writing and translation of educational documents generated within this framework.
1008	A table of geologic time	http://cit.iec.cat/obresx.asp	This work is a collection of about a thousand words, the result of two centuries of accumulated scientific development. (...)

1011	CMS Ontology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/cms	An ontology to represent the content management systems and their interaction with the triplestore. For instance, how should an entity in the triplestore, e.g., the URI for Manchester United, be linked to an external CMS that provides more information about Manchester United, e.g., sports statistics, or how should a creative work URI in the triplestore refer to the CMS it was created. The CMS ontology provides the Linked Data Platform customers with pointers to additional information about a thing in other systems.
1012	Core Concepts Ontology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/coreconcepts	The generic BBC ontology for people, places,events, organisations, themes which represent things that make sense across the BBC.

1019	Storyline Ontology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/storyline	The News Storyline Ontology is a generic model for describing and organising the stories news organisations tell. The ontology is intended to be flexible to support any given news or media publisher's approach to handling news stories. At the heart of the ontology, is the concept of Storyline. As a nuance of the English language the word 'story' has multiple meanings. In news organisations, a story can be an individual piece of content, such as an article or news report. It can also be the editorial view on events occurring in the world.
102	The Thesaurus Network Computerized access to the Collections of Museums Institutions	http://aicim.be/main/fr/thesaurus.php	The 3 thesauri in free consultation on this site are the result of several years of work and have been specially created to meet the specific needs of the museums members of the AICIM Network, which evolve every day thanks to the additions and suggestions of the museums. Goals are to standardize the vocabulary used in the inventory records and to facilitate the search of objects in the AICIM database.
1020	Wildlife Ontology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/wo	A simple vocabulary for describing biological species and related taxa. The vocabulary defines terms for describing the names and ranking of taxa, as well as providing support for describing their habitats, conservation status, and behavioural characteristics, etc.
1021	Cell Line Ontology	http://www.clo-ontology.org/	Thousands of cell lines have been artificially developed and used for different applications. Information about cell lines is typically stored in public repositories and indexed catalogues. Most cell lines are commercially available. Some cell lines are only transferred between academic laboratories. Information about cell lines has not been well standardized and machine-readable to date. Integration of data from multiple sources is a challenge, confounded by lack of consistent naming conventions, contamination of cell lines, and provision of the same cell lines by multiple commercial sources but with different biological attributes. The Cell Line Ontology (CLO) is a community-based effort to represent all cell lines in a starndard ontology approach.

1024	Cell Cycle Ontology	http://www.cellcycleontology.org/	CCO basically contains genes, proteins, interactions (comprising genes or proteins that participate in them), processes from the cell cycle subtree of GO, molecular functions (GO), taxa, and ontological constructs (like an upper level ontology and relationships) to stick everything together. The knowledge represented in the system is expected to grow in quantity (integrating more data and different resources) and quality (organizing everything with Ontology Design Patterns and new relationships).
1025	Plant Ontology	http://plantontology.org/	Plant Ontology project is a major international bioinformatics effort on standardizing the nomenclature, definitions, synonyms and relations of various terms/keywords/vocabularies that describe anatomical entities as well as the growth and developmental stages of plants. This collaborative project involves team members and projects with expertise on plant functional and comparative genomics, genetics, systematics, anatomy, developmental biology, computational biology, ontology development, etc. By developing the standardized vocabularies and their integration in the annotation of various data sets such as the annotation of plant part and its developmental stage that was used for analyzing the transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, phenotype and gene-gene interaction data sets. The successful integration facilitates users to perform queries on one or more data sets within a database or even between multiple remote database resources.

1030			(...) ICC (.) is based on the premises that whenever information is to be generated or to be presented (in code form) at least two items are necessary one which plays the part of a subject and the other one that of the predicate of a sentence, with both these items being framed into a third one. The first basic division is by the categorial concepts denoting general entities and general aspects/determinations of being, framed into an evolutionary pattern of levels creating the 81 subject groups of ICC. Each of these subject groups is structured by a socalled systematifier, applying a recurring series of facets.
1031	Classification for general libraries	https://asb-kab-online.de/	The classification for general libraries (KAB) is a library classification developed by the Zentralinstitut für Bibliothekswesen (GDR) and is still being used today (in an revised version) in most municipal libraries of the new federal states, according to the General System for Public Libraries (ASB ), As the east-German counterpart, it is the most widely distributed system in public libraries in Germany.

It should be noted here that the alphabet notation of the main series of the librarian-bibliographic classification has been replaced by two-digit numbers, which are deduced from the following digits by a plus sign. Since some 'arrangement overviews' in the librarian-bibliographic classification contain annexes, which partly correspond to groups of the general key, the relevant key groups are used instead of these attachments.
1035	Sears List of Subject Headings	http://support.epnet.com/uploads/kb/sears_19th_edition.pdf	Since the first edition in 1923, the Sears List has served the unique needs of small and medium-sized libraries, suggesting headings appropriate for use in their catalogs and providing patterns and instructions for adding new headings as they are required. The successive editors of the List have faced the need to accommodate change while maintaining a sound continuity. The new and revised headings in each edition reflect developments in the material catalogued and in the use of the English language, aiming always to make library collections as easily available as possible to library users.
1036	Directory of Materials	https://rvmweb.bibl.ulaval.ca/accueil	RVM has been a world leader in controlled French vocabularies for more than 70 years, serving French-language and bilingual libraries in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada. It offers 4 thesauruses with MARC 21- and SKOS-coded data.

1038	Expanded Thesaurus	http://maknaz.org/	The goal behind this project is the development of an extensive Arabic thesaurus that would encompass all fields of knowledge – something that most libraries and information centers in the Arab world lack – to serve as the basic instrument of subjective analysis of information retrieval devices, and to keep abreast with developments taking place in information technology. In mid 1993, an agreement for developing an extensive trilingual (Arabic – English – French) Arab thesaurus was concluded between AHS Foundation, the Dubai Municipality, and Jum’ah Al-Majid Center for Culture and Heritage in Dubai, UAE. By mid 1995, the first paperback edition of the thesaurus was issued, containing some 48,000 terms. The electronic version was issued in mid 2001 on CD, and it contained some 50,000 terms. This version is marked by a set of technical specifications that were specifically added to suit the purposes of this issue of the thesaurus as well as to make search and retrieval easier for persons doing the indexing and cataloging.
1039	Subject headings for children's materials	http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015030782539	Subject cataloging, in principle, is the same in all types of libraries. Variations and adaptions are developed as these principles are applied to special collections or general collections for limited or specific patrons. This list of subject headings is intended for use wherever material for use by children from the elementary through the junior high school level is brought together in the public or school library. Children's interests are universal but their vocabulary is still growing along with their learning processes so subject headings which anticipate their approach to a wide variety of material and which employ terminology with which they are familiar are needed to facilitate their use of the library catalog. However, the language and approach of the children must be captured without completely losing touch with standard cataloging practice so that the mastery of the children's catalog will be a step on the road to the understanding and use of the adult catalog in future years. In compiling this list in accordance with these principles our personal experiences in school and public libraries were an important factor, but personal opinions have been substantiated by considerable study and research including a master's thesis by Eloise Rue, 'Preferences of Elementary Children for Subject Heading Form'; scrutiny of outstanding courses of study for grades one through nine issued since 1944 and an examination of standard tools in use; the results of a questionnaire to school library supervisors, children's departments in public libraries, curriculum specialists, children's catalogers and library school faculties. These formed the basis for original decisions. When the preliminary draft had been completed, consultants throughout the United States and Canada were called upon to examine and comment on it. The present list incorporates many of their suggestions and comments.

1040	United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction Terminology	http://www.unisdr.org/we/inform/terminology	The UNISDR Terminology aims to promote a common understanding and usage of disaster risk reduction concepts and to assist the disaster risk reduction efforts of authorities, practitioners and the public. The previous version 'Terminology: Basic terms of disaster risk reduction' was published in 'Living with risk: a global review of disaster risk reduction initiatives' in 2004. The following year, the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015 requested the UNISDR secretariat to 'update and widely disseminate international standard terminology related to disaster risk reduction, at least in all official United Nations languages, for use in programme and institutions development, operations, research, training curricula and public information programmes'.
1041	Proposed International Standard Nomenclature for Fields of Science and Technology		The Proposed international standard nomenclature for fields of science and technology was proposed in 1973 and 1974 by the Division of Science Policy and Statistics for Science and Technology of UNESCO and adopted by the Scientific Advisory Committee. This is a classification system widely used in knowledge management of research projects and dissertations. Categories are divided into three hierarchical levels: Fields: Refering to general sections. Encoded with two digits and comprises several disciplines. Disciplines: Provide an overview of specialty groups in Science and Technology. Encoded with four digits. Despite being different from each other disciplines with cross references, or within the same field, are considered to have common characteristics. Subdisciplines: Entries are the more specific elements of the nomenclature and represent the activities that take place within a discipline. Encoded with six digits. In turn, must correspond to individual specialties in science and technology.
1042	Field of Science and Technology Classification		"Statistical units in the PNP sector are classified into the six major fields of science and technology suggested in UNESCO’s 'Recommendation Concerning the International Standardisation of Statistics on Science and Technology' (1978). (...) While the major fields of science and technology are clearly defined, the level of disaggregation within each component field is left to each country. (...) The criterion for classification is the major field of science in which most of the R&D activity is undertaken. When a major private NPI has significant R&D activity in more than one field of science, an attempt may be made to split the statistical unit into smaller units and classify them to relevant major fields of science."" (2002) ""The existing FOS classification does not fully reflect changes in the science and technology area, especially with regard to emerging technology fields such as ICT, biotechnology and nanotechnology. This, as well as the need to obtain better coverage of the data based on the FOS, the most appropriate classification for R&D in the public sector, motivated the NESTI Group to review the classification."" (2007)"
1043	Thema subject classification scheme	http://www.editeur.org/151/thema/en/welcome-to-thema/	Thema is intended for use by all parts of the book trade: unlike other book trade subject classifications, it aims to be globally applicable. And in contrast to various library classifications that are used internationally, it is tailored for commercial use within the trade. It is a flexible standard that allows each market to retain its unique cultural voice while still presenting a unified subject hierarchy that rationalises book classification. The goals of Thema are to reduce the duplication of effort required by the many distinct national subject schemes, and to eliminate the need for scheme-to-scheme mapping that inevitably degrades the accuracy of classification, by providing a single scheme for international use. It can be used alongside existing national schemes like BIC, BISAC, WGS or CLIL, and has the potential to eventually replace them (though this is not an immediate goal).
1044	UK Standard Library Categories	http://www.bic.org.uk/51/UK-Standard-Library-Categories/	Note this scheme was originally published as a draft and called e4libraries Subject Category Headings. This scheme was revised by a panel of experts and the new UKSLC scheme is the result of this process. The UKSLC is based on the BIC standard subject categories used in bookshops and by online retailers. The scheme is designed for the public library sector to provide library-oriented category headings applicable across the full range of adult non-fiction, fiction and children's/young adult stock. Many library authorities have adopted categorisation schemes for fiction and non-fiction over the past forty years. The majority of them apply these categories solely at item level to determine shelf display, though a minority also use them to provide a searchable option within the main title-level catalogue record. However, most of these schemes are unique to the authority concerned and rely heavily for their operation on costly and time-consuming staff intervention. Adoption of a scheme of BIC-based standard subject/genre categories, made available to libraries in addition to existing Dewey classifications, offers the opportunity to reduce cost and streamline workflows by automating the categorisation process, and to support further improvements in stock selection, management, discovery and display. (...) At the same time it offers authorities a degree of flexibility in determining item-level shelfmarks, the categories used to organise and display stock in individual locations, allowing them to customise the scheme to meet their specific needs and to integrate it with existing schemes they have already developed. It is very much hoped that UK libraries and their suppliers will adopt UKSLC.
1045	Children's Books Marketing Classifications	http://www.bic.org.uk/8/Children%27s-Books-Marketing-Classifications/	These codes are for marketing purposes only. They do not replace the BIC Subject Categories. Data collection agencies like BML and Nielsen BookScan can use these new codes to provide a breakdown of the different categories of children's books sales through the retail trade, to enable you to measure how different parts of your list are doing relative to each other and the size of your market share.
1046	Product group system	http://www.boersenverein.de/sixcms/media.php/976/wgs2012.pdf	The product group system was developed by the bar retailers and has been used in the book trade since 1997. It has been strongly oriented towards logistical needs The use of the data is decisively changed: The product group system serves as the basis for all statistics on the economic development of individual segments in the book trade. This required a revision of the entire structure of the system. (...) The core of the changes is a change of perspective and the new goal connected with the WGS. The focus is not on more logistics aspects, but on marketing aspects. The goal is to present the market situation of the industry as transparently as possible via the system.
1047	System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe Classification	http://www.opengrey.eu/subjects/	System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe, is your open access to 700.000 bibliographical references of grey literature (paper) produced in Europe and allows you to export records and locate the documents.

The Hornbostel-Sachs system has a hierarchical structure, each category corresponds to a number, with a number being added in each detail step, so that the number of digits increases with increasing concretization Of the number, while further characters (-,:,], +) allow the notation of special meanings.
1049	Classification Scheme for Illinois State Publications	http://hdl.handle.net/2142/3824	The need for a scheme/system to classify state documents has become increasingly apparent as more and more emphasis has been placed on libraries to acquire and service this important body of material. Because of the diversity in library organizational patterns, documents librarians could probably never agree on one system for classifying state documents. However, those libraries which maintain a separate collection of state documents and also a separate federal documents collection classified by the Superintendent of Documents Classification scheme will be interested in the classification scheme for State of Illinois documents used by the Documents Section, Library, University of Illinois at Chicago Circle. By applying similar principles, this scheme is easily adaptable for publications of other states. Although the scheme is now presented in nearly as complete a form as possible, it is still subject to any changes made necessary by Illinois government organizational changes.
105	Powerhouse Museum Object Names Thesaurus	http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/pdf/publications/phm-thesaurus-sept09.pdf	The thesaurus has been developed specifically for our collection. The Powerhouse collection covers a wide variety of subject areas and many different types of objects are included. There are approximately 8,600 terms. But we do not claim to have a comprehensive list of all objects and we are actively seeking contributions to broaden the appeal of the thesaurus. We have recently added a number of new terms at the request of the National Museum of Australia, and we continue to work with them in developing the thesaurus. We are hopeful that with contributions from other institutions we can create an Australian standard for object name terminology. This object name thesaurus provides a standard terminology for naming objects. It does not claim to provide the correct name for an object. It merely provides a name for use in museum cataloguing systems to enable accurate retrieval of information about objects. The hierarchical structure of the thesaurus assists in searching. By organising object names, the relationships between objects can be made explicit. Object names are organised according to their hierarchical, associative or equivalence relationships. The object name thesaurus allows for more than one broader term for each object name. Any term is permitted to have multiple broader terms, for example 'Bubble pipes' has the broader terms of 'Pipes' and 'Toys'. There is no single hierarchy in which an object name is located, enabling it to by found by searchers approaching with different concepts in mind. All terms within the thesaurus are plural. This standard was determined when the thesaurus was first published. The thesaurus attempts to place object names within an Australian context; we therefore commonly use the Macquarie Dictionary as a general guideline when deciding on the preferred or non-preferred spelling for a term. The purpose of the Powerhouse Museum Object Name Thesaurus is to provide object name terms within an Australian context, for indexing museum collections. It also provides a controlled vocabulary that facilitates easier searching of collection databases for specific object types. A secondary purpose of a thesaurus can be to aid in the general understanding of a subject area. A thesaurus can provide a 'semantic map' by showing the inter-relationship between objects and help to provide definitions of terms. This is particularly true for the Powerhouse Museum Object Name Thesaurus which can provide a greater understanding of an object and the relationships between different types of objects.

1053	Andalusian Historical Heritage Thesaurus	http://www.iaph.es/tesauro/init.htm	The Andalusian Historical Heritage Thesaurus (TPHA) is the first integrating experience of all disciplines related to Historical Heritage in a single documentary language.  From the beginning, we opted for an innovative concept of Historical Heritage that understands the patrimonial property in relation to the context in which it is developed and from a polyvalent interpretation of it. In this sense, it is an ambitious and novel instrument that allows the possibility of approaching heritage from different perspectives and allows the description of the same object from different disciplinary perspectives.  In 1995, the Andalusian Institute of Historical Heritage from its Documentation Center, opted for the development of a documentary language capable of facilitating the processing and retrieval of information, as well as the integration of the different heritage databases that make up the System Of Historical Andalusian Heritage Information (SIPHA), resulting in the end of 1998 the publication of the Andalusian Historical Heritage Thesaurus. The Andalusian Historical Heritage Thesaurus has the vocation to be useful to all those institutions and researchers related to the knowledge and systematization of historical heritage information, not only at the regional level but also at the national level, constituting an instrument capable of adapting to the needs Raised from the different patrimonial areas. With the same purpose and objectives, we present the Internet version of the TPHA, which allows the consultation of the Thesaurus through its hierarchical and alphabetical structure, making it accessible to all types of users. From here, we invite its use and enrichment, since we are convinced that the application of the same documentary language in the systematization of the information of the Historical Heritage will have a positive impact on the knowledge and management of the same.

Further, the E&P Thesaurus is a controlled vocabulary for this subject area, in which the various concepts have been linked by means of generic or hierarchical relationships. These relationships may be truly generic or may be associations by use, or even convenience. Synonyms are handled as follows: all terms of like meaning are directed to one term for use as the index term for that particular concept. This selection usually follows popular usage and the patterns set by existing terms in the Thesaurus. The chosen term is called a 'valid' index term; the other like terms are called 'invalid' and are not used for indexing. The E&P Thesaurus terms are interrelated on the concept-oriented (faceted) principle, and all descriptors are narrower terms of one of ten facet headings.

1088	Standard Glossary of Terms used in Software Testing	http://www.istqb.org/downloads/glossary.html	Much time and effort is wasted both within and between industry, commerce, government and professional and academic institutions when ambiguities arise as a result of the inability to differentiate adequately between such terms as ‘statement coverage’ and ‘decision coverage’, ‘test suite’, ‘test specification’ and ‘test plan’, and similar terms which form an interface between various sectors of society. Moreover, the professional or technical use of these terms is often at variance, with differentmeanings attributed to them.  In compiling this glossary, the working group has sought the views and comments of a broad spectrum of opinion in industry, commerce and government bodies and organizations, with the aim of producing an international testing standard that would gain wide acceptance. Total agreement will rarely, if ever, be achieved in compiling a document of this nature. Contributions to this glossary have been received from testing communities from all over the world.
1089	Thesaurus for Soil Invertebrate Trait-based Approaches	http://t-sita.cesab.org/	The T-SITA proposes a non-exhaustive, semantically structured, list of traits and ecological preferences. Terms are organized into a conceptual hierarchical tree with their fathers and sons ('Browse hierarchy' tab). Each term is conceptually included into its father term. For instance, the 'Reproduction type' trait term was included in the father term 'Physiology'. It means that the concept linked to the 'Reproduction type' term is included into the concept linked to the 'Physiology' term. 'Reproduction type' has two son terms: 'Asexual reproduction' and 'Sexual reproduction'. It means that the concepts linked to the 'Asexual reproduction' and 'Sexual reproduction' terms are included into the concept linked to the 'Reproduction type' term. Each term is typified by a unit. Traits and ecological preferences terms are identified by having either a numerical unit or being 'categorical'. Quantitative traits/ecological preferences are informed by numerical values and have therefore a numerical unit. For instance, the unit of the 'body length' trait term is mm. Otherwise, qualitative traits/ecological preferences are informed by textual data. To be usable, they need to be categorized into attributes, e.g. by fuzzy coding procedures (Chevenet et al. 1994). As a consequence, their unit is specified as being 'categorical'. For instance, the unit of the 'habitat' preference term is 'categorical'. 'Habitat' is categorized into several attributes, such as 'Agricultural area' or 'Wetland' terms. Such attributes appear as son terms of the habitat preference in the thesaurus hierarchy. Attributes are identified in the thesaurus by having a unit specified as being an attribute. For instance, the unit of 'Wetland' term is 'attribute'. In addition, a categorical trait or ecological preference can have multi-levels sons. For instance, the habitat preference is the father of 'Agricultural area' which is itself the father of 'Arable land', 'Fallow' and 'Perennial crop'. It was done to take into account the heterogeneous accuracy of the textual literature informing the categorical traits or preferences.
1090	Thesaurus of Sustainability	https://ens.as.uky.edu/thesaurus-sustainability	This Thesaurus is a collection of terms and concepts that survey the broad discourse on sustainability. Most definitions of sustainability, and the various disciplinary attempts to put it into practice, are not well suited in and of themselves for the actual achievement of sustainability. These definitions are descriptive of a future state of sustainability but lack a prescriptive process that presents how the transition from the present state of unsustainability to a future sustainability process may occur. The first section of this Thesaurus presents various attempts at defining sustainability. These abstract definitions have provided just enough information to inspire many different and often times conflicting attempts of reducing the level of unsustainability, which are categorized in the second section of this Thesaurus. Recently, social constructivists have entered the fray and have deemed sustainability 'an essentially contested concept', because of the many diverse approaches to the subject. The third section of this Thesaurus explores this debate and offers a way out of the unworkable conundrum in which social constructivist analysis places sustainability. Finally, the fourth section presents a definition of sustainability that describes an operational process through which sustainability may be achieved in practice. The information in this Thesaurus is no way exhaustive, but it largely represents the major issues and approaches of the sustainability debate. This document seeks to clarify the language surrounding sustainability, place current approaches in what the authors interpret as their proper contexts, and present a process that integrates scientific disciplines and local stakeholder participation into an ongoing balance-seeking process well suited to the achievement of sustainable city-regions. The Thesaurus is organized so that by reading the chapter headings as a first pass the reader will get a sense of the more detailed content within.

1092	Army Medical Library Classification Medicine	https://archive.org/details/101589080.nlm.nih.gov	The Classification covers the field of medicine and its related sciences. With it are used the various schedules of the Library of Congress Classification in order to provide an orderly arrangement for subjects bordering on medicine and for non-medical reference books. The LC schedules are used extensively; for example, social questions relating to the blind and the deaf are classified in HV (Social Sciences). When classification according to the LC schedules is indicated, only the class letters have been furnished in the present index. Specific numbers for LC classes have been omitted on the theory that each library will determine for itself the amount of specificity it desires in its use of the LC Classification tables. At AML, specific subdivisions of more general classes are used only when it appears that the number of titles to be classified will justify their use.
1093	Medical and Health Related Sciences Thesaurus	http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/002507962	The Medical and Health Related Sciences Thesaurus is the list of indexing terms developed and maintained as an integral component of CRISP (Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects), a comprehensive system furnishing scientific data on all research projects supported by the Public Health Services. CRISP is operated by the Research Documentation Section, Statistics and Analysis Branch, Division of Research Grants. The Thesaurus also comprises the vocabulary base for subject headings appearing in the annual Research Awards Index, a product of CRISP also produced by the Section. Documents used as source material for information entering the Thesaurus, CRISP and the Index represent current research projects for FY 1981 covering many widely diversified areas of medicine, dentistry, mental health, and allied public health fields. In order to maintain a vocabulary of terms which is both timely and representative of these changing and expanding research areas, constant revisions are being made. These revisions are reflected in updated editions of the Thesaurus published annually, As in the past, it is hoped that this revised edition will further aid the efforts of research analysts, information specialists, librarians and other individuals who have the responsibility for scientific communication systems.
1094	Austrian system of the scientific branches	https://data.statistik.gv.at/web/meta.jsp?dataset=OGDEXT_KLASSDB_OEFOS2012_1	The Austrian Systematics of the Sciences 2012 (ÖFOS 2012) is the version of the revised International Classification of Fields of Science and Technology (FOS), adapted to the Austrian situation, whose application is binding in international comparison, and particularly within the European statistical system ÖFOS 2012 consists of 6 main groups: natural sciences (1), technical sciences (2), human medicine, health sciences (3), agricultural sciences, veterinary medicine (4), social sciences (5) and the humanities (6) 3-digit groups In order to be able to deal more closely with the national situation in the new Austrian system of scientific branches, these 3-positioners were provided with further subgroups (4-positioners), taking into account the explanations of the international classification Groups, currently no , The 3-positioner has the same designation as the subgroup (4-positioner, e.g. Mathematics: 101 and 1010 respectively).
1095	Application of the International Classification of Diseases to Dentistry and Stomatology	http://extranet.who.int/iris/restricted/bitstream/10665/40919/1/9241544678_eng.pdf	When any substantial volume of data has to be recorded, a coherent system of classifying and coding the data is essential, particularly where electronic or mechanical means of retrieval or analysis are to be used. The Application of the International Classification of Diseases to Dentistry and Stomatology (ICD-DA) is intended to provide a practical and convenient basis for the classification and coding of data by all those working in the field of oral and dental disorders. It is derived directly from the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), and is concerned with all diseases and conditions that occur in, have manifestations in, or are associated with the oral cavity and adjacent structures. For the purposes of ICD-DA, most of the classifications provided by ICD-10 have been subdivided and expanded; however, data from ICD-DA can be reassembled into ICD categories by simple addition. It is strongly recommended that ICD-DA be used with ICD-10 available for reference.
1096	Ovid Nursing Subject Thesaurus	http://ovidsupport.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3590/~/ovid-nursing-subject-thesaurus	Ovid Nursing Subject Thesaurus is a proprietary Controlled Vocabulary and associated Nursing Lexicon which ‘speaks nurse’ to meet the specific needs of nursing professionals of all types and is designed to enhance retrieval of relevant documents for nursing professionals and students. (...) ONST takes the familiar terminology of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) as a starting point. While the thesaurus is MeSH-compatible, many inverted MeSH headings, (e.g. Education, Continuing) have been flipped to direct order (e.g., Continuing Education). This order maps more closely to natural-language forms, thereby making the selection of terms more intuitive for the end-user. (...) The ONST uses the 'flat format' of thesauri, in which all synonyms and relationships are displayed within an alphabetical array of descriptors. Users can easily see broader, narrower, related and ‘used for’ references in a single view, without having to link to other thesaurus displays. The relationship indicators are spelled out, not abbreviated, minimizing the need to consult Help files. This format is the most commonly used thesaurus display format, and is found in the Thesaurus of ERIC Descriptors, and the Thesaurus of Psychological Index Terms. (...) Unlike MeSH, ONST does not include subheadings. This simple structure is easy for the enduser to understand and use. Descriptors can be simply combined at the searching stage, without the need to check complex instructions on subheadings. Work is continuing on ONST, and more terms, definitions, and relationships will be added on an ongoing basis.
1097	SRS Research Information System Thesaurus	http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000008746	The SRS Research Information System Thesaurus was empirically derived from the language of reports of research supported by the Social and Rehabilitation Service, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The subject domain common to SRS researchers came to be described during the course of the thesaurus-­building project as 'the individualized effects of societal dysfunctions and the attempts made to understand and correct them.' To clarify the meaning of societal dysfunctions, they must be seen in perspective with normal societal functions; therefore, the domain of this thesaurus is the total social system, but with emphasis on social dysfunctions. The purpose of this thesaurus is to control the language used to index and retrieve documents of interest to SRS and the personnel it serves. At present the indexing so controlled is the SRS Research Information System Index. Searchers using that document need to be guided by the thesaurus. SRS hopes, however, that the effort expended to study the SRS language and to set it forth, showing interrelationships among terms, will be of use also to those interested in such things as social science language per se, the scope of activities of SRS, and the categories of clients served.
1098	Classification System for Rehabilitation Program Evaluation Technology and Literature	http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED117471	The classification system's purpose is to control the nuances of expression relevant to indexing and retrieving information, technology, and literature of interest to rehabilitation personnel and others concerned with program evaluation. The classification system includes: (1) a hierarchic outline consisting of 323 terms, which provides a systematic set of constructs for describing all the elements (environment, goals, resources, methodology, results, and utilization) that relate to the input, process, and output of program evaluation in the rehabilitation service system; and (2) an alphabetic thesaurus which includes all of the terms contained in the hierarchic outline as well as terms that refer a user to an accepted system term. Both the hierarchic outline and alphabetic thesaurus were developed in a manner that complements the existing Rehabilitation Service Administration's Research Information System Thesaurus.
1099	Instructional Materials Thesaurus for Special Education	http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED101492	The thesaurus delineates the standard terminology used to index and retrieve instructional materials for exceptional children in the Special Education Instructional Materials Center/Regional Media Centers Network. The thesaurus is presented in three formats: an alphabetical listing (word by word rather than letter by letter), a rotated index, and a listing by category. The alphabetical listing of descriptors provides definitions for all terms, and scope notes which indicate the scope or boundaries of the descriptor for selected terms. Numerous cross references are provided. In the rotated index format, all key words excluding prepositions and articles from single and multiword format, each descriptor has been placed in one or more of 19 categorical groupings.

110	The Moving Image Genre-Form Guide	http://www.loc.gov/rr/mopic/miggen.html	While developing terminology for application to the moving image holdings of archives and libraries, the Moving Image Genre-Form Guide follows the traditional methods of film and television scholarship as closely as possible. The vast and steadily growing literature of genre studies has been relied upon: hundreds of books and many more articles authored on genre theory, as well as analyzing specific genres. In addition, the many genre and content lists that archives have developed over the years were examined, along with such other indexing tools as the retrospective indices to the writing on film, the terms in each volume in the American Film Institute Catalog series, and commercial guides to videos. Nonetheless, with the broad range of types of moving image works, there is no single, ready resource to appropriate for a guide to such terms in their archival application. Utilizing this range of previous work, a committee within the Motion Picture/Broadcasting/Recorded Sound Division has compiled a comprehensive, practical guide to moving image genre and form terminology ever created, covering some 150 terms, all fully defined and exemplified. However, in addition to fulfilling the needs of archivists and librarians, a guide to genre-form terms must also satisfy such other interested groups as moving image scholars and filmmakers. In order to be widely comprehensible to researchers, a guide should offer terms and definitions conforming to general classification practice. Since searches of online databases will be increasingly conducted over the internet, instead of with the assistance of reference librarians, the Moving Image Genre-Form Guide aims to promote the likelihood of outside researchers finding the desired bibliographic records through use of the basic terms in the field. With each term, we have provided a definition, describing conventions of story construction, character types, and setting, and, as necessary, additional definitional notes that indicate related or overlapping genres, and other considerations when applying the term. For nearly every genre and form, a variety of examples from different periods and nations are given. The examples are meant to be both typical of the genre as well as to indicate its breath, themes, and significant sub-types. The very comprehensiveness that is the hallmark of the Moving Image Genre-Form Guide will give it additional value beyond those involved in cataloging and inventorying moving image works. The issues encountered in developing such a guide encompass many of the same problems that academia tackles in classes and research. Just as the Moving Image Genre- Form Guide has followed the literature of genre studies, this guide may also be able to make a contribution to such scholarship. Since the archival perspective frequently extends beyond some of the more abstract, theoretical discourse and the possibilities traditionally recognized for critical generic analysis, scholars may benefit from a project that necessarily applies to all forms and periods, with a greater emphasis on marginal genres. The Moving Image Genre-Form Guide may be of value in pinpointing categories that are worthy of further study but have been previously neglected or overlooked, as genres that have not received critical recognition become evident in the cataloging of archival holdings. There are entire undertheorized areas that must be incorporated, such as genres specific to television, from Home shopping to Public access. To facilitate recognition from researchers, we have included categories for some little-known genres that represent significant, unavoidable generic groups of archival holdings. Thus the Moving Image Genre-Form Guide can achieve a positive and exciting exchange between the academic and archival communities, in addition to its practical value as an indexing tool to scholars searching the archives.

1110	A Proposed Taxonomy of Postsecondary Education Subject Matter Areas	http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED125382	The development of the NCHEM taxonomy came about because of a need for standardized and comprehensive structures for cataloging and organizing information on the multitude of instructional programs and activities presently functioning in the various levels and sectors of education. Although considerable effort has gone into the development of the NCHEMS postsecondary education subject matter taxonomy, the final result is not entirely satisfactory. This is due in part to inadequacies in the foundations upon which the proposed taxonomy has been based (that is, two existing taxonomies, both of which have internal inconsistencies) and in part to the restriction of the taxonomy to a four-digit coding structure. This proposed taxonomy has not attempted to resolve these issues but does seek to lay out issues and alternatives for consideration by others who may be concerned with the development of subject matter taxonomies.

Nicknames will appear only under the main entry, and will not have a separate entry traced to the main entry. The Thesaurus is limited to Principal Characters only, as the many minor or supporting characters frequently lacked enough descriptive information to be included in the Thesaurus categories. Occasionally a Principal Character will appear in the Other Character category for a particular novel, but are included in the Thesaurus in their capacity as Principal Characters.
1112	Thesaurus of Development Communication	http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED208834	This controlled vocabulary comprising approximately 1,030 terms commonly used in the field of international development communication was created by the Clearinghouse on Development Communication of the Academy for Educational Development to analyze and index documents. This standard list of terms, designed to provide subject access to information in this area, was constructed by extracting key concepts from relevant documents. The initial list was revised after testing for precision and recall, and reviews by clearinghouse personnel and other subject experts. Arranged in alphabetical order with cross references, the controlled vocabulary has several features. Terms accepted for indexing and searching are printed in upper case letters and are called descriptors; synonyms appear in lower case letters and are not valid descriptors. Symbols appearing under descriptors are used to direct the searcher to a preferred term, clarify meaning, and indicate relationships of terms. Some proper names of countries and international organizations appear in the thesaurus as identifiers, and 'pubtypes' identify types of documents. It is recommended that the most specific terms available to fit the specificity of the document be assigned, and that the real content of the document be indexed. Procedures for updating the thesaurus and thesauri consulted are included.
1113	Taxonomy of Exemplary Secondary School Programs in the State of California	http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED089710	A research project undertook to develop a system whereby information could be exchanged about exemplary secondary school programs within California. A survey was sent to 375 randomly selected districts throughout the State requesting information about model programs dealing with any of the following: curriculum, staffing patterns, office organization, gifted programs, slow learner programs, programs for the emotionally disturbed, individualized learning, advisory committees, career and vocational education, the use of department chairmen, or other innovative programs. The returned data were organized into a taxonomy of educational programs in order to facilitate easy retrieval. The six major categories of 1) alternative education, 2) career-vocational education, 3) curriculum, 4) instructional techniques, 5) management, and 6) special education were developed; subcategories were constructed for each of the foregoing and programs arranged alphabetically in each class. Each of the more than 800 citations in the taxonomy supplies information on the program's title, a description of its features, the district's name, location and chief characteristics, and the person to contact for additional details.

1115	Cancer Biochemistry and Host-Tumor Interactions: A Decimal Classification	http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED070468	This is a hierarchical decimal classification of information related to cancer biochemistry, to host-tumor interactions (including cancer immunology), and to occurrence of cancer in special types of animals and plants. It is a working draft of categories taken from an extensive classification of many fields of biomedical information. Because the classification identifies very small areas of cancer information, it can be used for precise matching of cancer researchers with useful documents or data in information systems, and for detailed analysis of large cancer research programs.
1116	Hierarchical Decimal Classification of Information Related to Cancer Research	http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED025270	The classification may be used (1) to identify cancer research efforts supported by NCI in selected areas of research (at any general or specific level desired), (2) to store information related to cancer research and retrieve this information on request, and (3) to match interests of cancer research scientists against information in published articles so that scientists can receive copies of articles specifically related to their research (Selective Dissemination). The outline of major categories for cancer research information is as follows: 51.1 Selected general topics related to cancer research, 51.2 Clinical aspects of diagnosis and treatment, 51.3 Pre-clinical aspects of diagnosis and treatment, 51.4 Cancer epidemiology, etiology, carcinogeneses, 51.5 Cancer pathology, related physiology, cytology, and tissue culture studies, 51.6 Biochemistry of tumors and tumorbearing hosts, 51.7 Host-tumor interactions, and 51.8 Cancer in specific types of host.
1117	Slide Classification System for the Organization and Automatic Indexing of Interdisciplinary Collections of Slides and Pictures	http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED048879	Almost all disciplines make extensive use of the resources provided by slide libraries and picture collections. Growing demands for pictorial material have stimulated a concern for making slide and picture collections more useful and more usable by better physical arrangement and more thorough indexing. The system provides a classification scheme for the organization of general collections of slides and pictures with a broad subject coverage as opposed to the more typical slide classification system which deals with a single subject field. A suggested method of automatic indexing is included. This document will be useful to builders of general collections, and is published as a tool for libraries and other collectors of slides and pictures who have had no ready-made system of classification available.
1118	Classification Scheme for Career Education Resource Materials	http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED110829	The introductory section of the paper expresses its purpose: to devise a classification scheme for career education resource material, which will be used to develop the USOE Office of Career Education Resource Library and will be disseminated to interested State departments of education and local school districts to assist them in classifying their own career education resource materials. The second section of the paper describes the classification of career education resource material, revised after critiquing by 50 randomly selected career education practitioners. The third section describes the classification scheme, defines the nine cataloging terms used, and lists the 40 key descriptors utilized in the filing system. The classification headings are discussed to eliminate confusion of terms. The fourth section describes the use of the key descriptors and card catalog for the purpose of searching and retrieving needed material, and the storage problem is discussed. Section five explains how the index card is designed for conversion to computer card, and the main advantages of a computer system of retrieval are discussed. Brief descriptions of discipline and content areas, of special groups, and of types of materials are appended, as well as a sample index card.
1119	The Development of a Classification Scheme for Reading Research and Reading Resources	http://eric.ed.gov/	The development of a new scheme for classifying the more than 7,000 documents on reading in the ERIC/CRIER data collection is described. An original scheme, developed in the early days of the clearinghouse, provided a means for listing documents in any of 45 broad subject categories in the field of reading and for identification by grade level. The system was found to be inadequate in that it did not permit sufficient precision for effective retrieval. The newly developed classification scheme proposes 27 classes into which documents can be divided. Each of these uses a numerical schedule which includes subclasses and provides means of adding more as needed. Further classification by grade level, source of material, type of material, and date of publication is also provided through a faceting technique. To facilitate use of the classification scheme, an index was developed which alphabetically lists terms included in the scheme. Testing of the scheme by ERIC/CRIER personnel was carried out on a 200-document sample, and comparisons were made of their notations. Overall agreement of better than a designated standard of 60 percent was determined for 77 percent of the documents, with higher agreement noted in individual parts of the notation. Illustrations of aspects of the scheme are included.
112	Thesaurus for the Designation of Architectural and Structural Works		The thesaurus of the designation develops in a methodical form the 1135 terms useful for the designation of architectural works and the 2529 useful for the designation of the movable works The organization proper to the thesaurus thus makes it possible to situate each term in a hierarchy whose entries Are categorized according to functional categories related to religious, funeral, industrial, etc. It also includes all necessary references, summary definitions, use notes, etc. The American and English equivalents used in the The Art and Architecture Thesaurus and the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England, as well as the Italian translation of the descriptors by the Istituto Centrale per il Catalogo e la Documentazione, pave the way for an international consultation Of data, facilitated by the development of electronic communication networks. These terms allow the indexing of ensembles, buildings and aedicules, analyzed in the French heritage database, the Mérimée national database. As to the terms of the designation of movable works, they allow the indexing of architectural elements, stained-glass windows, furniture, objects, musical instruments, sicnetific instruments, industrial machines and boats analyzed in the database on French heritage, National Palissy.

The keywords were taken into account: rules according to the keyword catalog (RSWK). After that, keywords must also be recorded according to the new spelling. Pre-Combined Keywords * start in the first word with a large initial letter as they present the heading character. Application of the new German spelling in terms of German and foreign language components. Application of professional reference books, generalcyclopedia, Duden dictionary. English terms, which are naturalized in German, are subject to German spelling. For the sake of form, these were written in small letters (except the initial letter in the first word), since a selection according to naturalized and not naturalized terms is too time-consuming. Foreign language composites, which were not to be found in the dictionary, spelling of the German language, not in specialist reference books and not in generalcyclopedia, the hyphenation rules of the corresponding language were applied. For example: information retrieval but: information retrieval system 3.) In order to avoid confusion, ambiguous keywords (homonyms) were provided with corresponding additions. Example: Java «Programming language» 4.) In order to improve the depth of information, many abbreviations were also provided with corresponding additions. For example, ASP Active Server Pages
1138	National Clearinghouse on Aging Thesaurus	http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uiug.30112048976390	The National Clearinghouse on Aging Thesaurus provides a retrieval vocabulary for the document collection currently housed at the Administration on Aging. It also provides, through its structure, a means for adding new terms and new word relationships as new material is acquired.
1139	List of Subject Headings for Small to Medium Sized Law Libraries	http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015033887996	The List itself is not exhaustive, nor is it meant to be. For the subjects represented all practically useful 'see' (x) references and 'see also' (sa) references have been added but not all of them need to be used. However, it seems desirable to make them available particularly for the cataloger whose experience has been somewhat limited. A few international law, comparative law and foreign law subjects have been included because they seem to be needed regardless of the size of the collection. (...) In addition a limited number of non-legal subjects are included not only because of the fairly broad scope of the collection at the Northwestern University Law School but because to an increasing extent legal collections are including materials in related areas. Among such additional headings are the following: Biology, Eugenics, Heredity, Logic, Mathematics, Physics, Thought and thinking, etc.
114	Thesaurus for Graphic Materials	http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/tgm/	The thesaurus includes more than 7,000 subject terms and 650 genre/format terms to index types of photographs, prints, design drawings, ephemera, and other pictures. In 2007, the subject and genre/format vocabularies, previously maintained separately, were merged into a single list and migrated to new software, MultiTes. The Thesaurus for Graphic Materials is a tool for indexing visual materials by subject and by genre/format.
1140	Moys Classification Scheme	http://www.library.uow.edu.au/eresources/UOW026516.html	The Moys Classification Scheme is a system of library classification for legal materials. It was designed by Betty Moys and first published in 1968. It is used primarily in law libraries in many common law jurisdictions such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.
1141	Legal Classification of French-Speaking Switzerland		The documents of the collection of our library are not indexed, but are classified by means of the legal classification of French-speaking Switzerland.

1148	T.M.C. Asser Instituut Classification Scheme	http://www.asser.nl/upload/pil-webroot/documents/cms_pil_2_1_classification.pdf	The T.M.C. Asser Instituut is a foundation (registered on 17 February 1994 with the Chamber of Commerce Haaglanden, The Netherlands, under file number 41158427) with the purpose of performing and maintaining scientific research and education in the areas of international and European law. It is a non-profit organisation, primarily funded by the Dutch Ministry for Education, Culture and Science and administered through the University of Amsterdam. Located in the ‘international zone’ of The Hague – the City of Justice, Peace and Security, the Institute is a unique clustering of knowledge and experience in scholarly research, education and training, knowledge management and dissemination, publishing and academic community organising. The Institute’s international community of scholars is engaged in research, postgraduate training and dissemination of knowledge in furtherance of the purposes and principles of international law. This inter-university Institute cooperates closely with and supports the Dutch universities’ activities in the relevant disciplines and is in turn vastly networked to universities and institutions, governments and NGOs on a global level.
1149	Terminology for Integrated Resources Planning and Management	http://www.iapad.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/landglossary.pdf	To achieve the implementation of land-use planning and land management cooperation among experts from the disciplines involved and integration of the respective results are required in order to identify and evaluate all biophysical, socio-economic and legal attributes of the land. The glossary aims to contribute to the development of a common technical language in land resources planning and management. The terms, methods and concepts used by the different sectors involved should be understood by all partners in an identical way, independent from their backgrounds and professional experiences.
115	Thesaurus Mass Communication	http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0001/000150/015031MB.pdf	The thesaurus comprises two parts. The first arranges the descriptors by subject fields in an introductory general scheme. The second part of the thesaurus contains an alphabetical list of descriptors. The thesaurus is a documentation language devised for the purpose of analysing works, articles, reports and other documents referring to the problems of mass communication according to the particular medium to which they refer: books, the press, records, films, radio or television. While its main purpose is to characterize the information in a sufficiently precise manner to allow post-storage retrieval of the documents containing it, it has the secondary purpose of enabling queries to be expressed in a form which will match the information available. In addition, by providing a valid basis for the exchange of data between documentation systems, it will allow national or international networks to operate in a fully satisfactory consistent manner. In the social sciences and the humanities there are still relatively few fields in which a documentation language has been tried out in a systematic manner. A thesaurus on communication can reasonably be expected to make a contribution to scientific communication, and it would be a pity if full use were not made of the facilities it provides in this regard to both research workers and practicians, in a sector which social changes have brought particularly to the fore.
1150	Landscape Architecture Classification	http://libsysdigi.library.illinois.edu/oca/Books2008-06/landscapearchite00hubb/	This is the first comprehensive classification of the field of Landscape Architecture. It attempts to show in detail both the subjects making up the field, as far as possible in their logical relations and as regarded from various points of view, and also the relation of the field itself to tangent fields. The profession of Landscape Architecture is now so well established, with a background of accomplishment, and public familiarity with the subject and with its literature is now so general, that a classification can be produced with the reasonable certainty that its main divisions will remain permanently useful, and that future developments of the subject can find logical places within the present outline, with changes, if at all, only in some of the minor headings. This classification has been worked out primarily for use with the extensive collections of the Harvard School of Landscape Architecture Library, and has proved increasingly satisfactory through eight years of development and adaptation.
1151	Subject Headings of the Morris Swett Library	http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc	This list of subject headings is used at the Morris Swett Library. It has been compiled by past and present librarians as well as library staffs. Some subject headings have been taken directly from Library of Congress headings. They have been added to and adjusted to meet artillery needs. This product represents a consensus of agreement between artillery specialists and librarians as to the best terminology to use.

England, J. Kuttianimattathil, J. M. Prior et al. Maryknoll, New York, ISPCK/Claretian Publishers/Orbis Books. 1: 541-598.
1153	Low Intensity Conflict Thesaurus		This thesaurus is a presentation of terms to be used for the indexing and retrieval of documents dealing with the subject area of Low Intensity Conflict (LIC). A wide range of documents and reports relevant to LIC were selected, catalogued and indexed from open literature as part of a feasibility study on an Information Analysis Centre (IAC). The Thesaurus of Engineering and Scientific Terms (TEST) was used initially for indexing terms but it became apparent that the subject matter required a broader range of terms in areas not covered comprehensively by TEST. Catalogers added terms as needed and gradually a 'working vocabulary' of something less than one thousand descriptors emerged. This original word list was edited following the rules and conventions adopted for the construction of TEST. Undesirable terms were removed, new ones were added and all hierarchical relationships and cross-references were entered and checked. The present thesaurus contains 950 descriptors and 225 USE references in the Thesaurus of Terms. A more detailed discussion of the process of construction of the LIC Thesaurus (LICT) is available in a separate report. LICT borrows heavily from TEST in format, rules and conventions followed and in many of the descriptors listed. The instructions and explanations about the use of LICT have been patterned after those in TEST.
1154	DTNSRDC Library Subject Thesaurus	http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc	The DTNSRDC Library Subject Thesaurus, which exists both as a printed document and as an on-line computer file, supports the indexing and retrieval functions of the library's automated storage and retrieval system. The hierarchical structure of the vocabulary permits generic retrieval. For example, a search on NAVAL VESSELS will retrieve documents that had been indexed under all naval ship types. Several 'switching' relationships provide an automatic cross-referencing capability.
1155	PCA Cement and Concrete Thesaurus	http://www.cement.org/for-concrete-books-learning/library/pca-cement-and-concrete-thesaurus	The PCA Cement and Concrete Thesaurus, a list of accepted terminology for all aspects of cement and concrete, can now be accessed online. The Thesaurus was first compiled by PCA staff in the 1960s, and revised in 1982. With the introduction of computerized library software in the early 1990s, it became possible to reexamine and update the Thesaurus more efficiently, allowing the addition of hundreds of new terms and other changes as new materials have been cataloged. A thesaurus has a very practical purpose. It ensures that authors of research reports, database compilers, and others use consistent terminology when documenting or indexing the material, so that end users can retrieve needed information more efficiently. (...) The PCA Concrete and Cement Thesaurus, a searchable .pdf, is (and always will be) a 'work in progress', due to the continuous introduction of new materials and technologies.
1156	Thesaurus of Engineering and Scientific Terms	http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc	In the fall of 1965, two large projects were set in motion to develop contemporary thesauri in the fields of engineering and science. One was originated by Engineers Joint Council to revise the first edition of its Thesaurus of Engineering Terms (1964); the other, by the Department of Defense, under the sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research and known as Project LEX, which had as its mission the development of the first Department of Defense technical thesaurus. The large number of related and overlapping interests of these two separate projects soon motivated a merging of the efforts. The need for commonality in information systems and in reduction of communication barriers was also a driving force, as was the economic advantage of pooling resources, especially available technical personnel. Preparation and presentation agreements were readily reached and a joint working arrangement made for the two projects to join forces in one operation. Hence, this single work, Thesaurus of Engineering and Scientific Terms, which is also available on magnetic tape, is a thesaurus for both Engineers Joint Council and the Department of Defense.
1157	Engineering-to-Biology Thesaurus	https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1826/3719/An_Engineering-to-Biology_Thesaurus_To_Promote_Better_Collaboration_Creativity_and_Discovery-2009.pdf;jsessionid=760331A8860BE6FFEBBF58B013EE7836?sequence=4	Biological inspiration for engineering design has occurred through a variety of techniques such as database searches, keyword and antonym searches, knowledge of biology, observations of nature and other 'aha' moments. This research aims to alleviate the knowledge gap problem by providing a link between engineering and biology with a thesaurus. The biologically connotative terms that comprise the thesaurus were collected utilizing an organized verb-noun search; collocated words were extracted from texts based on a functional search word. This thesaurus should enable the engineering and biology communities to better collaborate, create and discover.
1158	Defence Technological and Scientific Thesaurus		DEFTEST now contains 24000 entry terms with 155000 cross references. Approximately 1000 new terms have been added. The meaning or usage of terms and their hierarchies is represented by cross references. The hierarchical display assists in the choice of the most appropriate level of specificity for indexing and retrieval. (...) DEFTEST is not Intended as a comprehensive coverage of the fields of science and technology, but of Defence related topics in those fields, as represented inthe database.
1159	MATRIS Indexing and Retrieval Thesaurus	http://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/oclc/227940825	Categories covered in this hierarchy: Manpower; Recruitment, Selection/Classification/Assignment; Education and Training; Human Resources Management; Organizations; Human Factors Engineering; Information Processing/Cognition; Human Performance; Data Management; Program Management; Defense/Welfare; Personnel; Skills; Task/System Analysis; Quantification/Analysis Techniques; Safety/Environmental Factors; Systems/Equipment; and Media/Documents.

1160	Thesaurus of FAA Descriptors	http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc	This edition, with 3,123 descriptors, includes new terms established since the last publication, in November, 1965. Further, it is presented in the format developed by Project LEX for the Thesaurus of Engineering and Scientific Terms, issued recently by the Department of Defense. The purpose of this thesaurus is to provide a definitive, working vocabulary for the field of civil aviation; its terms or descriptors serve as reference standards for the indexing and retrieval of information. The thesaurus is designed to permit effective specific descriptions of documents on input and answerable search queries on output.
1161	Thesaurus for Pharmacological Literature of the U.S.S.R., East European Communist Countries, and People's Republic of China	http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc	Among the features of this third edition of the thesaurus are: (1) Listing of new or not previously listed pharmaceuticals from the above countries. (2) Listing of new uses for previously identified pharmaceuticals. It should be noted that pharmaceutical usages as indicated in this thesaurus are those indicated in the literature of the countries involved, and do not necessarily coincide with US usage of the same compound. (3) Listing of country of origin of both new and previously identified pharmaceuticals whenever possible. The country of origin of the article in which the compound was mentioned is not presumed to be the country in which the compound is marketed under that name. Therefore, many compounds do not have a country of origin listed. (4) Listing of synonymous names for both new and previously identified pharmaceuticals. In accomplishing this objective two methods have been utilized. In some instances the literature specifically states that two compounds are synonymous. In addition, compounds synonymous to the same compound are considered synonymous to each other. Compounds with the same name but with different chemical formulas are listed as separate pharmaceuticals. (5) Identification of 'drugs of choice' in the USSR.

1163	Glossary of Forest Terminology		This forest terminology largely follows that contained in the British Commonwealth Forest Terminology, or the Forest Terminology of the Society of American Foresters. Where these references have not been in agreement, the definition more suitable to the condition in Ontario has been used. Certain terms in this glossary either are not found in, or are not in agreement with, these texts. Such terms are marked with an asterisk.
1164	Compilation of Forestry Terms and Definitions	http://www.efi.int/files/attachments/publications/ir_06.pdf	The terms and their definitions were collected from publications and by utilising the Internet. Forestry experts were also consulted to provide their input in the case of some of the compiled terms. The terms were taken directly from the identified sources. For some terms more than one source are mentioned. This means that the same definition was found within several literature sources without necessarily indicating the most likely original source of that definition. The listing of several sources referring to the same definition was thought to emphasise that a particular definition is more commonly used in scientific literature.

Together, the private, nonindustrial timberland owners control most of our state's timber resources. You and other timberland owners hold the key to the future of Mississippi's forest economy. As you begin or continue to manage your timber, you will come in contact with foresters who may use terms with which you are unfamiliar. This publication is meant to help you better understand special terms and abbreviations commonly used in forestry. Hopefully, this publication will help you make decisions about the productive management of your timber.
1169	Legal Terms and Concepts for Forest Landowners	http://msucares.com/pubs/publications/p1762.pdf	Greater economic value will result in an increased number of intrusions into forestlands. Those intrusions may take many forms, including trespassing on land and timber, boundary-line disputes, land-title problems, timber-cutting disagreements, contract interpretation problems, and increased litigation. As a forest landowner, you must be aware of the legal aspects of forest management and ownership. This expertise will allow you to better safeguard land and timber. This publication contains selected legal terms and concepts important to forest landowners. A careful study of the information provided will help you deal with the increasing number of possible legal problems associated with land and timber ownership.

1178	Australian Emergency Management Glossary	https://www.em.gov.au/Documents/Manual03-AEMGlossary.PDF	The aim of the Glossary is to provide a list of emergency management terms and definitions. Terms included are those likely to be encountered by emergency management workers. The types of organisations that would find the Glossary of value include: local governments; State and Commonwealth government departments; professional groups; processing, storage and transport industries; other large private sector organisations; hospitals, educational institutions, etc; and community organisations. (...) Confusion in emergency management often arises from a misunderstanding over words because emergency management is at the nexus of many fields. There is also an increasing proliferation and duplication of terms and definitions, as the emergency management field itself is still evolving and adapting itself to new and changing contexts. The Glossary provides information on the range of terms and definitions encountered in emergency management, and may, in the future, lead to a consensus on terms and definitions. This Glossary does not present new or different definitions of terms, but draws together definitions from many existing sources. It also suggests a set of core terms (...).
1179	Brazilian Thesaurus of Information Science	http://www.ibict.br/publicacoes-e-institucionais/tesauro-brasileiro-de-ciencia-da-informacao-1/tesauro-brasileiro-de-ciencia-da-informacao/resolveuid/1c60ede36f47aee60c48957ef6db7510	The recovery of information has been and continues to be a key issue in information science since its emergence as a scientific field to date.With the advances of science and technology and the era of the information society, the Internet and the vertiginous proliferation of information, Thesauri are essential tools in the search and access to information.The consistency, precision and relevance of the information are basic qualities in this process and depend mainly on thesauri. Among the few thesauri of information science in the world, we highlight that of the United States, today's Association for Information Science and Technology - ASIS & T, formerly American Society for Information Science and Technology, ASIS & T Thesaurus of Information Science, Technology and Librarianship, in Third Edition, 2005, edited by Alice Redmond-Neal and Marjorie MK Hlava. The Brazilian Thesaurus of Information Science has a wide application not only for indexers, but also researchers, professors and information professionals in general. It is a fundamental instrument for the consistency of terminology and vocabulary of a given field of knowledge. Ibict owed this work to those who deal with issues of documentary language, since the initiative to build a thesaurus in information science, 1989, was not published, was restricted to internal use and did not continue. A work of this magnitude requires knowledge of the area, experience and arduous theoretical and conceptual effort of many years of dedication. It was left to Lena Vania Ribeiro Pinheiro, a researcher and teacher at Ibict, to meet this challenge, with the collaboration of Helena Dodd Ferrez, principal author of the thesaurus for museum collections. In the elaboration of the thesaurus, the authors had the collaboration of researchers and teachers, as well as information science technicians, with whom they maintained productive dialogues, which contributed a lot to the making of this instrument. Also important were the sources they resorted to, like other thesauri and dictionaries, all identified in this publication. With great pride, Ibict launches this thesaurus, encompassing some 1,800 terms, most with an English and Spanish version, complemented by definitions, in the expectation that the Brazilian Thesaurus of Information Science will play a central role in the information retrieval in Brazil And in Portuguese-speaking countries.
118	The Union List of Artist Names	http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/	"The ULAN is a structured vocabulary currently containing around 293,000 names and other information about artists. Names in ULAN may include given names, pseudonyms, variant spellings, names in multiple languages, and names that have changed over time (e.g., married names). Among these names, one is flagged as the preferred name. Although it is displayed as a list, ULAN is structured as a thesaurus, compliant with ISO and NISO standards for thesaurus construction; it contains hierarchical, equivalence, and associative relationships. The focus of each ULAN record is an artist. Currently there are around 120,000 artists in the ULAN. In the database, each artist record (also called a subject in this manual) is identified by a unique numeric ID. Linked to each artist record are names, related artists, sources for the data, and notes. The temporal coverage of the ULAN ranges from Antiquity to the present and the scope is global. Although originally intended only for use by Getty projects, the broader art information community outside the Getty expressed a need to use ULAN for cataloging and retrieval. The Getty thus distributed ULAN for broader use according to the tenets previously established for the construction and maintenance of the AAT: Its scope includes names needed to catalog and retrieve information about the visual arts and architecture; it is based on terminology that is current, warranted for use by authoritative literary sources, and validated by use in the scholarly art and architectural history community; and it is compiled and edited in response to the needs of the user community. Originally constructed as a simple alphabetized ""union list"" of clustered artist names and biographies, in order to make it consistent with the AAT and TGN, in the late 1990s ULAN was brought into compliance with national and international standards for thesaurus construction. Its scope was broadened to include corporate bodies such as architectural firms and repositories of art, which may have hierarchical levels."

Valid subject headings appear in all CAPITAL letters. Terms appearing in lower case are not valid subject headings and simply refer you to the valid heading.
1181	Thesaurus craft	http://www.physiologus.de/thes/thes-frm.htm	The original thesaurus consisted of an OVERVIEW (only upper terms, = at the same time position of the library, file system), an INDEX (Alphaliste of all slogans) and a SYSTEMATIK (overview with all subdivisions, synonyms, related terms) . For reasons of space, only the main terms, ie the OVERVIEW, are presented here (with their own index); The systematic part contains the actual key words under 'main'. The whole thing was integrated into a full-text database in the form of different word lists (index, synonyms) and also served as a storage and library system.

1185	Classification of Legal Forms of Legal Units	http://en.istat.it/strumenti/definizioni/unita_legali/classformegiuridiche.pdf	The National Statistical Institute has prepared a complete and coherent classification of legal entities by legal form. The aim is to ensure more uniformity of the information contained in administrative data bases and to promote, within the National Statistical System, a Common language between the central and local authorities. The classification is divided into two sections: the first refers to the legal forms governed by private law, the second to the forms governed by public law, for a total of 16 divisions and 62 classes. Each legal form - an individual entrepreneur, a freelance professional, a company of persons or capital, association, foundation, state administration, public body, local authority, etc. - is classified with a four-digit code, where the first digit identifies the section, the second the division and the last two the class. When the division does not articulate into classes, the last two digits are zeros. The legal sources considered for the classification are the Constitution of the Republic, the Civil Code and the special legislation. In addition, in order to capture certain phenomena not attributable to typical legal forms, reference has been made to case law. This classification is updated with the regulations in force on 31 December 2004. It will be revised over time in the event of regulatory changes.
1186	business Rating	http://economia.gencat.cat/ca/70_ambits_actuacio/contractacio_publica/junta_consultiva_de_contractacio_administrativa/classificacio_empresarial/	The business classification is a requirement of capacity and solvency must certify businesses in procedures for the award of certain typical administrative contracts (Article 65 of TRLCSP). The fourth transitional provision of TRLCSP amended by Article 43 of Law 14/2013 of 27 September, supporting entrepreneurs and their internationalization concerning the determination of cases where it is required the classification of companies states that paragraph 1 of article 65, as determined by the contracts for the celebration of which is required prior classification enter into force in accordance with the provisions of the regulations implementing this law which are defined groups, subgroups and categories that classify these agreements and continues in force until then, paragraph 1 of article 25 of the revised Act contractres of government. However, the classification is not required in works contracts estimated value of less than € 500,000 or contracts for services estimated value of less than 200,000 euros. They do not require business classification, so typical concession contracts for public works, public service management, supply, collaboration between the public sector and the private sector and certain categories of services (*). In these contracts, whatever your budget tender must necessarily require proof of economic solvency and technical bidders according to one, several or all means provided for in articles 74 to 79 in the TRLCSP depending on the typical contract in question. In works contracts estimated value of less than 500,000 euros and services estimated value of less than € 200,000 can not be established as a prerequisite to apply for the classification of companies. These tenders must be determined in the Administrative clauses the economic, financial and technical entrepreneurs by one, several or all means to the provisions of Articles 74 and 79 of TRLCSP included this information in the ad tender. Require business classification as a mandatory condition for participation in tenders for contracts for works and services when the estimated value is less established in the 4th DT. TRLCSP -modifying by Article 43 of Law 14/2013 of 27 September-, is to prevent the participation of companies not classified contracts, according to the current regulations do not require this capability requirement. Imposing a requirement (for example, business classification) that prevents the participation of companies in public tenders when the legal requirement does not require this directly affects the principle of concurrent business activity is not subject to the Administration Act and therefore, we can say that root vitiate the validity of the contract award.

1198	Subject Headings for Church or Synagogue Libraries	https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED327215	This guide to subject headings for church or synagogue libraries begins by providing guidelines for the subject cataloging process. These guidelines are presented under seven headings: (1) Selecting the Subject Heading (by names of persons, religious congregations and orders, sects and denominations, places, holidays, and new subjects); (2) Specific Entry; (3) Subdivisions; (4) Cross References; (5) Subject Entry Cards; (6) Classification Numbers; and (7) Subject Authority File. Practical examples are provided which correspond to each of these headings. The subject heading list, which makes up the major part of the publication, includes classification numbers for each term that would most likely be found in a church or synagogue library. Suggestions for additional headings may be found in both the guidelines and in works listed in the bibliography. A list of some of the subject headings most used in collections of non-fiction children's books is also provided.
1199	Thesaurus of economics and social sciences	http://www.biblio.liuc.it/pagineita.asp?codice=210	ThESS - Thesaurus of Economics and Social Sciences of the Library Mario Rostoni is a controlled vocabulary constructed by drawing the terms mainly but not just from business-legal and business documents. ThESS is born and grows in relation to library acquisitions and the necessity to express the contents of the books to favor searches by subject. It is used in the following functions: Cataloging Acquired Library Material: Thesaurus terms are assigned to each bibliographic record as keywords and combined by catalogers in cohesive subject strings to express the subject of the book. Document Retrieval: Thesaurus terms enable those who seek to retrieve documents, either by combining them with a search mask or by scrolling through the lists. Terminology-Conceptual Analysis in Research Processes: The relationship between the terms of the thesaurus allows to enrich the terminological heritage of a field or a research topic, guiding other words related to meaning used in the library catalog or any other tool . This thesaurus usage is widely presented in the Information Literacy courses of the Laurea and Master's Degree courses at the LIUC University. ThESS is born with a priority reference to the needs of the study and research community formed by the students, researchers and faculty of the Faculty of Business Economics, Management Engineering and Law of the Carlo Cattaneo - LIUC University. It can also be useful to librarians, catalogers, information specialists who manage and bibliographic and documentary collections of the same disciplinary areas. ThESS is a multidisciplinary thesaurus, one-hierarchical, organized based on categories of about 7000 terms. Includes proper names. It is compiled in accordance with ISO 2788 (1986) and BS 8723-1/2 (2005) standards.

1202	CIMCIM Terminology	http://www.homepages.ed.ac.uk/am/itt/ittb.html	All of us are frequently confronted with the problem of identifying musical instruments and their components correctly, whether in the process of defining a part that has been damaged or restored, or trying to transmit our knowledge to school children, students or our academic colleagues. Occasionally this task is a distinct challenge due to the lack of a standardized terminology in the field of organology. Recognizing this fact, the Brasswind Terminology Working Group, which consists of four brass scholars at this point (Stewart Carter, Arnold Myers, Bradley Strauchen and myself), tries to develop a coherent terminology for brasswind instruments and their components in English. Our approach differs from hierarchical systems, such as the Hornbostel-Sachs classification - which is a 'downward' system - in its 'upward' orientation. We derive our terminology from the detailed inspection and delineation of an instrument in its musical, social, historical and technological contexts, rather than its classification according to general characteristics. The primary goal of the Brasswind Terminology Working Group is the standardization of brasswind terminology to create a commonly accepted, precise language, which eventually can be used by anyone concerned with this instrument type (organologists, musicologists, museum curators, instrument makers and others who have need to refer to these instruments). We hope that this project will stimulate the development of similar working groups for other types of instruments, and in languages other than English. A long-term goal is to create a generally accepted terminology for the field of organology that applies to instruments and their parts in a clear and consistent manner.
1203	Boggs and Lewis Classification of Maps and Atlases	http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015020109107	To classify maps, atlases, and globes most advantageously in a collection extensively used by geographers, historians, economists, technicians or other specialists and students, it is believed that the categories to be considered, in order of importance, are: (1) Area, (2) Subject, and (3) Date, with (4) Author, frequently necessary. When these four categories are insufficient to differentiate between maps in the collection, a fifth, Title, may be used. A sixth, Physical form, must be taken into account in filing globes, relief maps, maps mounted on rigid board or equipped with sticks or rods. The area-subject classification of maps corresponds to the classification of books by subject. The addition of date and, when necessary, author (or publisher), usually completes the differentiation of each map from every other map. Thus classified, a map has a single specific filing position relative to all the other maps; the flexible classification permits unlimited intercalation of new maps in their logical positions, regardless of the chance order of accession into the collection. It is believed that the notation which has been adopted, in which area is represented by numbers, and subject is represented by letters, gains merit from this obvious separation. The classification system needs at the outset to provide the framework for inclusion of every likely map subject, though it need not give an absolute location for the less common subjects. This forms a contrast with the subject heading list, which is infinitely expansive by nature.

1236	Global Medical Device Nomenclature	https://www.gmdnagency.org/	The Global Medical Device Nomenclature (GMDN) is a system of internationally agreed generic descriptors used to identify all medical device products. Such products include those used in the diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease or injury in humans. The main purpose of the GMDN is to provide health authorities and regulators, health care providers, medical device manufacturers and suppliers, conformity assessment bodies and others with a single generic naming system that will support patient safety. The GMDN is used for: Data exchange between manufacturers, regulators and healthcare authorities; Exchange of post-market vigilance information; Supporting inventory control in hospitals; Purchasing and supply chain management. Medical device experts from around the world (manufacturers, healthcare authorities and regulators) compiled the GMDN, based on the international standard ISO 15225. The work was mandated by the European Commission in order to provide the necessary tool to carry out the implementation of the Medical Devices Directive, including the European databank for medical devices, Eudamed. The GMDN meets the need to identify medical devices at the global level, as identified by the Global Harmonization Task Force (GHTF) and is now used by over 50 national medical device regulators. The GMDN is managed by the GMDN Agency, a non-profit organization, which reports to its Board of Trustees, that represents medical device regulators and industry. The GMDN Agency updates the GMDN utilizing member change requests, to add a new device terms to the GMDN. The decisions are made by an international expert team on how the new term is to be described, according to ISO 15225. The GMDN is available in English and 24 other languages. The GMDN Agency releases new and updated GMDN terms on a daily basis, on their interactive website, the GMDN Database. Information in the form of a 5 digit numeric GMDN Code is cross-referenced to a precisely defined descriptive Preferred Term, with which all specific devices have substantially similar generic features.

1257	ISO 4791-1:1985 Laboratory Apparatus Vocabulary	https://www.iso.org/standard/10770.html	This part of ISO 4791 lists the names of items of laboratory apparatus, made essentially from glass, porcelain or vitreous silica, together with items of equipment, made from other materials, which are commonly used in association with such apparatus. A vocabulary of technical terms, with their definitions and applicable to the manufacture, adjustment and use of such laboratory apparatus, will be issued as Part 2. The purpose of the vocabulary is to provide an aid to translators and readers of scientific literature. Because of the need to translate older documents, certain items of equipment now regarded as obsolete have been included.
1258	ISO 4885:1996 Ferrous Products - Heat Treatments Vocabulary	https://www.iso.org/standard/10878.html	This International Standard defines the terms used in the heat treatment of ferrous products. The vocabulary is divided into a main part (clause 3) and a complementary section (clause 4). The main part gives an alphabetical list of the terms with their definitions and, where appropriate, comments. A definition of a foreign term for which the language in question has no equivalent is given at the end of the main part. The complementary section comprises the definitions of terms necessary to understand the main part. The comments are given in note form in order to differentiate them from the definitions. Any term defined in the main part of this International Standard and used elsewhere in a definition or a comment is printed in bolder type than the main text.
1259			Office machines give rise to numerous international commercial exchanges which often become difficult, either because of the great variety of terms used in various fields or languages to express the same concept, or because of the absence of, or the imprecision of, useful concepts. To avoid misunderstandings due to this situation and to facilitate such exchanges, it is advisable to select terms to be used in various languages or in various countries to express the same concept and to establish definitions providing satisfactory equivalents for the various terms in different languages. The work of the ISO Sub-Committee charged with the study of the Vocabulary was based on various international documents issued by Sub-Committees of ISO Technical Committee 95 and on national drafts or standards. ISO 5138 consists of several sections published separately, each section dealing with a category of office machines. The numbering of these sections, beginning with 01, depends on the chronological order of their development. A basic classification of machines has been introduced at the beginning of each section, before the vocabulary proper.

(It is also used in a simplified form in combination with various prefixes for special types of material: R, the reference collection in the Reading Room; S, 'select' books on closed access; P, L, T, Q, primary, secondary, select and dead periodicals, respectively; Z, mutilated books. Some other open access collections, such as music and reference collections in specialised reading rooms, have their own schemes.) This edition represents current practice and interpretation; inspection of the shelves will reveal classes superseded by more detailed subdivision or abandoned entirely, while policy on some of the less specific categories or on new areas of study will be found to have evolved over time. In recent years it has rarely been possible to reclassify in accordance with such changes and developments.

131	American Museum of Natural History/Division of Anthropology/Collections Thesaurus	http://anthro.amnh.org/thesaurus	This thesaurus is based upon the Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) produced by The Getty Research Institute and follows as closely as possible its theoretical model for the organization of concepts (categories). Where the AAT differs in its description of an object or concept found in the AMNH collection, the AMNH term is inserted into the appropriate position in the existing AAT hierarchy. It was designed to demonstrate the capabilities of a thesaurus in searching across the AMNH anthropological collections and to generate feedback from researchers and the public. It currently contains around 1,000 categories and 10,000 terms linked to these categories. Currently, the seven 'top level' terms and the vast majority of the 'mid level' terms (categories) come directly from the AAT while all of the 'bottom level' terms and a few of the 'mid level' terms are derived from AMNH keywords. The goal of this thesaurus is to allow users to browse through a hierarchical structure to locate individual objects and to see broader, narrower, and related terms rather than having to perform a tradition search on individual terms. The terms are used to retrieve objects in the collections database.

A subject thesaurus is a list of subject keywords that can be used to index or classify documents that are about a particular topic. These subject keywords can then be used by search engines to provide relevant results pertaining to a particular subject. The IST includes relationships between keywords and phrases such as broader terms, narrower terms, preferred terms, non-preferred terms or related terms. The purpose of these relationships is to help indexers/classifiers to find the best subject keywords to describe the ""aboutness"" of documents. Also, these relationships can help searchers by providing preferred and related subject terms to use in a search. The IST is a bilingual thesaurus of subject terms describing the work of INAC. It includes more than 2800 terms in English and more that 2900 terms in French, including almost 1300 preferred terms in each language. The IST conforms to internationally accepted standards and conventions for thesaurus construction (i.e. Guidelines for the construction, format and management of monolingual controlled vocabularies (ANSI/NISO Z39.19-2005), Guidelines for the establishment and development of monolingual thesauri (ISO 2788-1986) and the Guidelines for the establishment and development of multilingual thesauri (ISO 5964-1985))."

The extended version (SKB-E) is used in libraries with a more specialized subject book. The notations of both variants of the system are given in the review magazines of the Catholic library work, the 'bookprofiles' and the 'media profiles', for each revised title. A 'Stich- und Schlagwortregister' was published on the Sachbuch system. On the one hand, it helps in the librarianship in the consultation of readers. It also makes it easier to classify newly acquired books and other media into the relevant subject groups. The register provides, for example, information on the question of where books and media are classified as 'age'. Through the use of appropriate library software the classification of the newly acquired titles into the subject groups and the information service in the library are made much easier. The programs developed for the Catholic Library work contain the entire system and the terms from the 'Stich- und Schlagwortregister'."

1335	Marianist Library Classification	http://www.nacms.org/library/marianist-library-classification#.VT34jGOEM83	The schedules that form the Marianist Library Classification were developed because the classification scheme most commonly used in Marianist libraries, 'Marianist Classification 1960; For Archives and Documentary Libraries' developed by Father William Ferree, SM, became impossible to implement successfully. Years of work and consultation with experts in Marianist history and spirituality as well as input from Mr. Thompson A. Yee, Acting Chief of the Cataloging and Policy Support Office at the Library of Congress, have resulted in this new approach to classifying materials by and about the Marianists. The organizational basis for the schedules comes from the classes developed and defined by Brother Lawrence Scrivani, SM, in his 'Classification Scheme for Marianist Documents Libraries'. In their application, the present schedules gather and organize Marianist works by topic or subject and are designed to follow Library of Congress cataloging practices and procedures.

So, it is actually a little easier, partly because building parts in terrain and building parts in buildings are now clearly separated. It will also be easier to keep Controls the characteristics of the building components because the classification includes a systematic description of property data. The main innovation of the Management Classification, however, is that it includes the overall systematics required when moving from the traditional document-based situation where the same information often finds S in several places and in several variants and into a modern digital web-based world where the individual information is only available and updated in one place and from which it is accessible to everyone.

1368	Thesaurus of University Terms	http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015048537719	In creating TUT we relied extensively on existing finding aids to generate terms and tested the thesaurus against a broad range of record series, thus ensuring that the vocabulary would have literary warrant. We wanted a system that was easy to learn and use and that did not impose a too-limited context on the descriptors. The most difficult and important task was arriving at an organizational scheme that is not tied to the organizational structure of this university. The university's structure and delegation of tasks is in a constant state of flux. A system based on the status quo would not necessarily work in ten years or even for records ten years old. The thesaurus that we created will describe the activities and functions of the university regardless of who performed them. We also have no desire to duplicate the physical arrangement which makes possible easy retrieval of records by office of origin. What resulted from our efforts is a four-part subject thesaurus that describes the people, functions, and activities of the university. The first section, Hierarchy of university Terms (HUT), is for functions and activities. The second, Administrative and academic departments, Schools, and Centers (ASC) is for names of these organizational units. The third, GEOgraphic locations (GEO) is for names of buildings and campus locations. (Although these two are of only local value we have included them to show how we handled the problem of specific names and titles that are necessary for description, especially to modify university activities and to limit searches. They also provide a pattern for creating similar lists for other institutions.) The fourth part, FORM, is a list of record types or forms that is used primarily as a device to narrow searches. (A search for information about a student government event can prevent retrieval of posters, for example.)

This structured vocabulary reflects the scope of DOE's research, development, and technological programs and encompasses terminology derived not only from the basic sciences but also from the areas of energy resources, conservation, safety, environmental impact, and regulation. The terminology of this thesaurus controls the subject searching of the Energy Data Base (EDB) available on the DOE on-line retrieval systems. The terminology is also used for the subject control of other OSTI data bases available only on DOE/RECON. Descriptors are added to the thesaurus on the basis of need, i.e., when a document contains a concept for which there is no adequate term or terms in the thesaurus. (...) There are over 25,000 entries.
1372	International Energy Subject Thesaurus	http://dx.doi.org/10.2172/10104004	The International Energy Agency: Subject Thesaurus contains the standard vocabulary of indexing terms (descriptors) developed and structured to build and maintain energy information databases. Involved in this cooperative task are (1) the technical staff of the U.S. DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) in cooperation with the member countries of the International Energy Agency`s Energy Technology Data Exchange (ETDE) and (2) the International Atomic Energy Agency`s International Nuclear Information System (INIS) staff representing the more than 100 countries and organizations that record and index information for the international nuclear information community. ETDE member countries are also members of INIS. Nuclear information prepared for INIS by ETDE member countries is included in the ETDE Energy Database, which contains the online equivalent of the printed INIS Atomindex. Indexing terminology is therefore cooperatively standardized for use in both information systems. This structured vocabulary reflects the scope of international energy research, development, and technological programs. The terminology of this thesaurus aids in subject searching on commercial systems, such as 'Energy Science & Technology' by DIALOG Information Services, 'Energy' by STN International and the 'ETDE Energy Database' by SilverPlatter. It is also the thesaurus for the Integrated Technical Information System (ITIS) online databases of the US Department of Energy. Descriptors are added to the thesaurus as needed (i.e., when a document contains a concept for which there is no adequate term or terms in the thesaurus). More than 27,000 appear in this document, which replaces the U.S. DOE publication Energy Data Base: Subject Thesaurus.

1375	Environmental/Chemical thesaurus	http://dx.doi.org/10.2172/6643293	The Environmental/Chemical Thesaurus approaches scientific language control problems from a multidisciplinary view. The Environmental/Biomedical Terminology Index (EBTI) was used as a base for the present thesaurus. The Environmental/Chemical Thesaurus, funded by the Environmental Protection Agency, used as its source of new terms those major terms found in 13 Environmental Protection Agency data bases. The scope of this thesaurus includes not only environmental and biomedical sciences, but also the physical sciences with emphasis placed on chemistry. Specific chemical compounds are not included; only classes of chemicals are given. To adhere to this level of classification, drugs and pesticides are identified by class rather than by specific chemical name. An attempt was also made to expand the areas of sociology and economics. Terminology dealing with law, demography, and geography was expanded. Proper names of languages and races were excluded. Geographic terms were expanded to include proper names for oceans, continents, major lakes, rivers, and islands. Political divisions were added to allow for proper names of countries and states. With such a broad scope, terminology for specific sciences does not provide for indexing to the lowest levels in plant, animal, or chemical classifications.

Subject classification is used for the purpose of grouping the documents under The same theme, as a way to expedite its recovery and to facilitate the archival tasks related to the evaluation, selection, elimination, transfer, recollection and access to these documents, since the archival work is carried out based on the content of the document, which The classification defines, therefore, the physical organization of the archived documents, constituting a basic reference for its recovery. In the classification code, the functions, activities, species and Document types generally referred to as subjects, are hierarchically According to the functions and activities performed by the body. In other words, the sums are given numeric codes, which reflect the functional hierarchy of the organ, defined through classes, subclasses, groups and subgroups, always starting from the general to the particular. For this instrument the model of decimal classification code was adopted. As the name implies, the decimal system of classification by subjects constitutes a numerical code divided in ten classes and these in turn in ten subclasses and so on.

CCC of Nursing Interventions/Actions consists of 804 Concepts (201 Core Interventions [77 major & 124 subcategories)]. The two terminologies are both classified by 21 Care Components that represent the Functional, Health Behavioral, Physiological, and Psychological Patterns of Patient Care. (...) The coding structure for the two terminologies is based on the ICD-10 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health-Related Problems, 1990) consisting of five alphanumeric characters for information exchange among health care terminologies promoting interoperability. They are used to track and measure patient/client care holistically over time, across settings, population groups, and geographic locations. (...) The CCC System is recognized as the terminology of choice for documenting the essence of patient care in the electronic health record (EHR) systems. It meets all the features of a concept-oriented terminology and has been formally accepted by the various standards organizations. (...) The CCC System is being used to document nursing care in the electronic health record (EHR) computer-based patient record (CPR) and Personal Health Record (PHR) Systems. It serves as a language for nursing and other health care providers such as physical, occupational, and speech therapists, medical social workers, etc.

149	Pocket Catholic Thesaurus	http://www.therealpresence.org/Thesaurus/intro.htm	Over a decade's, diligent research was devoted to a professional search for an existing thesaurus – to facilitate the classification, and processing, of all essential information on Roman Catholicism. Personal visits were made to Catholic Universities; many librarians and scholars were interviewed; extensive correspondence was exchanged with religious orders; specialized institutes were contacted; all applicable library science, and data-processing literature was analyzed. Two consistent responses emerged from the preponderance of respondents. First, 'There is no existing, broad-scope, professional-quality, Catholic-information, classification system!' Second, 'We sure need a practical, classification system to: promptly and efficiently process the overwhelming flood of incoming information; facilitate its entrance into the electronic era!'

1507	Classification of the Literature of Freemasonry and Related Societies		"The Masonic Classification herewith presented is the result of some twenty-two years of practical experience in the largest masonic library in the world — the Library of the Supreme Council, 33rd Degree at Washington. This Library, in addition to its thousands of items on Freemasonry and related societies, contains also thousands upon thousands of general works in all branches of literature. These latter works are classified according to the well-known Dewey Decimal System, but this system provides no classification of freemasonry, assigning one class only to the subject, which class is practically incapable of subdivision. The scheme which I have devised and which is in successful practical operation, provides for nearly four hundred classes and sub-classes. Practically all masonic libraries contain much general literature, but as they specialize on freemasonry, it becomes necessary to provide some system which will allow of their classification independently of the general library. Many libraries use the Dewey Decimal System, and I have devised the present scheme to prevent confusion, not only in the classification, but also in the catalogue card number, the book label number, the shelf guide number, and in various other ways, the letter ""M"" (Masonry) arbitrarily prefixed to the digits, always indicating the card, the book, its label, and the shelf-guide, as of masonic import. The entire range of masonic literature is divided into ten great classes, somewhat similar to Dewey's ten great classes of general literature. These ten classes are subdivided again and again to suit the requirements of the literature on a given subject. For example, if we have a general history of freemasonry, it goes in class M10. If it is a history of Freemasonry in Europe, it goes in class M17.940, the M17, indicating that it is a geographical division of masonic history, and the 940, indicating that it is a history of Freemasonry in Europe, the 940 being Dewey's notation for Europe. Again, take the class M20, which is Customs and Paraphernalia. Any general work on the subject would go in this class, but if the library possessed literature on the Obituary Rites of freemasonry, it would go in class M20.01; if it had works on Paraphernalia, they would go in class M21; Jewels and Medals would go in M22, and so on."

The database contains currently some 40,000 items drawn from 1,800 publications, with new ones being added on a continuous basis. (...) The Glossary complements and in many cases draws from the International Electrotechnical Vocabulary (IEV) published by TC 1 (Terminology). The IEV is the authoritative source for 'standardized IEC terminology' organized into some 80 subject areas. The Glossary is of a more limited nature. Its definitions relate to the source standard from which they are extracted. A term can therefore have different meanings, depending on the context in which it is used. The Glossary should be considered as an informative document as the terms and definitions have been separated from the context in which they are applied."

154	BioTop	http://purl.org/biotop/biotop.owl	The flood of data and factual knowledge in biology and medicine requires principled approaches to their proper analysis and management. A cornerstone in this effort constitutes the precise and complete description of the fundamental entities within this domain in terms of formal ontologies. However, biomedical ontology development often still do not adhere to basic design principles: For example, even very low-level domain terms often lack precise and unambiguous (logical) definitions. This impedes the move towards semantic standardization that is needed for their intended knowledge management task. Rather, it leads to inconsistencies, fragmentation and overlap both within and inbetween different ontologies. In light of this we introduce BioTop, a top-domain ontology that provides definitions for the foundational entities of biomedicine as a basic vocabulary to unambiguously describe facts in this domain. BioTop can furthermore serve as top-level model for creating new ontologies for more specific domains or as aid for aligning or improving existing ones. BioTop is founded upon formal design principles (as propagated by the OBO Foundry initiative) and implemented in OWL-DL, the standard ontology language on the Semantic Web. BioTop makes use of the whole range of constructors of OWL-DL. The use of OWL-DL makes it possible to apply description logics reasoners for maintaining consistency by continuous classficiation during development and to automatically infer its hierarchical structure. To this end, we try to fully define as much classes as possible (in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions).

(...) The data model (data-centric) allows for a (metadata) representation of research entities, their activities / interconnections (research) and their output (results) as well as high flexibility with formal (semantic) relationships, enables quality maintenance, archiving, access and interchange of research information and supports knowledge transfer to decision makers, for research evaluation, research managers, strategists, researchers, editors and the general public. A CRIS can be implemented using a subset or superset of the full CERIF model for projects, people, organisations, publications, patents, products, services and facilities (equipment in particular) with role-based, temporally-bound relationships. The advantages of CERIF are: its neutral architecture; the data model can be implemented [relational, object-oriented, information retrieval (including WWW)]; the process model can be implemented [DBMS and query (centralised or distributed), HTML web / harvesting / IR-query, advanced knowledge-based technology]. But interoperation requires a structured schema. Today CERIF is used as a model for implementation of a standalone CRIS (but interoperation ready), as a model to define the wrapper around a legacy non-CERIF CRIS to allow homogeneous access to heterogeneous systems and as a definition of a data exchange format to create a common data warehouse from several CRIS.

1634	Uniclass		"Launched in 1997, Uniclass, the classification for the construction industry, is the UK implementation of BS ISO 12006-2, providing a structured approach to classifying the building information by organising information based upon common characteristics. The recent developments and wide-adoption of BIM to manage information across the project timeline, has meant the need for a unified approach to classification, ensuring that information is universally structured regardless of the author. This lead to a review of Uniclass and the development of Uniclass2."" ""A classification system is an essential tool for organising information. Without an agreed, comprehensive system for organising construction information it will be impossible to ensure interoperability between different information systems, design tools, and facilities management tools, with data entered once and re-used several times through the process. A construction classification system must include buildings, infrastructure and integrated project and office management. It must be able to map project information from the initial concept through brief, detailed design, construction, handover and facility operation and maintenance. To fully adopt the BIM process it is important to organise such information systematically and consistently. Uniclass 2 has been developed to produce a classification system for structuring information that is freely available for all participants throughout the life cycle of a project and beyond, which is endorsed by all construction and property bodies and professional institutions. It is dynamic, available online in various formats and managed by a team of experts who will monitor requests, update and control versioning."
1635	PLOS Subject Area Thesaurus		The 'Subject Areas' panel on each article page displays a set of terms selected for that article based on its content. The Subject Areas belong to a thesaurus of over 10,000 terms initially built for us over the course of 2012 by Access Innovations, taking into account the controlled vocabulary of classification terms that had been in use in PLOS Editorial Manager. The entire corpus of PLOS articles was analysed to ensure that the thesaurus covers the research domain comprehensively. Specific terms are associated with articles by Machine Aided Indexing (MAI) which identifies text strings in the articles and matches them to Subject Area terms from the thesaurus. The output ranks the matches in order of frequency of hits within the text of the article and the top eight terms are selected for display. Whereas previously the eight terms were presented in alphabetical order, we are introducing weightings to the Subject Area panel, such that the order of Subject Areas will reflect the frequency of hits in the MAI process. This new presentation will be introduced progressively, beginning with the main Article tab. The MAI process uses a Rulebase to guide Subject Area selection. Whereas identifying a phrase such as 'Retinitis pigmentosa' is relatively straightforward for software, the issue is more complex for a word such as 'Sodium' where the relevant Subject Area might be 'Voltage-gated sodium channels', any of several sodium compounds or even just 'Sodium' the element. The rule for terms such as 'Sodium' are therefore compound and include conditional statements to disambiguate these different contexts. While the vast majority of terms are effectively indexed there remain ambiguities for some terms and part of our work is to continue to identify these cases and modify the Rulebase accordingly. The Subject Area terms are related to each other with a system of broader/narrower term relationships. The thesaurus structure is a polyhierarchy, so for example the Subject Area 'White blood cells' has two broader terms 'Blood cells' and 'Immune cells'. At its deepest the hierarchy is ten tiers deep, with all terms tracking back to one or more of the top tier Subject Areas, such as 'Biology and life sciences' or 'Social sciences'. The Subject Area terms can be used to filter PLOS content via the Subject-specific option in Advanced Search. The MAI Rulebase accommodates synonyms, so a Subject-specific Search for 'Highly active antiretroviral therapy' will retrieve articles based on MAI matches to 'HAART' (a known synonym) as well as 'Highly active antiretroviral therapy' in one step. Additionally, because we select the most frequently MAI-indexed Subject Areas for each article the Search returns articles where the Subject Area in question ranks highly enough to be included in the top eight MAI-retrieved terms, so is of relatively high significance, whereas a query term in an “All fields” search will return every article that contains even a single match to the query term. The hierarchical nature of the thesaurus also enhances article retrieval in Search. Not only does Search retrieve all articles specifically indexed by MAI with the query Subject Area term in question, but it also retrieves all articles specifically indexed with any Subject Area term that sits deeper into the hierarchy than the query Subject Area term, but on the same broader/narrower term path. Thus, in the 'White blood cells' example, queries for either 'Blood cells' or 'Immune cells' will return all articles indexed with 'White blood cells'. The Subject Area terms on all article pages are hyperlinked and following the link returns a listing of all articles to which that Subject Area term applies. Subject Area terms can also be used as the basis for Saved Searches, RSS feeds and PLOS ONE customized Journal Alerts. The content of the PLOS thesaurus and the Rulebase that governs the application of Subject Areas to the articles is constantly under review. We incorporate analysis of the Subject Area panel 'feedback' clicks into this review process, and are always happy to receive specific input on Subject Area terms and their application by email. We update the thesaurus behind the PLOS sites several times each year.
1636	Checklist Political Education	http://www.die-bonn.de/esprid/dokumente/doc-2003/koerber03_01.pdf	In this system, the two main tasks of a modern political-social education are contained: (1) the mediation and reflection of political and social knowledge for the purpose of the individual judgment and opinion formation with regard to upcoming social problems and problems; The promotion and support of competences, motives and emotional dispositions for competent and socially responsible commitment and action to deal with or solve these tasks and problems. The systematic approach follows a trend - setting trend which has been empirically observable for several years in political education Outside-school youth and adult education in general - in addition to the mediation and processing of information and knowledge the development of skills, motivation and social-moral dispositions gain in importance.
1637	Combined Nomenclature	http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm	The Combined Nomenclature is the goods classification used within the EU for the purposes of foreign trade statistics. It is also used by Directorate General 'Taxation and Customs Union' of the European Commission for customs duty purposes. The classification is maintained by Eurostat for the statistical aspects and by Taxation and Customs Union DG for the tariff aspects. The classification is based on the Harmonized System (HS) which it sub-divides where necessary for purposes of external trade, agricultural regulation and customs duties. The CN was introduced in 1988 together with the HS. Subheadings in the CN are identified by means of an eight-digit numerical code. The very considerable number of subdivisions within the CN were introduced with the EU's specific customs and foreign trade statistics requirements in mind. The CN is revised annually and, as a Council Regulation, is binding on the Member States. It appears in all EU official languages (except Irish).
1638	Controlled Health Thesaurus	http://www.cdc.gov/phin/library/archive_2005/CHT_Download_05-04-05.zip	CDC’s Thesaurus is structured around preferred concepts, sourced whenever possible from standard vocabularies, with their associated properties (metadata) in a polyhierarchical framework. The preferred concept bacillus anthracis, for example, has defined associations to the concept Anthrax (the disease caused by the target organism) and to the concept Anthrax vaccines (the prevention for the disease). This organism term is 'treed' in the polyhierarchy as both a soilborne bacillus organism and as a biological agent. The parent concept Anthrax has child concepts Cutaneous anthrax, Gastrointestinal anthrax, and Pulmonary anthrax. Thus the utilization of this cluster of concepts on a website or within an application enables a rich retrieval of all anthrax-related information. (...) The Controlled Health Thesaurus is a public health view of pertinent concepts from the National Library of Medicine’s Metathesaurus. Additional concepts needed to cover the public health domain are being added and will be advanced to NLM. CDC Research revealed that the National Library of Medicine’s Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) provided the broadest coverage of concepts for public health. Additional concepts from other UMLS vocabularies, such as the Computerized Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects (CRISP), Alcohol and Other Drug Thesaurus (AOD), and Library of Congress Subject Headings will be utilized as needed. CDC is leveraging the expertise of its subject matter experts and its public health partners to add additional public health concepts. Requirements for Thesaurus structuring and metadata selection came from the ANSI/NISO Z39.19 Guidelines for the Construction, Format, and Management of Monolingual Thesauri. The standard deals with aspects of term selection and the means for establishing and displaying relationships between terms.

164	British Education Thesaurus	http://www.leeds.ac.uk/bei/COLN/COLN_default.html	The British Education Index continues to serve its original, 50-year old, purpose as an independent subject and author index to the contents of significant education journals published in the UK. Within limitiations imposed by its self-financing status, the BEI also seeks to identify information from an increasingly diverse research environment, particularly addressing texts on the Internet and events, as detailed below. All BEI services are created and maintained by staff whose costs are met by income from royalties and from occasional contracted work, and who use custom-built but potentially widely exploitable information management tools to do their work. The British Education Thesaurus vocabulary was used for subject indexing, for example, allowing for the eventual closer connection between Education-line and the BEI database. (The British Education Thesaurus was first produced by the BEI in 1988 to provide a means to facilitate consistent subject indexing of literature by the Index.)

1643	Language of Bindings Thesaurus	http://www.ligatus.org.uk/lob/	The Language of Bindings Thesaurus (LoB) includes terms which can be used to describe historical binding structures. The thesaurus can be used as a lookup resource through this website and also as a software service where the terms can be retrieved directly through your own application. LoB is a young project and community contribution will ensure that it will be improved. (...) The thesaurus is structured based on the Simple Knowledge Organisation System (SKOS). Some of the main principle of that system are: We define concepts (not words) to avoid common problems such as when different communities use different words for the same idea. Each concept can have a number of labels (language words) which refer to the concept, with one of them being a recommended label (preferred label) and the rest being the alternative labels. Concepts are organised from the more general ones, the broader concepts, to the more specific ones, the narrower (broader / narrower relationship). A narrower term should always describe a concept which is included in the parent concept. For example, adzes is a narrower concept of tools and equipment because all adzes are tools. (...) LoB concepts are described in the so-called scope notes, which aim to give both a brief definition of each concept as well as a broader indication of what the concept is about, together with some historical information where this is known and relevant. (...) Where possible we have matched our concepts with concepts from the Getty AAT. Our intention is to submit LoB concepts to the AAT where corresponding terms do not exist. (...) The thesaurus is meant to be used as part of a documentation system. We recognise the value of the CIDOC-CRM in the documentation of cultural heritage. For this reason we have chosen our top concepts to match CIDOC-CRM entities so that their narrower concept hierarchies can be used as E55 Type for these entities in a documentation system. However, using a CRM compatible documentation system is not required.
1644	CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model	http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/	The CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) provides definitions and a formal structure for describing the implicit and explicit concepts and relationships used in cultural heritage documentation. The CIDOC CRM is intended to promote a shared understanding of cultural heritage information by providing a common and extensible semantic framework that any cultural heritage information can be mapped to. It is intended to be a common language for domain experts and implementers to formulate requirements for information systems and to serve as a guide for good practice of conceptual modelling. In this way, it can provide the 'semantic glue' needed to mediate between different sources of cultural heritage information, such as that published by museums, libraries and archives.
1645	Thesaurus of Old English	http://oldenglishthesaurus.arts.gla.ac.uk/	This presentation of Old English vocabulary is conceptually arranged, and is therefore entitled A Thesaurus of Old English (TOE). The vocabulary of Anglo-Saxon England is presented within ordered categories. Ideally, the reader should approach the materials of the TOE by subject rather than through the alphabetic index of the printed edition. Roget-owners have long been accustomed to begin with a word and, by trying a few locations listed in the index, find the vocabulary group wanted. Moreover, for inclusiveness they trade detailed information. Should a word's precise meaning be wanted, a dictionary is needed. Most conceptually-organized thesauri tend therefore to be used by native speakers of a language, who know the meanings of the words scanned. Less assured speakers may turn to those alphabetically-organized thesauri where they will find more help with meaning but far fewer words. In the TOE any small group of items listed together as sharing a component of meaning resembles the strings of words that make up the entries of an alphabetically-organized thesaurus, but they are embedded within an inclusive conceptual scheme. The provision of brief indications of meaning at all levels of this scheme looks back behind Roget, to the way in which Wilkins supplies notions and words, where word-senses follow on from ideas explained. Thus, this thesaurus incorporates information about word meaning and could be described as an inside-out dictionary, with meanings first and then words.

1648	thesaurA	http://www.frida.at/thesaura.htm	"With this project idea thesaurA - the name represents the feminist transformation of the male term 'thesaurus' and accentuated by the capitalization of the feminine ending the Austrian-specific approach - a concept was adopted which had already been implemented several times internationally: already in the 70s The American Thesaurus 'On Equal Terms' had been published, the first German-language thesaurus was published in 1994 by the Cologne 'FrauenMediaTurm'. Language and language behavior in a society are, as is well known, characterized by power structures and governance processes. This also means that linguistic norms represent linguistic actions. The use of language in our society is based on male values ​​and at the same time discriminates against women in several ways: he is sexist. Since keyword catalogs and thesauri are basically based on compilations of predominantly natural language terms, the conventional spelling of conventional Austrian documentation facilities is sexist. But also in other respects an anachronistic and useless hostile state is to be established. Within the last twenty years, in the context of the New Women's Movement and the influence of feminist criticism, social awareness about gender relations has been at least a reflection process. This has also resulted in different intensity reactions in science and in daily politics. The constantly growing amount of women-oriented literature, however, is opposed to a catchword which is not suitable for exhaustively evaluating feminist / woman-specific documentation material. This deficit is to be countered by proposing suggestions and providing assistance in the implementation of three sociolinguistic principles. The linguistic visualization of women is to be enforced by eliminating the universally argued male language form. Thus, if the content of a document refers to women and men, a codification must be carried out, which makes both sexes visible. Here, however, a gender specification is meant not only with regard to person names such as ""asylum seekers"" or ""asylum seekers"" or ""female youngsters"" or ""male youngsters"", but also as a feminine innovation in the case of composites such as ""workers' Workers 'movement' and 'Christianity'. (...) The first Austrian women's thesaurus as a reference book for orientation in the field of women's and gender studies contains 467 pages and consists of a manual, the main part with about 3000 terms, a permutation register and an index of the subjects according to subject group systematics; As additional documentary tools, four special lists - professional groups, form keywords, geographics and time-lapse words - are attached. The target groups of thesaurA include the content developers in both institutionalized documentation institutions and libraries, as well as in smaller specialized women's libraries, archives and documentation centers. However, the vocabulary should also be available to the users of these institutions in order to assist in the effective search for information."

1657	Library-Bibliographical Classification	http://lod.rsl.ru/	The Library-Bibliographical Classification (LBC), which is the National Classification System of the Russian Federation, is considered as one of the largest universal classification systems according to the opinion of International Society of Knowledge Organization (ISKO). The LBC is the newest classification system applied in the world today. It appeared in 1960-s, whereas Melwil Dewey’s Decimal Classification (DDC) was submitted in 1876, the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) – in 1895–1905, the Library of Congress Classification (LCC) – in 1912, S. R. Ranganathan’s Colon Classification (CC) – in 1936. By its semantic power the LBC can be compared with the UDC. The LBC belongs to the combinative systems (as well as the UDC); its capability cannot be measured in the quantity of main schedules divisions because the quantity of combinations with divisions of auxiliary classification tables is immeasurable. The system’s newness indicates its science-based structure and the accordance between its content and the contemporary level of science development and social practice. The LBC is a permanently developing system. The LBC has a broad range of options available – for scientific, public (termed 'mass' in the USSR before 1991), regional libraries as well as full, medium or abridged schedules – presented now both in books and in machine-readable (electronic) form. None of existing classification system could have survived that sort of severe social upheaval which had fallen to the lot of the LBC. Created in the USSR, it fully reflected the ideology of Soviet society. Only few years needed to accomplish the task of deideologization of its content entirely and to ensure the process of modernization, in fact, the updating of all the structure and contents. As a result, there came a schedules different from the Soviet LBC for its structure and content. In 2001, the commencing issue of the Medium LBC schedules appeared (the publishing is still proceeding: 6 of 9-10 issues have already been published). It is hard for libraries to have time to master each new issue of the schedules: the changes are so significant that it can even be necessary to start new ranges of catalogs, to restructure the book collections completely. The LBC is the National classification system of the Russian Federation. It adequately covers history, philosophy, economics, and geography of Russia, art and culture of its peoples, doing that as completely as no foreign classification could do. The LBC is now used in 95% of libraries in our country.
1658	The national term bank of science	http://tieteentermipankki.fi/wiki/Termipankki:Etusivu	The Bank of Finnish Terminology in Arts and Sciences is a multidisciplinary project which aims to gather a permanent terminological database for all fields of research in Finland. The project has created a Semantic MediaWiki platform, which offers a collaborative environment. The semantic MediaWiki platform is an open collaborative website. This means that anyone can freely use it and also participate in the discussion about terms. The data available for all users includes the following details: The term and its synonyms in Finnish; Definition(s); The concept's place in the concept system and concept diagrams; Information about the term’s morphological structure; Ostensive definitions (e.g. pictures); Contexts (e.g. links to abstracts of articles); Term equivalents in other languages (and information about the translatability of terms when necessary). The working method is a type of limited crowd-sourcing. The terminology will be gathered among expert groups in different fields of research. The project is being carried out in three pilot projects: botany, jurisprudence, and linguistics. In the course of the pilot projects, the operations models for the teamwork of expert groups will be developed in order to take into account varying practices and terminological demands in different subfields of research. The published view of each terminological entry will be defined by the relevant expert group and customized to fit the special needs of each field of research. The core of the terminological work is done by expert teams from various fields of the arts and science. The members of each expert team have access to a wide range of wiki editing resources and can add information into every slot of the database in their field of expertise. They will also label the definition of a term as “checked” when they think that it meets the standards of the field. It is also possible to include existing terminologies in the bank – of course with the permission of those who own the copyright.

1667	TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors	http://www.uicc.org/resources/tnm	The classification of cancer by anatomic disease extent, i.e. stage, is the major determinant of appropriate treatment and prognosis. Stage is an increasingly important component of cancer surveillance and cancer control and an endpoint for the evaluation of the population-based screening and early detection efforts. The UICC has published the UICC TNM classification of malignant tumours for over 50 years. The UICC TNM classification is the internationally accepted standard for cancer staging. The UICC TNM Classification is an anatomically based system that records the primary and regional nodal extent of the tumor and the absence or presence of metastases. (...) The UICC TNM staging system is the common language in which oncology health professionals can communicate on the cancer extent for individual patients as a basis for decision making on treatment management and individual prognosis but can also be used, to inform and evaluate treatment guidelines, national cancer planning and research. (...) The TNM classification is a unified standard and is a prerequisite for ensuring the quality of care in all resource-settings. It goes beyond clinician practice and constitutes vital information for policy-makers developing or implementing cancer control and prevention plans and it is therefore important to include the TNM classification as part of cancer registration.

1680	ETIM Classification	http://prod.etim-international.com/class	Product classification is simply a logical, unambiguous classification (taxonomy) of products in different product classes (categories), designed so that anyone within the sector can communicate about those products without misunderstandings. The ETIM model gives a listing of the most important technical characteristics of each product class to describe and find the products. Each class has several synonyms, thereby finding the right product is much easier for everyone! (...) Uniform product classification in itself is not a final product as it is. The product classification is also not a software application, product database, product generator or search engine. Those are applications that use the article classification as a basis. The product classification offers the structure for standardised product data that you can exchange in a uniform way via the communication standards and which can be used in numerous applications. (...) With the gradual growth of acceptance of product classification, it is remarkable how trading companies hesitate to participate out of fear of price comparison. They are afraid that the transparency of product information makes it easier to compare product prices. This does contain a grain of truth. On the other hand, this is already possible with current technology and the product price is of course only one of the many selection criteria for a customer. Aspects such as quality, delivery reliability, logistical performance and supplier expertise also play an important role for a customer. A supplier that is capable of providing product information electronically has the preference, because it saves the parties a lot of time and therefore also money.
1681	DBK-Classification	https://bips.dk/v%C3%A6rkt%C3%B8jsemne/dbk-klassifikation#0	DBK was the first bid for a coherent classification system for construction in Denmark and was developed in the period 2003-2006. DBK is a common system for classification of building and building information - developed for the Digital Building. DBK replaces the old SfB system And different industry-oriented or home-based systems. DBK is subsequently replaced by CCS. Classification is necessary to keep track of the many different types of information that is part of a construction project or in connection with building operations. The DBK classification system establishes a basic information structure, a coherent systematics And a common conceptual device that ensures precise communication. At the same time, it identifies any piece of information uniquely, making it easy to retrieve and recognize. It is a crucial prerequisite for digitizing the construction processes - and at the same time provides the basis for developing requirements specifications for development Off i T tools for construction. DBK establishes frameworks to classify all parts of the construction throughout its life cycle - from program to disposal. The system thus classifies not only building parts, buildings and rooms, but also actors, processes, documents, experience and building knowledge information, etc. DBK is also considerably more complex than, for example, SfB, as DBK considers a building component from different aspects or angles. For this reason, DBK operates with a product aspect (what the object consists of), a form aspect (how it looks), a functional aspect (how it is used) and a placement aspect (how it is built).
1682	DK5 Decimal Classification	http://www.dbc.dk/nationale-opgaver/dk5	DK5 is the common setup and classification system for the Danish public and school libraries. The system consists of a systematic overview of subject areas and an alphabetical and a systematic register, respectively. (...) DK5 is an aspect-oriented classification system. The 100 main groups are Subdivided according to the decimal principle. The primary division in the decimal class division takes place according to disciplines and subjects. The structure is in principle hierarchical in both notation and group relations. The aim is that DK5's systematics reflect as much as possible the knowledge universe that is expressed in the current Danish Publicity The objective of timeliness implies that audits can be made in the system and system terminology on an ongoing basis. It must be kept up to date in accordance with professional / social development. However, in a controlled system, there will always be some reversal in the audit work. General level: DK5's specificity Developed to correspond to the need for comminution by the national bibliographic registration of physical materials that are set up according to the system. In other words, the development of the general level of DK5 relates to its function as a setup system.

Regular updates of the TOP-Thesaurus are planned based on community involvement.
1688	COGS	http://vocab.deri.ie/cogs	The growing availability of data on the Web provided by Web 2.0 applications and, more recently through Linked Data, brought the computational pattern expressed as ETL to reemerge in a scenario with additional complexity, where the number of data sources and the data heterogeneity that needs to be supported by ETL drastically increases. In this scenario, issues with data quality and trustworthiness may strongly impact the data utility for end-users. The barriers involved in building an ETL infrastructure under the complexity and scale of the available Web-based data supply scenario, demands the deﬁnition of strategies which can provide data quality warranties and also minimize the effort associated with data management. In this context, provenance, the representation of artifacts, processes and agents behind a piece of information, becomes a fundamental element of the data infrastructure. Provenance have a large spectrum of applications including documentation & reproducibility and data quality assessment & trustworthiness and consistency-checking & semantic reconciliation. However, in an environment where data is produced and consumed by different systems, the representation of provenance should be made interoperable across systems. Standardization eﬀorts towards the convergence into a common provenance model generated the Open Provenance Model (OPM). OPM provides a basic description of provenance which allows interoperability on the level of workﬂow structure. The deﬁnition of this common provenance ground allows systems with different provenance representations to share at least a workﬂow-level semantics (the causal dependencies between artifacts, processes and the intervention of agents). OPM, however, is not intended to be a complete provenance model, but demands the complementary use of additional provenance models in order to enable uses of provenance which requires higher level of semantic interoperability. Cogs is an ETL Provenance Vocabulary which extends the workflow semantics provided by OPM and Prov-O, allowing the description of ETL processes and objects. The Cogs vocabulary can be used to describe data transformations in general, outside the scope of ETL tools and practices. The core objective of the vocabulary is to improve the level of semantic interoperability of data transformation provenance descriptors, building upon the OPM and Prov-O standardization efforts.

1690	Data Cube Vocabulary	http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/	There are many situations where it would be useful to be able to publish multi-dimensional data, such as statistics, on the web in such a way that it can be linked to related data sets and concepts. The Data Cube vocabulary provides a means to do this using the W3C RDF (Resource Description Framework) standard. The model underpinning the Data Cube vocabulary is compatible with the cube model that underlies SDMX (Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange), an ISO standard for exchanging and sharing statistical data and metadata among organizations.

It is maintained by the University of Oslo Science Library in collaboration with the University of Bergen Science Library, and covers mainly the physical sciences, mathematics and computer science. As of January 2015, the vocabulary consists of approximately 15 000 single concept headings, and about 16 000 compound headings (""subject strings""), published as open data for everyone to use freely."
1697	REEEP Climate Smart Thesaurus		The Climate Tagger is backed by the expansive Climate Compatible Development Thesaurus, a vast catalogue of specialized terminology, including mapped links to synonyms and related terms, in five languages and across a range of sectors relevant for climate compatible development. REEEP began compiling the Climate Compatible Development Thesaurus (or Climate Thesaurus) in 2011 (...). The Climate Thesaurus is regularly updated and expanded to additional areas and languages, and can be targeted to incorporate specific sectors on an as-needed basis. Updates to the Climate Thesaurus are automatically integrated into systems using Climate Tagger.
1698	Classification proficl @ ss	http://www.proficlass.de/front_content.php?idcat=6	The importance of e-business and electronic data has never been as important as today, regardless of whether it is a marketplace on the Internet, an eProcurement system, a shop or catalog creation software - every participant at PVH uses electronic data almost every day, (...) The consequences of this lack of standardization: Just about every data delivery has to be controlled manually and adapted to almost everyone And the classification standard proficl @ ss, which has been developed in 2003 and has since then been regularly updated, makes this unevenness and the associated handling problems in the PVH ultimately a thing of the past, because all relevant information, eg technical product data, pictures, short - and Langtexte to de N individual products, can be transferred without a layout and imported into the database by the data receiver (customer, dealer, Internet marketplace).
1699	Classification Digital Library	http://fkdigbib.de/	"The purpose of this classification is to organize media of all kinds, which is of interest to the topic of"" digital library "", but the scope of application is not restricted to virtual or digital libraries, but conventional libraries can also use this classification without problems. ) The classification is intended to fully meet the needs of specialized libraries, and has been designed to be linked to already established universal classifications, in order to subdivide the topic of 'digital library'. The compatibility with the Dewey Decimal Classification was emphasized (...). Therefore: it is hierarchical, reflects this hierarchy in the notation and has a purely numeric notation."
17	Government of Canada Core Subject Thesaurus	http://www.thesaurus.gc.ca/recherche-search/thes-eng.html	The Government of Canada Core Subject Thesaurus is a bilingual thesaurus consisting of terminology which represents all the fields treated in information resources of the Government of Canada. It contains 4,801 terms in English and 4,868 in French, including 2,180 preferred terms in each language. All fields of knowledge are represented in the thesaurus, to varying degrees. Because of the great variety of subjects covered by the thesaurus, its terminology is rather general. By design, it does not include specialized terminology used in specific and limited disciplines. The tool is primarily intended for content managers, librarians, indexers and metadata developers in federal departments and agencies who must select controlled subject terms to index Government of Canada Web resources. In the Treasury Board Standard on Metadata, the Government of Canada Core Subject Thesaurus is identified as the preferred source of controlled vocabulary for that purpose. Using the CST will help to reduce the duplication of effort in creating a variety of controlled vocabularies in the Government of Canada, as well as increase the interoperability of government web sites.
170	Surface Water Classifications	http://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/water-resources/planning/classification-standards/classifications	Surface Water Classifications are designations applied to surface water bodies, such as streams, rivers and lakes, which define the best uses to be protected within these waters (for example swimming, fishing, drinking water supply) and carry with them an associated set of water quality standards to protect those uses. Surface water classifications are one tool that state and federal agencies use to manage and protect all streams, rivers, lakes, and other surface waters in North Carolina. Classifications and their associated protection rules may be designed to protect water quality, fish and wildlife, or other special characteristics. Each classification has associated standards that are used to determine if the designated uses are being protected.
1700	AGU Index Terms		Index terms are a key part of AGU's strategy for categorizing and electronic distribution of journal articles, books, meeting abstracts, and e-mail alerts. They are used in database searches, in subject indices, and in identifying articles for inclusion in AGU Personal Choice journals.
1701	AODN Discovery Parameter Vocabulary	https://vocabs.ands.org.au/aodn-discovery-parameter-vocabulary	This controlled vocabulary covers parameter terms and their descriptions. It can be used for marking up Marine Community Profile metadata and a classified version of the terms is used to control faceted searching in the AODN/IMOS portal.
1702	Metis Classification	http://metisinnovations.com/	Metis is a flexible, intuitive and child-friendly system of library categorization. It uses whole language, visual cues, and logic that reflects children's own experiences. It puts the child in the center of his or her own search. Our decision to create Metis is a result of our progressive approach to education and the library. The system isn't a cut-down version of adult thinking. Kids feel empowered to navigate the library because it is organized in a way that they understand. Metis increases the success rate of finding books, which fosters self-reliance and produces joyous discovery. We have named the system in honor of the crafty Titan who is the mother of Athena and the eternal source of good advice for Zeus.
1703		http://cairogazetteer.fr/invisu/page/ark:/67717/b8b2b220-4f23-4d81-95d0-dbce50dde2c6	The Cairo Gazetteer is a tool for the identification and indexing of documentary collections relating to Cairo's monuments, which raise difficulties of treatment because of the many variants resulting from the transliteration into Latin characters of Arabic toponyms. The form of a concordance table which lists the orthographic variants of the names of the monuments, this trilingual reference frame (French, Arabic, English), in SKOS format, identifies, describes and locates the 600 classified buildings in Cairo.

1708	Subject Taxonomy Books University Library Paderborn	https://data.ub.uni-paderborn.de/fachsystematik/	"The 'Fachsystematik Bücher' of the University Library of Paderborn (UB) serves as a layout for the creation of the book inventory in the freehand areas of the UB. Since it is possible to search in the catalog for individual 'system sites' of the Fachsystematik, it offers one of several possibilities of the Factual research on the stock of printed books in the UB. The subject system is based on the 'Gesamt-Hochschul-Bibliotheks-Systematik' (GHBS), which (...) was further developed by the libraries together with the Hochschulbibliothekszentrum in Köln (hbz). This cooperative further development was carried out on the basis of a majority decision of the o.g. Libraries in October 2004. In essence, this decision was based on the fact that the systematics of the individual libraries had evolved significantly over time, despite the commitment to the co-operative part of the care, and that a common approach to the revision required in some areas was not appropriate. Since autumn 2004, the UB Paderborn has continually been adapting its 'Fachsystematik Bücher' to the development of science in general and the teaching and research foci of the University of Paderborn in particular. It has, inter alia, Two fundamental aspects: on the one hand, in the case of adaptations, it is necessary to maintain the character of specialist systematics as a ""pragmatic universal regulation"" which takes into account all scientific disciplines. On the other hand, changes have to be critically examined under cost-benefit aspects in each individual case, as they are usually associated with very personnel-intensive workflows. In total there are 35 individual systems. Each individual system has a number assigned to it in ascending line from 01 to 04, 07, etc. to 94, which also represents the layout scheme when the journals are drawn up. The compartment numbers or the notation from three to four uppercase letters of the individual system locations are part of the signature system of the UB. The subject system is an enumerative system. The notation range is from AAA to ZZZZ (three- or four-letter code). This framework has not been fully exploited so that there are limited and limited quotation quotas within and between individual systems. If the individual systems are compared with one another, subject systems such as 'other philologies' and 'other fields of technology' are excluded, since they do not concern a single subject by name. Rather, they are a summary of several disciplines. The subject system 'Authors' Humanities' also stands out from the other individual subject systems; It is not primarily organized according to factual criteria, but first of all arranged in a very coherent chronology (antiquity, medieval and modern times), and on the second level of organization alphabetically according to the names of authors from the field of humanities. In addition to the system locations, the subject system also contains references (as 'See-Referral' or 'See-Referral'); It can be referred to points within the same subject system as well as to other individual systematics. In the case of the latter, the abbreviated name of this subject system is also indicated for quick orientation. The abbreviated name usually consists of the three initial letters of the subject systematics and can be seen from the table of contents."
1709	Animal Disease Thesaurus	http://hdl.handle.net/2027/umn.31951002847366c	The first section is an alphabetical arrangement of keyword terms. In this section the first 6 digits represent the code number, and the next 2 digits indicate the category in the hierarchical section of the Thesaurus. Digits are followed on the same line by corresponding keywords. The first word is the coded keyword term or concept, followed by a slash //, which separates the coded work from its next hierarchical level. (One, two, or three level hierarchical arrangement.) The second section is the hierarchical arrangement of the coded terms. It is divided into 10 categories. Each category has up to 3 levels of keyword terms or concepts, each level intended from the preceding level and preceded by a code number.

1710	AODN Organisation Category Vocabulary	https://vocabs.ands.org.au/aodn-organisation-category-vocabulary	An AODN controlled vocabulary describing organisation categories for classifying organisational entities.
1711	Motif-Index of Folk-Literature	https://sites.ualberta.ca/~urban/Projects/English/Motif_Index.htm	Folklorists also use motif to refer to the recognizable and consistently repeated story elements (e.g., common characters, objects, actions, and events) that are used in the traditional plot structures, or tale types, of many stories and folktales. These motifs, which Dr. Margaret Read Macdonald calls 'each small part of a tale,' (.) were indexed in 1932 by Stith Thompson and published as the Motif-lndex of Folk-Literature. (.) Thompson built upon the research of Antti Aarne (and the tale type index he created) when he compiled, classified, and numbered the traditional motifs of the mostly European folktale types in Aarne’s index and then cross referenced those motifs with Aarne’s tale types (Dundes). (.) Folklorist Alan Dundes explains that Stith Thompson’s 'six-volume Motif-Index of Folk-Literature and the Aarne-Thompson tale type index constitute two of the most valuable tools in the professional folklorist's arsenal of aids for analysis'.
1712	ATU Types of Folktales		In 'The Types of International Folktales', the 'ATU Catalogue' edited by Hans-Jörg Uther (2004), ATU numbers replace AT numbers. And ATU (from the surname initials of Aarne, Thompson, and Uther) allows 'the type numbers that have been in use for nearly one hundred years [to] remain unchanged,' says Uther. To allow that and to accomplish that are two different things, though, for at least one Norwegian folktale that is well over a hundred years, is missing completely in the new ATU system. Its old AT number (211*) has disappeared. Another side to the revision is that the overall content of various types of tales has been changed, in both small ways and more comprehensively. And such changes mean that old 'AT umbrellas' (numbers) for the types of tales, do not serve as well as before as classification devices in every case, for example in many Norwegian folktales I have checked and commented on in Norwegian. (.) However, the new ATU-types are now the classification devices in force.
172	Optics Classification and Indexing Scheme	http://www.opticsinfobase.org/submit/ocis/	OCIS provides a flexible, comprehensive classification system for all optical author input and user retrieval needs. OCIS has a two-level hierarchical structure containing 36 main headers and approximately 1100 subcategories. OSA authors, presenters, and reviewers use OCIS to classify and index journal articles, meeting abstracts and presentations, and areas of research interest and expertise.
173		http://disco-tools.eu/disco2_portal/	DISCO, the European Dictionary of Skills and Competences, is an online thesaurus that currently covers more than 90,000 skills and competence terms and approximately 8,000 example phrases. Available in ten European languages, DISCO is one of the largest collections of its kind in the education and labour market. The DISCO Thesaurus offers a multilingual and peer-reviewed terminology for the classification, description and translation of skills and competences. It is compatible with European tools such as Europass, ESCO, EQF, and ECVET, and supports the international comparability of skills and competences in applications such as personal CVs and e-portfolios, job advertisements and matching, and qualification and learning outcome descriptions.
174	Product Types Ontology	http://www.productontology.org/	This service provides ca. 300,000 precise definitions for types of product or services that extend the schema.org and GoodRelations standards for e-commerce markup. You can use this ontology to describe any object for which a matching entry in the English Wikipedia exists. Thanks to the many links between the multiple language editions of Wikipedia, you can search for the best class in your favorite language, e.g. in the German or Italian Wikipedia, and then click on the English translation on the left-hand side to get to the matching page in the English Wikipedia.
1743	Roget's Thesaurus		Roget's Thesaurus is composed of six primary classes. (...) Each class is composed of multiple divisions and then sections. This may be conceptualized as a tree containing over a thousand branches for individual 'meaning clusters' or semantically linked words. Although these words are not strictly synonyms, they can be viewed as colours or connotations of a meaning or as a spectrum of a concept. One of the most general words is chosen to typify the spectrum as its headword, which labels the whole group. Roget's schema of classes and their subdivisions is based on the philosophical work of Leibniz (...), itself following a long tradition of epistemological work starting with Aristotle. Some of Aristotle's Categories are included in Roget's first class 'abstract relations'.

175	Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale	http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php	The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is a 1 to 5 rating based on a hurricane's sustained wind speed. This scale estimates potential property damage. Hurricanes reaching Category 3 and higher are considered major hurricanes because of their potential for significant loss of life and damage. Category 1 and 2 storms are still dangerous, however, and require preventative measures. In the western North Pacific, the term 'super typhoon' is used for tropical cyclones with sustained winds exceeding 150 mph.
1750	Gazetteer of British Place Names		The Gazetteer provides an exhaustive Place Name Index to Great Britain, containing over 50,000 entries. It lists the historic county and the main administrative areas in which each place lies. It forms a valuable resource for those working in the media, tourism, heritage, publishing or education. It is also of great value for local and family historians.
1751	Spatial Synoptic Classification	http://sheridan.geog.kent.edu/ssc.html	The SSC is based solely on surface based observations at an individual station. Four-times daily observations of temperature, dew point, wind, pressure, and cloud cover are incorporated into the model. It does not take upper-level conditions into account, and does not concern itself with the origin of the air above a station, though there are obvious correlations. Hence, the SSC is most properly called a weather type classification and not an air mass classification system.  Within the SSC scheme, weather-type characteristics change from station to station and day to day. Thus, a Moist Tropical weather type is hotter and more humid in the southeastern US, nearer its source region, than in the northeastern US, after it has modified somewhat. Similarly, MT is warmer at all locations in July than in January. (...)  On this website, SSC 'calendars' are available for nearly 400 stations across the US, Canada, and parts of Europe. The European calendars are limited to 1974-2000, but the US and Canadian calendars generally cover a station's total period of record. A total of over 8,000,000 days have been classified across all of these stations. The SSC is also being continually updated - you can see yesterday's (preliminary) classifications and today's and tomorrow's forecast classifications as well. The 'official' SSC calendar for a year will be added to this site within a couple of months of the calendar year's end.
1754	EMA Templates – Names of EU-EEA countries	http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Regulatory_and_procedural_guideline/2009/10/WC500004445.pdf	The EMA (European Medicines Agency) provides information on the linguistic aspects of the product information for a medicine, which includes the summary of product characteristics, labelling and package leaflet. It explains the content that should be included in these documents, as well as standard headings and the most commonly used standard statements and terms in all official European Union languages plus Icelandic and Norwegian, and defines the format and layout for the product information. The European Medicines Agency has developed these templates and glossaries to provide applicants with practical advice on how to draw up the product information. The glossaries were created by manually processing these documents.
1756	Swedish Subject Headings	http://www.kb.se/katalogisering/Svenska-amnesord/	Swedish subject headings (SAO) is a controlled subject headings system containing 38 000 terms from all disciplines. The system has been around since 2000 and is used by most university libraries and many LIBRIS libraries. In Swedish subject headings, you can find subject headings to search library catalogs and other databases, and to index the literature and other materials.
1757	SMGloM	https://mathhub.info/mh/glossary	The SMGloM is a structured terminology for mathematics. It combines lexical information about the 'Words of Mathematics' (in multiple languages) with semantic information about their dependencies. Multiple services can be derived from this terminology, e.g. a classical glossary and a math dictionary.
1758	Aquo-lex	http://www.aquolex.nl/	"The Aquo-lex provides a"" default language ""that aims to prevent speech confusion between people and / or information systems. Errors that occur in data exchange often arise because of differences in meaning. Aquo-lex, the"" water dictionary "", contains approximately 7500 definitions for terms. The use of terms from Aquo lex and the corresponding definitions lead to better data exchange. The Aquo lex can be used in the following ways:     1. When compiling a report, use the terms as included in Aquo lex so that the reader of your report can find out what the term is.     2. When designing an information system, use the user interface and database terms that match the definitions in Aquo lex.     3. In addition, you can also search for the definition of a domain value in Aquo lex (for example, you can check which individual parameters a sum parameter is built up). You can consult the Aquo lex using the Aquo LOC tool (Aquo Lex and Object Catalog). In Aquo LOC, you can easily find terms and place them in their context, because the relationships between the terms are also displayed. For example, if you are looking for the term bridge, you will see in the Aquo OC next to the bridge definition that the bridge is a work of art and distinguishes between a fixed and a movable bridge. In addition, Aquo LOC offers the possibility to directly refer to the data."

176	Education terms	http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130123124929/http://www.education.gov.uk/vocabularies/educationtermsandtags	The A-Z of terms is the controlled vocabulary developed and maintained by the Department for Education. It was first developed in the 1980s and has been continually updated to reflect new topics and departmental responsibilities. It groups terms together so that when you search you can see the term that you are looking for in the context of other terms in the vocabulary - this helps you to browse for information. Terms are listed with all their relationships, plus a scope note (to help define a term and explain how it should be used) where necessary. This controlled vocabulary is used to tag content added to this website, so that when you look for terms through the A-Z of terms, you will also find the relevant content that has been assigned to those categories.
1760	A Women's Thesaurus		"The language of standard indexing and classification systems-terms used in most journals, libraries, filing systems, and databases-does not offer vocabulary consistently or sufficiently detailed and up-to-date to retrieve the wealth of resources available. Existing classifications frequently overlook emerging topics of special concern to women. As a result, important information is lumped under 'women' or is inaccessible. Prefixes and suffixes attached to terminology ostensibly gender neutral reflect implicitly male norms and define women in terms of their relationships to men (labels like ""nontraditional employment"" or ""unwed mothers""). Worse, by juxtaposition, indexing systems condition our response to important topics. Grouping lesbian issues and prostitution in categories of sexuality, for example, skews complex social, political, and personal concerns. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."
1761		http://homosaurus.org/	This is an International Thesaurus of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Index Terms that is currently used by https://www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net.

1765		http://www.johnbiggs.com.au/academic/solo-taxonomy/	As learning progresses it becomes more complex. SOLO, which stands for the Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome, is a means of classifying learning outcomes in terms of their complexity, enabling us to assess students’ work in terms of its quality not of how many bits of this and of that they got right. At first we pick up only one or few aspects of the task (unistructural), then several aspects but they are unrelated (multistructural), then we learn how to integrate them into a whole (relational), and finally, we are able to generalised that whole to as yet untaught applications (extended abstract). The diagram lists verbs typical of each such level. SOLO can be used not only in assessment, but in designing the curriculum in terms of the learning outcomes intended, which is helpful in implementing constructive alignment. SOLO can also explain why those who use low complexity arguments in political or marital disputes usually win – in the short term. But in politics that’s all you need.
17656	Glossary of Contemporary Art	http://sli.webs.uvigo.es/arquivos/Glosario_da_Arte_en_gl_es.pdf	This glossary was born of the need to expand the repertoires terminographic about contemporary art that included the galician as a working language. Today, art is to acquire a big push in India, mainly thanks to the activity of new museums, galleries and exhibition halls that show the work of younger artists or innovative on the international scene. however, translators and professionals working with texts on contemporary art are an empty terminográfico when seeking upgraded features that help them to the translation of texts and to include the concepts modern, possibly adapted to the new regulations galician 2003.
1766	Bloom's Taxonomy		"Bloom's taxonomy is a way of distinguishing the fundamental questions within the education system. It is named after Benjamin Bloom, who chaired the committee of educators that devised the taxonomy. He also edited the first volume of the standard text, Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: The Classification of Educational Goals. (...) Although named after Bloom, the publication of Taxonomy of Educational Objectives followed a series of conferences from 1949 to 1953, which were designed to improve communication between educators on the design of curricula and examinations. (...) The first volume of the taxonomy, Handbook I: Cognitive (Bloom et al. 1956) was published in 1956. ""Handbook II: Affective"" (Krathwohl, Bloom & Masia 1965)Simpson (1966), Harrow (1972) and Dave (1975). (...) A revised version of the taxonomy for the cognitive domain was created in 2000. (...) Bloom’s taxonomy serves as the backbone of many teaching philosophies, in particular those that lean more towards skills rather than content. (...) These educators would view content as a vessel for teaching skills. The emphasis on higher-order thinking inherent in such philosophies is based on the top levels of the taxonomy including analysis, evaluation, synthesis and creation. Bloom’s taxonomy can be used as a teaching tool to help balance assessment and evaluative questions in class, assignments and texts to ensure all orders of thinking are exercised in student’s learning."

1767	CDISC Clinical Research Glossary	http://www.cdisc.org/cdisc-glossary	The CDISC Glossary (...) defines terms commonly used in clinical research (including acronyms, abbreviations, and initials). The Glossary serves the community of clinical researchers by selecting and defining terms pertaining to clinical research, particularly eClinical investigations, sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry or a federal agency. Note this CDISC Glossary is NOT comprehensive for all words bearing on human health, medicine, or laboratory methods. The Glossary includes references and links to other glossaries such as regulatory dictionaries and to health-related controlled terminologies known to be useful in conducting clinical research, including the CDISC Terminology Project. Glossary terms are organized alphabetically, by first word, according to the opinion of the Glossary Project Team concerning most common usage in clinical research. Thus 'source document verification' would appear under 'source', not 'verification'. The Glossary follows the practice of preceding certain terms with the letter 'e' to denote that they pertain to electronic or Web implementation.

The columns are subdivided into seven slices (layers) into groups of 10 (from 10 to 70) Significance (Exceptions are the environmental areas UR = 'environmental law' and UA = 'general and over Environmental issues'). In particular, this consistently uniform slicing is intended to facilitate the assertion of environmental classification and thus its application. The actual classification takes place at the level of these discs (= environmental classes).

17740	Star Trek Planetary Classification	http://sttff.net/planetaryclass.html	A planet is a celestial body in orbit around a star or stellar remnants, that has sufficient mass for self-gravity and is nearly spherical in shape. A planet must not share its orbital region with other bodies of significant size (except for its own satellites), and must be below the threshold for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium. If a celestial body meets those requirements, it is considered a planet; at that point, the planet is further classified by its atmosphere and surface conditions into one of twenty-two categories.
17741	Star Trek Nebula Classification	http://sttff.net/ast/AST_nebulaclassification.html	A nebula is an interstellar cloud of dust, gas, and plasma, where star formation usually occurs.

17744	Star Trek Spectral Classification	http://sttff.net/ast/spectralclassification.html	Stars can generally be classified by their color. A purple star is always Class O, a yellow star is always Class G. However, there can be vast differences within each class. Most Class M stars are tiny and don't emit much light... however, many K- and G-type stars can evolve into red giants. That makes them Class M, but they are NOTHING like the tiny stars that make up the vast majority of Class M stars. Since most stars spend most of their lives on the Main Sequence, the descriptions on this page can be applied to the majority of stars. The oddballs and outsiders don't necessarily fit the exact parameters here (and will be discussed elsewhere), but even the oddballs conform to the interstellar color scheme, so even a blue oddball is class B.
17745	Yosemite Decimal System		The Yosemite Decimal System (YDS) is a three-part system used for rating the difficulty of walks, hikes, and climbs.

Originally the system was a single-part classification system. In recent years, Grade and Protection categories were added to the system. The new categories do not apply to every climb and usage varies widely. The grades are subjective, reflecting the first ascenscionist's opinion of the climb's difficulty. There are also systematic regional differences in grading within the United States.

J. Coates by the Council of the British National Bibliography to organize the content of the British Catalogue of Music. The published schedule (1960) was considerably expanded by Patrick Mills of the British Library up until its use was abandoned in 1998. Entries in the catalogue were organized by BCM classmark from the catalogue's inception in 1957 until 1982. From that year the British Catalogue of Music (which from 1974 onward was published by The British Library) was organized instead by Dewey Decimal Classification number, though BCM classmarks continued to be added to entries up to the 1998 annual cumulation.

17760	RCUK Subject Classification	http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/efficiency/researchadmin/harmonisation/	PRGPG agreed that in the long term classification harmonisation across the whole higher education and research sector would be desirable and that the Research Councils should aim to achieve alignment over a period of a few years and would not adopt JACS at this stage, although JACS could be used for external reporting. With the exception of MRC (which has signed up to a UK-wide classification system for health research, the Health Research Classification System, HRCS, the hierarchical structure of which MRC considers cannot be accommodated within the RCUK structure) the Research Councils will initially seek to harmonise the classifications across the Councils. Two Classification workshops were organised, as a result of which the RCs have delivered to UK SBS enough defined structure and content to create the required three-level research classification and reviewer matching structure. The information which will be used to populate the top two levels of the structure are 90% accurate as agreed (apart from possible typos and stylistic considerations). There are, however, some duplications (some of which are intentional and some unintentional) that should ideally be reviewed. The third level of the hierarchy (Keys), required by EPSRC and BBSRC for reviewer matching are 90% compliant with the requirements of UK SBS. Unfortunately, the third level hierarchy (Keys) will not provide a reviewer matching functionality for EPSRC that is fit for purpose without further review. While the structure of the hierarchy is very unlikely to change over time, agreed changes will, inevitably, need to be made to data fields in the future and in the short term to Keys, to make them fit for purpose for reviewer matching. Attention will now be given to how this will be handled, given that PRGPG is not a standing group.
17761	Contributor Roles Taxonomy		A high-level classification of the diverse roles performed in the work leading to a published research output in the sciences. Its purpose to provide transparency in contributions to scholarly published work, to enable improved systems of attribution, credit, and accountability. (...) The classification includes, but is not limited to, traditional authorship roles. That is, these roles are not intended to define what constitutes authorship. Rather, the roles are intended to apply to all those who contribute to research that results in scholarly published works, and it is recommended that all tagged contributors be listed, whether they are formally listed as authors or named in acknowledgements. An individual contributor may be assigned multiple roles, and a given role may be assigned to multiple contributors. When there are multiple people serving in the same role, a degree of contribution may optionally be specified as ‘lead’, ‘equal’, or ‘supporting’. It is recommended that corresponding authors assume responsibility for role assignment, and that all contributors be given the opportunity to review and confirm assigned roles.

The publication will be available on the Agency's website, under the link 'Medicamentos.' The booklet contains the standardization of nomenclatures and concepts related to Pharmaceutical forms, administration routes and packaging of medicinal products to be used as a primary reference, especially in the registration and post-registration of medicines.Another important aspect is the abbreviations of technical characteristics, widely used in official publications. The concepts and nomenclatures should also be used in the package inserts and labels, in the information systems, in the certification of Good Manufacturing Practices and in other activities that require standardized information.The lack of standardization hinders the correct classification Two doctors Common understanding."

(...) The MIMO project has also involved the revision of the Hornbostel Sachs classification of musical instruments, with the main aim of classifying instruments such those in the new Electrophones class 5, invented since the publication of the original scheme of 1914 by Erich M. von Hornbostel and Curt Sachs. A number of scholars have at various times revised or extended the scheme. The MIMO consortium’s version is closely based on the revised version (classes 1-4) by Jeremy Montagu to whom the consortium owes a debt of gratitude for generously sharing with us with us all resources associated with it; (...). This version of classification has been incorporated within the databases of a number of the museums in the MIMO project.
17776	London Library Classification Scheme	http://londonlibrary.co.uk/ll-collections/books	The London Library has a unique and rather unorthodox classification scheme. Described as 'unusual but serviceable' by Alan Bell (Librarian of the London Library from 1993 to 2001), its application and maintenance are both a joy and a challenge. The scheme was devised by Sir Charles Theodore Hagberg Wright (1862-1940), Librarian of the London Library from 1893 until his death. (...): it was created on the principle of literary warrant, that is, it was designed around the books the Library held at the time. Like the scheme devised for the Library of Congress it was made to fit a particular collection with no thought of it ever being adopted by another library. LCC has since been adopted by many libraries, the London Library classification hasn’t had a comparable impact but it was adopted by the House of Commons Library where it continued to be used until 2000.
17777	Eating and Drinking Ability Classification System for Individuals with Cerebral Palsy	http://www.sussexcommunity.nhs.uk/get-involved/research/chailey-research/eating-drinking-classification.htm	We have developed a new Eating and Drinking Ability Classification System (EDACS) for people with cerebral palsy. EDACS describes five distinct levels of ability using the key features of safety and efficiency (...). Our new Eating and Drinking Ability Classification System (EDACS) offers an alternative to subjective terms such as mild and moderate and severe which have no agreed definition. We developed EDACS by consulting with people with cerebral palsy, parents and experts around the world. EDACS has been tested to see how easy and reliable it is when used by speech and language therapists and parents.
17778		http://amecorg.com/amecframework/home/supporting-material/taxonomy/#taxonomy-table	A wide range of models of PR and communication evaluation exist using a wide range of terms including inputs, outputs, outtakes, outflows, outgrowths, effects, results, and impact. An even wider range of metrics and methods for evaluation are proposed for each stage. The field is confusing for many practitioners. This page presents a taxonomy of evaluation tailored to strategic public communication – a taxonomy being a mapping of a field to produce a categorisation of concepts and terms – in short, to show where things go and where they fit in relation to each other. (...) A taxonomy is not the same as a model, as a taxonomy attempts to list ALL the main concepts, terms, metrics, methods, etc. in a field, while a model is an illustration of a specific program or activity to be applied in practice. However, models should be based on the concepts and methods identified as legitimate in the field and apply them appropriately. An important benefit of a taxonomy is that it puts concepts, metrics, methods, etc. in their right place – e.g., it avoids output metrics being confused with outcome metrics.

1779	Presentation system Informative Media	http://www.nbdbiblion.nl/product/pim	"PIM is an alphabetic word system (as opposed to a numerical hierarchical system such as SISO) that consists of two levels: categories ("" subject areas "") and keywords below.  There are 27 fixed categories (visible by icons). These subject areas are grouped into ten clusters (colors) of related subject areas. The clusters can be directional for the visitor and for the collection of collections in the library. (For example, the categories ""Hobbies"" and ""Sports and Games"" are both orange; Libraries can choose to draw them in close proximity).  The PIM keywords in principle correspond to the first keyword granted by Media Aanbod to the media based on the NBD Biblion Trefwoordenthesaurus. When publicly-friendly media presentation on the shelf demands, another or broader keyword will be assigned. If the PIM keyword is too long for the label, it breaks down in a ""logical"" location, so that two nouns occur. (For example: Organization Development becomes: Organization Development) The same keyword can occur in different categories. The category format and a specific assigned keyword determine the location on the shelf of a unique medium in a library collection."
17790	Pan-European Species directories Infrastructure	http://www.eu-nomen.eu/portal/	PESI provides standardised and authoritative taxonomic information by integrating and securing Europe’s taxonomically authoritative species name registers and nomenclators (name databases) and associated exper(tise) networks that underpin the management of biodiversity in Europe. PESI defines and coordinates strategies to enhance the quality and reliability of European biodiversity information by integrating the infrastructural components of four major community networks on taxonomic indexing into a joint work programme. This will result in functional knowledge networks of taxonomic experts and regional focal points, which will collaborate on the establishment of standardised and authoritative taxonomic (meta-) data. PESI will coordinate the integration and synchronisation of the European taxonomic information systems into a joint e-infrastructure and the set up of a common user-interface disseminating the pan-European checklists and associated user-services results. The organisation of national and regional focal point networks as projected not only assures the efficient access to local expertise, but is also important for the synergistic promotion of taxonomic standards throughout Europe, for instance to liaison with national governmental bodies on the implementation of European biodiversity legislations. PESI will provide a robust infrastructure to support the nomenclatural needs of European users and stakeholders. PESI will specifically address the issues of: pooling resources, standardisation, sustainability, accessibility and international cooperation.
17792	Prokaryotic Nomenclature Up-to-Date	https://www.dsmz.de/bacterial-diversity/prokaryotic-nomenclature-up-to-date.html	Prokaryotic Nomenclature up-to-date' is a compilation of all names of Bacteria and Archaea which have been validly published according to the Bacteriological Code since 1. Jan. 1980, and nomenclatural changes which have been validly published since. It will be updated with the publication of each new issue of the Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. (IJSEM).  'Prokaryotic Nomenclature up-to-date' is based on the work of N. Weiss and M. Kracht and is maintained by Dorothea Gleim who may be consulted on technical aspects (database resp. online access).
17793	ISO 3166 Country Codes	https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/	ISO 3166 is the International Standard for country codes and codes for their subdivisions. The purpose of ISO 3166 is to define internationally recognised codes of letters and/or numbers that we can use when we refer to countries and subdivisions. However, it does not define the names of countries – this information comes from United Nations sources (Terminology Bulletin Country Names and the Country and Region Codes for Statistical Use maintained by the United Nations Statistics Divisions).

17797	ETHNOLOGICAL DOCUMENT OF CHEMICAL TERMS	http://195.134.76.37/scinews/Reports/Rep_Etymol_lexicon.htm	Most of the chemical terms that have been collected come from foreign words, mainly Latin, many of which have Greek origin or similar word of common origin. It does not attempt to interpret or describe the term, with some exceptions. Also by way of exception, in some cases the historical context on which the creation of the word was based is developed. The words that are said to belong to broader fields, such as mineralogy, biochemistry, pharmacology and some commercial products. There are no words of obvious Greek origin (eg lithium, choline), but there are some terms derived from relatively unknown or otherwise ancient Greek (eg cobalt, theobromine). Wherever possible, the reasoning of the empirical name is justified, since it is not obvious, even for some common word terms (eg rule, codon).

17799	Biological Collections Ontology	https://github.com/BiodiversityOntologies/bco	The Biological Collections Ontology (BCO) is an application ontology developed as part of the Biocode Commons project, within the OBO Foundry framework. The goal of the BCO is to support the interoperability of biodiversity data, including data on museum collections, environmental/metagenomic samples, and ecological surveys. The BCO covers distinctions between individuals, organisms, voucher specimens, lots, samples, the relations between these entities, and the processes governing the creation and use of 'samples'. Also within scope are properties including collector, location, time, storage environment, containers, institution, and collection identifiers.
178	Education Thesaurus	http://www.cdc.qc.ca/multites_fr.htm	The revised and corrected 2001 edition of the thesaurus has 3,889 terms, ie 1,855 descriptors and 2,034 non-descriptors (synonyms and quasi-synonyms), followed by a qualifier to clarify the meaning of the descriptor. : Compétition (Psychologie) This is an integral part of the descriptor and must therefore be used with it when indexing or researching The purpose of this thesaurus is to assist the personnel of the documentation centers and the libraries of the milieu To organize their collection and to index their documentation. It can also be used as a research tool for online research.
1780	Keyword Thesaurus	http://www.nbdbiblion.nl/product/abonnement-trefwoordenthesaurus	The NBD | Biblion Trefwoordenthesaurus is an automated subject termination system for collections in public libraries, based on the terms assigned to NBD | Biblion's bibliographic products. In this thesaurus, all NBD | Biblion approved release terms for all media types are included . This has the advantage that the term of the term is consistent, that is, users are not confronted with different terms for the same understanding. By networking, libraries can consult each other's catalogs and exchange bibliographic data. Central cataloging, such as the Common Automated Cataloging System (GGC) of OCLC plays an important role in this. Libraries with a regional support function, for example, make use of terms from the NBD | Biblion Trefwoordenthesaurus for the subject termination of their title descriptions in the GGC. They regularly make proposals for n Old terms. NBD | Biblion takes care of the tuning and management of the thesaurus as the central public library catalog of public libraries. The thesaurus terminals may also be available for inclusion in (part) thesauri that can be used for the subject termination in specific (bibliographic) products. This is possible by applying so-called type indicators that indicate which file or product will be assigned the termination terms.
17800	Phenotypic Quality Ontology	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/PATO	Phenotypic qualities (properties). This ontology can be used in conjunction with other ontologies such as GO or anatomical ontologies to refer to phenotypes. Examples of qualities are red, ectopic, high temperature, fused, small, edematous and arrested.
17802	Extensible Observation Ontology	https://github.com/NCEAS/oboe/	The Extensible Observation Ontology (OBOE) is a formal ontology for capturing the semantics of scientific observation and measurement. The ontology supports researchers to add detailed semantic annotations to scientific data, thereby clarifying the inherent meaning of scientific observations. (...) OBOE can characterize the context of an observation (e.g., space and time), as well as dependencies such as nested experimental observations. It includes an extensive set of unit definitions (e.g., grams of carbon per liter of seawater), and can facilitate automatic unit conversions (e.g., pounds to kilograms). OBOE can be easily extended to create Entities and Characteristics for specific research domains, making it both broadly applicable and highly customizable. OBOE is being used to improve data interpretation, facilitate reuse, and create precise and effective systems for data search and discovery.
17803	EUNIS Habitat Classification	http://eunis.eea.europa.eu/habitats.jsp	The EUNIS habitat classification is a comprehensive pan-European system to facilitate the harmonised description and collection of data across Europe through the use of criteria for habitat identification. It is hierarchical and covers all types of habitat types from natural to artificial, from terrestrial to freshwater and marine.
17804	Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard	https://www.cmecscatalog.org/	The Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS) provides a national framework for organizing information about coasts and oceans and their living systems. It provides a structure for developing and synthesizing data so that ecosystems can be identified, characterized, and mapped in a standard way across regional and national boundaries. CMECS also supports status and trend monitoring activities, policy development, restoration planning, and fisheries management. The standard complements existing wetland and upland classification systems. The six components of the classification standard represent the different aspects of the seascape (water column, geoform, substrate, biotic communities, biogeographic setting, and aquatic setting), starting with the broadest systems (marine, estuarine, and lacustrine) and narrowing to the most detailed physical and biological elements associated with a specific habitat type (biotic community). CMECS is periodically updated to reflect the best science and the needs of the coastal management communities. The framework of a dynamic standard process has been developed to receive input from researchers and users of the standard and to accomplish modifications to the classification system.
17805	CoRIS Glossary	http://www.coris.noaa.gov/glossary/	The CoRIS glossary contains terms concerned with ecology, biogeography, evolution, taxonomy, morphology, physiology, cell and molecular biology, genetics, mapping, development, fisheries, oceanography, geosciences, conservation programs, remote-sensing, physics, chemistry, and data and information management.
17806	Harvard Spectral Classification Scheme	http://www.star.ucl.ac.uk/~pac/spectral_classification.html	The modern stellar spectral classification scheme (also known as the Harvard Spectral Classification Scheme) was created by Annie Jump Cannon through her examination of spectra from 1918 to 1924. Originally, the scheme used capital letters running alphabetically, but was later reordered to reflect the surface temperatures of stars. In order of decreasing temperature, these types were O, B, A, F, G, K and M. Three additional categories also in the scheme: R, N, and S types, were later realized to represent stars with peculiar heavy-metal abundances. Other types (Q for novae, W for Wolf-Rayet stars, etc) are not encountered frequently. According to astronomical myth, Henry Norris Russell suggested the following mnemonic to assist students in remembering the scheme: Oh Be A Fine Girl, Kiss Me!
17807	Taxonomy of Horror Sub-Genres	https://openivorytower.org/taxonomy/	I’ve broken the horror genre down into 10 sub-genres and 3 additional non-sub-genre classifications. Each page includes a full breakdown of the category with descriptions for each classification. Additionally, each classification includes a list of films that exemplify that particular corner of the horror genre. This is an ongoing project, so individual pages and lists will open as I complete them.

Development and acquisition talk can be another language to some. Below we will cover some of the most common terms that screenwriters may come across. Terms that are most commonly utilized in development phases of Hollywood. While you’ve likely heard them before, it’s important to understand the meaning, the usage, and what it means for your own script and writing in question.

At its launch CRRO provides access to six online collections containing over 20,000 specimens of Republican coinage. The description of coin types provided here is based on Michael Crawford's 1974 publication Roman Republican Coinage (RRC), which is still the primary typology used for the identification of Roman Republican coin types. Since its publication in 1974 there have been significant revisions to the dating of the series following the discovery of new hoards, but no attempt has been made to reflect these or make any other amendments to the published typology at this stage. The descriptions for these coins are based on the typology set out in RRC, but have been modified to meet the standards of the British Museum’s collection management system by Eleanor Ghey and Ian Leins. These were previously published in Ghey and Leins 2010, which forms an update to the 1910 catalogue of the collection by Grueber. Additional types not in the British Museum’s collection were added to this database by Richard Witschonke of the ANS.

1791	Irish Public Service Thesaurus	http://www.gov.ie/webstandards/metastandards/pst/default.htm	The Public Service Thesaurus (PST) has been developed as a list of descriptors, or controlled vocabulary, by which public sector resources may be indexed. It was developed to facilitate public sector compliance with the Irish Public Service Metadata Standard (IPSMS), and in so doing to enhance the capacity of public sector organisaitons to make their resources accessible and visible to their client base. Compliance can be achieved by using appropriate terms from the vocabulary in conjunction with the mandatory DC.Subject element. The structure of the PST is such as to ensure ease of navigation around the vocabulary. It is represented at the top level by fourteen separate categories based on the wide areas of interest and involvement of public sector organisations. These top-level cateogries subdivide into second-level categories and so forth, each level in turn listing more specific subject sub-divisions. Many terms in the PST have been posted upwards in order to 1) limit the number of terms available for indexing, and consequently keep the thesaurus to a manageable size, and 2) to ensure as far as is practicable that resources sharing a common theme are returned together. This implies that the degree of specificity of terms available as indexing terms has been restricted. The PST, as an information retrieval thesaurus, is largely concerned with grouping like subject matter together, rather than allowing the naming of a particular object to the exclusion of others. In summary, a (preferred) term should be general enough that it might be used to index a number of items.

17915	The Design Intent Ontology	https://w3id.org/dio	The Design Intent Ontology (DIO) is a generic ontology that provides the conceptualisation needed to capture the knowledge generated during various phases of the overall design lifecycle. It provides definitions for design artifacts such as requirements, designs, design issues, solutions, justifications and evidence and relationships between them to represent the design process and how these things lead to design outcomes. It draws upon the paradigms of IBIS(Issue Based Information System), argumentation and design rationale. It is linked to W3C PROV by defining the actors in the design process as PROV agents and the design artifacts themselves are PROV entities. However DIO uses a modualrised version of PROV-O, based on Syntactic locality. DIO makes few assumptions about the design process used as the definitions of these activities properly belongs in the software lifecycle and data lifecycle models. The Figure below illustrates the conceptual entities in DIO and their relationships.

1792	Law & Environment Ontology	http://leo.informea.org/	LEO aims to provide an agreed to semantic standard for any institution or organization that collects and manages data, information and knowledge in the field of Environmental Law and Governance. The development of a semantic Ontology for Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) and International Environmental Law was identified as a priority for MEA Secretariats and UNEP at the first meeting of the MEA Information and Knowledge Management (IKM) Initiative. Members to the MEA IKM Initiative agreed on the need for a ‘controlled vocabulary’ to allow for easier searching, locating and retrieving of MEA information such as decisions by MEA governing bodies and meeting documents, reports and national plans. Generous financial support from the European Union provided for the review and enhancement of the draft InforMEA glossary through a Multi-Stakeholder process. The MEA IKM Initiative identified the IUCN Environmental Law Centre as collaborator in the development of the next version of the vocabulary and chose the FAO’s VOCbench system as the platform for the development and maintenance of the vocabulary. The IKM Initiative also reached out to organizations involved in the development of thesauri, such as the European Environment Agency’s GEMET, the ECOLEX and the FAOlex glossary.

1795	EAGLE Vocabulary Material	https://www.eagle-network.eu/voc/material.html	This hierarchic Vocabulary relies on the definitions of the Simplified Petrography in Salzburg. Another classification can be found in CIL Material Glossar. No Definitions can therefore be found here. Most of the Alternative Terms in Bulgarian, Turkish, Croatian, Suomi, Arabic and Modern Greek come from the EpiDoc Consortium efforts. The vocabulary is hierarchically designed to allow for both precise and generic definition, as well as for several types of uncertainty. In many cases, for example for precious/exotic materials (onyx, gold, etc.) precision is possible and desirable but for most banal materials only basic distinctions will generally be possible. In many cases scholars in epigraphy do not seek to decided whether a base was of Proconnesian or Thasian marble, nor to decide exactly what kind of stone the local material was (generally a form of limestone), in such cases, according to us, we shall be able to be as precise as possible, but the best practice is to allow for different levels of depth of the information which might be meaningful only in some cases. A result of this approach has also been that this vocabulary should also be a fairly complete list of possible material on which an inscription from antiquity can be found. Many problems are involved with this kind of classification as well. 'Arcilla' for example is not in the same 'class' as 'terracotta, inscribed brick, etc', because it pertains to the material in which the inscription was written or carved in, that is, like 'stone, metal or wood'. There are also specific terms which could be assimilated but are not, like 'Lumaquela', the local name for the stone in which most of the inscriptions from Tarraco were carved in.

1796	Library of Congress Medium of Performance Thesaurus for Music	http://id.loc.gov/authorities/performanceMediums.html	Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) has long included headings that represent the genre or form of musical works in combination with the mediums of performance (e.g., Sonatas (Trombone and organ); Concertos (Bassoon, clarinet, English horn, flute)), as well as headings that represent the mediums of performance alone (e.g., Bass clarinet and piano music). The structure of the headings can sometimes be of marginal utility to researchers, who may be most interested in finding music for a particular combination of instruments and are less focused on the genre of the music. Over the coming year, the concepts in the existing LC subject headings will be broken into their component parts. The forms and genres of musical works will be included in Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms for Library and Archival Materials (LCGFT) in 2014 or early 2015. The mediums of performance will be contained in the Library of Congress Medium of Performance Thesaurus for Music (LCMPT). When LCMPT and LCGFT terms for music are both implemented, the LC subject headings will cease to be assigned in new cataloging and will eventually be cancelled. LCMPT is a stand-alone vocabulary that provides terminology to describe the instruments, voices, etc., used in the performance of musical works. (...) The initial 802 LCMPT terms are based chiefly on existing LC subject headings, but some additional terms that do not already appear in LCSH have also been included. Authorized terms and references in LCMPT generally consist of single words and phrases, but parenthetical qualifiers are occasionally employed to differentiate among homonyms. All terms and references are in the singular form and are lowercased unless they are proper nouns (e.g., flute; saxophone ensemble; but Irish harp) The thesaurus has three broadest terms: ensemble, instrument, and performer. Each of the other terms is hierarchically subordinate to one or more of these terms and exhibits the class/class member relationship. Most of the authorized terms have Used For (UF) references for synonyms. Scope notes are also provided in many cases, and may describe the medium’s physical structure, the time period in which it was popular, and/or its geographic origin.

1797	Library of Congress Demographic Group Terms		This vocabulary will be used to describe the creators of, and contributors to, resources, and also the intended audience of resources. It will be created and maintained by the Policy and Standards Division, and be distinct from the other vocabularies that are maintained by that division: Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH), Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms for Library and Archival Materials (LCGFT), and the Library of Congress Medium of Performance Thesaurus for Music (LCMPT). (...) The development of LCDGT is necessitated by two circumstances: the genre/form project and the growing popularity of faceted displays and searching. The genre/form project formed the original impetus for creating a demographic terms vocabulary. Some LC subject headings—most notably the form headings for literature—include demographic information (e.g., Children’s stories, American, in which stories is the form, children are the audience demographic, and American, the creator demographic). The use of LCSH form headings for works of literature will be phased out as LC genre/form terms for literature are implemented, necessitating another method for bringing out the audience and creator/contributor information. (LCSH form headings will still be assigned to works about literature. New discovery interfaces also make a new vocabulary desirable. Subject headings such as Children’s stories, American are assigned to works about American children’s stories, and also to works that are American children’s stories, so the computer cannot distinguish between the two types of works. LCGFT began to ameliorate this situation by allowing for a genre/form search, separate from a subject search. Users often want to know, though, what works a library has by a particular group (e.g., novels by lawyers), or for a particular group (e.g., handbooks for nurses). The demographic term vocabulary will fill the latter need. Together, LCSH, LCGFT, LCMPT, and LCDGT will allow for much more precision and flexibility in searching because terms within and across vocabularies can be mixed and matched to attain the level of specificity required.

It has been elaborated since 1980, autonomously, in relation to the ""Directory of subject headings"" of the Université Laval in Quebec City, itself translated from the list of subject headings of the Library of Congress Subject Headings). The RAMEAU pre-arranged indexing language consists of a vocabulary of interconnected terms and a syntax indicating the rules for constructing index headings. The set of authority records - the core of which consists of common names and geographical names - constitutes the RAMEAU authorities. They are supplemented by a RAMEAU indexing guide which ensures the correct use. The Creatives and Modifications Journal also informs users twice a year about the enhancements and evolutions of the indexing language. Unlike a thesaurus, the RAMEAU language is not built a priori but enriched as the needs of indexing, based on the proposals formulated by the network of its users through a National Proposal File BRANCH."
180	Education Resources Information Center Thesaurus	https://eric.ed.gov/?ti=all	The Thesaurus of ERIC Descriptors (Thesaurus) is a controlled vocabulary – a carefully selected list of education-related words and phrases assigned to ERIC records to organize them by subject and make them easier to retrieve through a search. Searching by Descriptors involves selecting relevant terms from this controlled vocabulary to locate information on your topic. While you can also search ERIC using keywords of your choosing, you will get more precise search results if you use Thesaurus terms. That's because searching by keywords requires matching the exact words found in a record, while searching by Descriptors allows you to locate records indexed by subject, regardless of the terminology the author may have used. The ERIC Thesaurus will allow you to conduct systemic searches and save time by reducing guesswork and trial-and-error methods.

1809	WordNet	https://wordnet.princeton.edu/	WordNet® is a large lexical database of English. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept. Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations. The resulting network of meaningfully related words and concepts can be navigated with the browser. WordNet is also freely and publicly available for download. WordNet's structure makes it a useful tool for computational linguistics and natural language processing.  WordNet superficially resembles a thesaurus, in that it groups words together based on their meanings. However, there are some important distinctions. First, WordNet interlinks not just word forms—strings of letters—but specific senses of words. As a result, words that are found in close proximity to one another in the network are semantically disambiguated. Second, WordNet labels the semantic relations among words, whereas the groupings of words in a thesaurus does not follow any explicit pattern other than meaning similarity.

1813	Incluseum Metadata Schema	https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bzh2lQ7JEDUGbklKQlJ0TGY5bk0/view?usp=sharing	Over the last three years of our work with the Incluseum, we’ve thought, written, and talked extensively of the power of words. (...) Working through the medium of the blog, however, we became dissatisfied with our ad-hoc and fractured way of organizing content. In other words, related content has not been systematically categorized and labelled as to make their relations visible. Moreover, we were concerned that our simple buckets (e.g., 'race/racism', 'gender', etc.) did not accurately capture how we wanted to be referring to the content in our blogposts. To address this situation, we partnered with Gabbie Barnes and Becca Fronczak, both students in the University of Washington’s Master in Library and Information Science program. They used their skills to develop a metadata schema for The Incluseum blog. A metadata schema helps create a standard for how things (i.e., information resources) should be described within a particular context to enhance user access. Here, their goal was also to ensure that the metadata schema would match The Incluseum’s values.

The Data Type Ship Types are intended to be used with the Data Set Named Ship Types and the Data Set Series Manufactured Ships. The maritime heritage is a concern for many. We are therefore eight maritime museums that collaborate on common authorities and vocabulary in order to be able to describe the maritime heritage in a unified way. (...) The goal is for our cooperation to provide improved quality, searchability and usability in the information about the maritime heritage. Please use authorities and vocabulary and contact Malin Joakimson (mailto:Malin.Joakimson@maritima.se) if you and your institution want to take a more active part of the cooperation. The starting point for the list of ship types has been The Getty Research Institute's Art and Architecture Thesaurus and the terms linked To Vessel / Watercraf This material has since been translated, reproduced and supplemented to meet the needs of the maritime heritage in the Nordic waters. The terms have been linked to Gettys thesaurus and against Wikidata with the aim of facilitating links and searchability.

Each lemma is accompanied by the acronym of the Dress-Dresser board field, for which the valuation can be used; The value """" descr """" indicates that the lemma is not included in a control vocabulary and can be used as a valid technical term in descriptive free text fields in the given form.  The limbs that define the types of garments, if they are related to morphological typologies, are described within the main lymph while they generally have autonomous definitions when they also have a historical thickness.  The terms relating to the historical or commercial name of the garment / garment element to be used for the OGTS field enhancement are defined within the reference limb and are to be understood as significant examples of terms that, if documented with reference to the good Object of cataloging, they must value the same OGTS field.  Within the description of the main term are also given useful indications for the correct compilation of the clothing-dresser board.  The acronyms of the Dress-Decoration Clothing Reference Card are:  OGTD: definition  OGTT: tailoring type  OGTS: historical / commercial name """""

These stories often share similar themes, characters, items, and locations: by providing an approach to linking these items together, stories can become powerfully navigable, discoverable, and open to new analysis and creation techniques. The Stories ontology was developed in collaboration with the BBC, with an aim to creating an ontology for narrative representation that could be applied across a diverse set of cases. These included accounts of events in Northern Ireland, the storylines of Doctor Who episodes, and key events of the Battle of Britain. The Stories Ontology is built upon the oft-used Event and Timeline ontologies, thus ensuring interoperability with many existing datasets and allowing for the use of extension ontologies when needed.

18339	The Vagueness Ontology	http://www.essepuntato.it/2013/10/vagueness	Vagueness is a common human knowledge and language phenomenon, typically manifested by terms and concepts like High, Expert, Bad, Near, etc. It is a phenomenon related to our inability to precisely determine the extensions of such concepts in certain domains and contexts. That is because vague concepts have typically blurred boundaries which do not allow for a sharp distinction between the entities that fall within their extension and those that do no. For example, some people are borderline tall: not clearly 'tall' and not clearly 'not tall'. In an OWL ontology vagueness may primarily appear in the definitions of classes, object and datatype properties, and datatypes. A class is vague if, in the given domain, context or application scenario, it admits borderline cases, namely if there are (or could be) individuals for which it is indeterminate whether they instantiate the class. Typical vague classes are attributions, namely classes that reflect qualitative states of entities (e.g., TallPerson, ExperiencedResearcher etc.). Similarly, an object property (relation) is vague if there are (or could be) pairs of individuals for which it is indeterminate whether they stand in the relation (e.g., hasGenre, hasIdeology etc.). The same applies for datatype properties and pairs of individuals and literal values. Finally, a vague datatype consists of a set of vague terms. An example is the datatype RestaurantPriceRange when this comprises the terms 'cheap', 'moderate' and 'expensive'. The Vagueness Ontology enables the explicit identification and description of vague entities and (some of) their vagueness-related characteristics in OWL ontologies. Such a description is to be made by ontology creators and its goal is the narrowing of the possible interpretations that its vague entities may assume by human and software agents.

18348	Vocabulary of a Friend	http://lov.okfn.org/vocommons/voaf/	VOAF is a vocabulary specification providing elements allowing the description of vocabularies (RDFS vocabularies or OWL ontologies) used in the Linked Data Cloud. In particular it provides properties expressing the different ways such vocabularies can rely on, extend, specify, annotate or otherwise link to each other. It relies itself on Dublin Core and voiD. The name of the vocabulary makes an explicit reference to FOAF because VOAF can be used to define networks of vocabularies in a way similar to the one FOAF is used to define networks of people.
18349	Vocabulary Of Attribution and Governance	http://linkedmodel.org/doc/voag/1.0/	VOAG stands for 'Vocabulary Of Attribution and Governance'. The ontology is intended to specify licensing, attribution, provenance and governance of an ontology. VOAG captures many common license types and their restrictions. Where a license requires attribution, VOAG provides resources that allow the attribution should be made. Provenance is defined in terms of source and pedigree. A miminal model of governance is provided based on how issues, releases and changes are managed. VOAG does not import, but makes uses of some concepts from VOID (http://vocab.deri.ie/void), notably void:Dataset.

18361	The Workflow Motif Ontology	http://purl.org/net/wf-motifs	Scientific workflows have been increasingly used in the last decade as an instrument for data intensive science. Workflows serve a dual function: first, as detailed documentation of the scientific method used for an experiment (i. e. the input sources and processing steps taken for the derivation of a certain data item), and second, as re-usable, executable artifacts for data-intensive analysis. Scientific workflows are composed of a variety of data manipulation activities such as Data Movement, data transformation, Data Analysis and Data Visualization to serve the goals of the scientific study. The composition is done through the constructs made available by the workflow system used, and is largely shaped by the function undertaken by the workflow and the environment in which the system operates. (...) This document specifies the classes and properties of the Workflow Motifs ontology, the OWL 2 encoding ot the aforementioned motif catalogue. The goal of this ontology is to provide the means to annotate workflows and their steps with the motifs of the vocabulary, without setting any restriction on how the workflows are defined themselves.

Without some kind of signature or other similar verification mechanism, there is no way to understand who made these statements. One way to document who made a set of statements is via the use of Digital Signatures: signing a document using Public Key Cryptography. The WOT, or Web Of Trust, schema is designed to facilitate the use of Public Key Cryptography tools such as PGP or GPG to sign RDF documents and document these signatures.
18371	xAPI Controlled Vocabulary Ontology	http://purl.org/xapi/ontology	XAPI vocabularies are created and shared by Communities of Practice (CoPs) to help facilitate the reuse of Verbs and Activity Types. This schema was designed to enhance the semantic interoperability of xAPI by encouraging the adoption of RDF principles and publishing practices. This document defines a schema and provides descriptions of each of the classes and properties that are recommended for use when classifying and publishing datasets as RDF. By using RDF to describe xAPI vocabulary datasets, CoPs can increase discoverability and enable applications to easily consume metadata from multiple sources. Representing xAPI vocabulary datasets as RDF also further enables decentralized publishing of Verbs and Activity Types and can facilitate an open federated dataset search capability across applications, platforms, and CoPs.

LOD is used to create Web artifacts that machines can interpret, so publishing machine-readable statistical classifications and other concept management systems as SKOS instances is desired. The XKOS developers found that SKOS was insufficient for the problem. No aspect of SKOS was found to be wrong, just incomplete. Therefore, an extension to SKOS, called XKOS, is proposed. XKOS extends SKOS for the needs of statistical classifications. It does so in two main directions. First, it defines a number of terms that enable the representation of statistical classifications with their structure and textual properties, as well as the relations between classifications. Second, it refines SKOS semantic properties to allow the use of more specific relations between concepts. Those specific relations can be used for the representation of classifications or for any other case where SKOS is employed. XKOS adds the extensions that are desirable to meet the requirements of the statistical community.
18375	XML Schema	http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema	XSD (XML Schema Definition), a recommendation of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), specifies how to formally describe the elements in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document.

18387	Law terminology		Since the mid-1960s, an attempt has been made to simplify the legal drafting language in the common law countries. Particular emphasis was placed on the need to use simple language without redundancies and legalese so that legal texts are clear and understandable even by those who do not have legal training but do not lack legal integrity And validity. The above effort has been systematically organized, among other things, through the creation of various organizations in the UK, such as the Plain English Campaign, Clarity and Plain Language Commission, which aimed to promote the change of the traditional legal writing style by introducing the use of simple English Languages. Today, the use of simple English in drafting legal texts has been adopted at the state level not only in the UK and the United States, but also in other countries of Anglo-American law, such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada. However, traditional English legal terminology is still widely used. The main reason for this approach is linked to the belief that the interpretation of these established legal expressions can not be challenged by the courts. Regardless of whether the author of a legal text chooses traditional or plain English, the translation of legal texts into English requires knowledge of the substantive differences between the civil law and the common law in order to achieve accurate performance Of legal terms and concepts, and in any case a specific expressive style should be chosen to ensure uniformity and consistency in the outcome. Finally, the choice of linguistic type between British English and American English is not only aesthetic, but it also implies knowledge of the differences in terminology between these two types of English.

18393	Widener System		Note that Widener uses two separate classification systems to shelve books: the Old Widener System and the Library of Congress System indicated by call numbers that begin with WID-LC. (...) In the Old Widener System, call numbers contain whole numbers and are separated by periods that do not confer a decimal value. (...) In Library of Congress WID-LC Classes, call numbers are separated by periods that do confer a decimal value.
18394	Yale Library Classification		The beginning of the subject-classification system - books arranged by subject according to a classification schedule - is dated, rather too precisely, as 1890, because in that year the second library building (Chittenden Hall) was opened. The first library building, originally containing about 20,000 volumes, had reached its capacity of some 200,000 volumes in less than fifty years. The necessity of expanding into a second building made the year 1890 a natural time for making a radical change, which had undoubtedly been contemplated for several years. Although it may be obvious that all 200,000 books were not reclassified at once, it is difficult to realize that twenty-five years elapsed before the bulk of the books had been dealt with, and even today there are a few of the numbered-shelves books which still await reclassification. It is this very length of time occupied in the transition that accounts for much of the indigenous heterogeneity of the Yale Library's classification system. One element that caused delay was the choice of classification schedules. Although many more libraries were using subject classification schemes in 1890 than in 1701, especially in America, the Library of Congress schedules had not yet been published. Dewey's Decimal Classification had reached its third edition, but its rigidly topical structure had no great appeal for members of the Yale faculty, who preferred either a geographical or chronological approach to their material. Other available schemes were also rejected, and Addison Van Name, then Librarian, began work on a new system for Yale, based to a large extent on the classification recently devised by Hartwig for the University of Halle.
18395	Yale Law Library Classification	https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015036872680	This classification is designed solely to serve the purposes of the Yale Law School and its Library. It is published primarily for the use of the Yale Law Library staff now and in the future. In its preparation no thought was given to the question whether or not it might be adopted by other libraries. (...) The basis of procedure was that the classification should serve the Library, rather than that the Library should be bound by a preconceived theoretical classification. Although it does in fact in most instances facilitate access to the shelves by readers working as lawyers are accustomed to work, it does not purport to bring all material on a given subject together. This seemed to be neither possible nor desirable, and therefore emphasis has from the outset been laid on the subject side of the card catalogue to which one must, in any library, refer in order to find all material in the library on a given subject.
18396	Institute Library Classification System	http://institutelibrary.org/borden-classification/	The Institute Library’s classification system is unique. It was created by our first professional librarian, William A. Borden, who served as librarian between 1897- and 1903-1910. After the establishment of the New Haven Free Public Library in 1887, the Institute Library began to withdraw from the public life of the city and focus primarily on expanding and circulating its collection of general-interest and popular literature. The librarian during this period, William A. Borden, made use of the Institute Library as a laboratory in which to experiment with new library technologies and practices. During the first six months of his engagement, he developed a new classification system for the library’s collection, which is unique to the Institute Library and remains in use today, together with Borden’s original card catalog. In 1910, Borden accepted an invitation from the progressive Indian prince, Maharaja Savajirao Gaekwad III of Baroda, to create and direct a free public library system for the people of his state.

The taxonomy has been developed by the GenPORT Consortium in consultation with several stakeholders over the entire duration of the project. Currently, the taxonomy is fixed; however, it is available as standard compliant vocuabulary. GenPORT is currently exploring possibilities with other online sites (see for example EIGE's Gender Equality Glossary) to cross-reference content based on shared taxonomy terms.
18442	Online Taxonomic Key Application	http://taxonomy.royalbcmuseum.bc.ca/Taxonomy/	Welcome to Online Taxonomic Keys, a joint project of Fisheries and Oceans Canada and the Royal BC Museum. This project seeks to facilitate the development of, and make readily available, a variety of regional and global identification keys in a format that is concise and easy to use. The information presented is compiled from published and unpublished works from taxonomic specialists worldwide. Taxonomic keys are important tools used by scientists and other investigators to identify specific organisms based on defining characteristics. Up until the last decade, these keys were most often published as dichotomous keys, in which specimens are identified by choosing from a progressive series of pairs of options until a solution is reached. While dichotomous keys are still universally used, the online arena provides the opportunity to design and use keys based on a character matrix. The identification keys on this site are based on a character matrix format. Specimens may be identified by selecting one or more character states (columns) for each character (rows). As selections are made a list of possible species identifications will appear at the bottom of the matrix. Clicking on the species name opens an information sheet with more information to help you understand the specimen you’ve identified. This library of identification keys is a work in progress, and will grow and expand as new keys become available.
18443	Classification of Mechanical Puzzles	http://www.puzzlemuseum.com/class/pzcla01.htm	A puzzle should be classified by the problem that its designer intended the solver to encounter whilst attempting to solve it. In the case of a 3D interlocking assembly in the form of a cage with a ball in the centre: the fact that the instructions request the would-be solver to 'remove the ball' does not change the 3D assembly into an opening puzzle. The disassembly and/or reassembly of the cage remains the primary function of the puzzle. An interlocking puzzle should be classified according to its interior construction, rather than its outward appearance (e.g. a wooden cube, sphere, barrel, or teddy bear may all have similar Cartesian internal construction and so should all be classed as Interlocking-Cartesian). In cases where it seems possible to place a puzzle in more than one category, it must be classified in whichever is the most significant category. A few puzzles may have to be cross-referenced if it is absolutely necessary; however in most puzzles, which include two different classes of problem, one class will usually be dominant by virtue of the fact that in solving it, the secondary problem has also been solved. A good example of multiple-class puzzles is the 'Mazy Ball Game' made in Taiwan in the 1990s - It is based on a 3x3 sliding block puzzle under a clear plastic top - The pieces have L-shaped groves and a ball must be rolled up a ramp in the lower right onto one of the blocks - the ball must be moved from block to block and the blocks themselves slid around so that the ball can exit at the top left. Thus the puzzle requires Dexterity, Sequential movement and Routefinding. It would be classed as Routefinding because, if the route has been found, then the dexterity and sequence must have also been achieved. A puzzle will be referred to as 2D if its third dimension is irrelevant (e.g. thickness of paper or plywood or an operation involving a third dimension such as folding). Most standard jigsaws are 2D; however jigsaws with sloping cuts in fact have a relevant third dimension, so they must be classed as 3D. It will be noted that the definition of 'A Puzzle' excludes the infants 'posting box' which whilst perhaps puzzling the infant was contrived only to educate and amuse; it also excludes the archer attempting to get a bulls‑eye, the exercise of whose ingenuity is entirely incidental to the original warlike intent of the sport. Also excluded are puzzles that only require paper and pencil (e.g. crossword puzzles), unless they are on or part of some physical object. It is understood that specialist collectors will further subdivide the Sub‑Classes to suit their own specialised needs. For example, Tanglement Rigid & Tanglement Semi-Rigid is awaiting a thorough study of the topology of wire puzzles. The full abbreviations consist of 3 characters, hyphen, plus up to 4 characters, such as 'INT‑CART'. These are the standard abbreviations for the classes that have been chosen for relative ease of memory and conformity with most computer databases.

18445	Climate Bonds Taxonomy	https://www.climatebonds.net/standards/taxonomy	The Climate Bonds Taxonomy provides broad guidance for prospective green bond and climate bond issuers and investors. Guided by the Climate Science Advisory Panel, the aim of the Taxonomy is to encourage common definitions across global markets, in a way that supports the growth of a cohesive thematic bond market. (...) The Climate Bonds Taxonomy has been designed to be consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) AR5 report for both the emissions signature of a low-carbon economy required to avoid dangerous climate change and the selection of technologies and practices consistent with that signature. Wherever possible the Taxonomy references existing standards. The Taxonomy is intended for broad guidance only. Detailed eligibility is required for certification, and these are being developed by Climate Bonds Standards expert committees.
18446	IAB Tech Lab Content Taxonomy	https://www.iab.com/guidelines/iab-quality-assurance-guidelines-qag-taxonomy/	Contextual taxonomy was developed in consultation with taxonomy experts from academia, ad measurement companies, and members of the IAB Networks & Exchanges Committee. This taxonomy defines contextual content categories on at least three different tiers. The 'IAB Tech Lab Content Taxonomy' was previously called the 'Quality Assurance Guidelines (QAG) Taxonomy.' The first tier is a broad level category defined as a targeting depth of either: category/portal, site section, or page. Tier 2 categories and greater are additional categories nested under Tier 1 categories. Both tier 1 and tier 2 categories are formerly established for the IQG Program (formerly QAG Program) so that content classification can be consistent across the industry.

18448		http://amecorg.com/amecframework/home/supporting-material/taxonomy/	A wide range of models of PR and communication evaluation exist using a wide range of terms including inputs, outputs, outtakes, outflows, outgrowths, effects, results, and impact. An even wider range of metrics and methods for evaluation are proposed for each stage. The field is confusing for many practitioners. This page presents a taxonomy of evaluation tailored to strategic public communication – a taxonomy being a mapping of a field to produce a categorisation of concepts and terms – in short, to show where things go and where they fit in relation to each other. This taxonomy identifies: 1) The major stages of communication (such as inputs, outputs, etc.); 2) The key steps involved in each stage (such as distribution of information, reception by audiences, etc.); 3) Examples of metrics and milestones that can be generated or identified as part of evaluation at each stage; and 4) The most commonly used methods for generating these metrics and milestones.

18451	Taxonomy of the Logical Fallacies	http://www.fallacyfiles.org/taxonomy.html	The Fallacy Files Taxonomy is a tree-like structure that classifies all of the fallacies in these files by the sub-fallacy relation. A sub-fallacy, which is a specific version of a more general fallacy, has whatever features the more general fallacy has, together with specific features which set it apart and make it worth naming in its own right. For example, instead of grouping together 'fallacies of relevance', there is one most general such fallacy—namely, Red Herring—and all fallacies of relevance are sub-fallacies of it. Red Herring is itself a sub-fallacy of Informal Fallacy, which is a sub-fallacy of the most general logical fallacy of all: Logical Fallacy. Logical Fallacy is, thus, the top node of the Taxonomy, for every fallacy in the Taxonomy is a sub-fallacy of it. The sub-fallacy relationship is like a tree with a trunk―Logical Fallacy―which branches until it reaches leaves, that is, fallacies which have no sub-fallacies―for example, Appeal to Celebrity.
18452	EPOC Taxonomy	http://epoc.cochrane.org/sites/epoc.cochrane.org/files/public/uploads/epoc_taxonomy_13.12.16.pdf	The first EPOC taxonomy of health systems interventions was developed in 2002, and included the following categories: (1) professional interventions; (2) financial interventions; (3) organisational interventions; and (4) regulatory interventions. This taxonomy was extensively revised and updated between 2013 and 2015 to address key gaps and also to bring the EPOC taxonomy into alignment with other taxonomies that were being used to classify health systems interventions in widely used online databases (Lavis 2015). Our starting point was a taxonomy for health systems arrangements developed for the Health Systems Evidence database (http://www.healthsystemsevidence.org) (Lavis 2015). We applied this taxonomy to all of the interventions included in four overviews of systematic reviews of health systems interventions of high relevance to low income countries (Ciapponi 2014; Herrera 2014; Pantoja 2014; Wiysonge 2014). The taxonomy was then revised iteratively to ensure that all of the included reviews were appropriately categorized and that all relevant health system arrangements and implementation strategies were included and organized logically. We then applied the revised taxonomy to all of the interventions covered by EPOC reviews. Further minor revisions were made to the taxonomy at this stage to ensure appropriate categorisation of interventions and we also refined the definitions of each of the categories and subcategories.
18453	Taxonomy of Innovation	https://hbr.org/2014/01/a-taxonomy-of-innovation	Fast-changing markets demand rapid development of new products and processes. Thousands of tools and methods are available to help innovators discover what users want and how to deliver on their expectations. The challenge is to figure out which ones to use when. Luma Institute has created a framework to help you choose the best tool for each step of the innovation process, based on the people you’re designing for and the complexity of the systems in which you operate. Luma distilled the portfolio down to 36 of the most effective tools for innovation—the majority of them in common use—organized in three categories: looking, understanding, and making. Each category contains three subcategories, and each subcategory contains four innovation tools. This hierarchical model makes it much easier to identify the tools you need and then put them to use.
18454	COPE Case Taxonomy	http://publicationethics.org/cope-case-taxonomy	In 2013, it became apparent that the publication ethics cases being brought to COPE for discussion and advice were becoming more complex. A new and more comprehensive classification scheme was therefore developed to make it easier to code cases, to aid searching, and to provide a finer level of detail for analysis. The resulting COPE Case Taxonomy comprises 18 main classification categories and 100 keywords and is designed to be descriptive not judgemental. All the cases in COPE’s database were recoded and all new cases are being coded according to the new taxonomy (up to two classifications, denoting the main topics discussed, and 10 keywords can be assigned per case). It is important to note that classification and keyword coding denotes that a topic was raised and discussed, not that a particular form of publication misconduct had occurred. The COPE Case Taxonomy is available, with appropriate attribution, for use by other organizations and individuals. Attribution should include the version date and number, and a link to the taxonomy on COPE’s website.

Each domain contains one or more measurement properties. The domain reliability contains three measurement properties: internal consistency, reliability, and measurement error. The domain validity also contains three measurement properties: content validity, construct validity and criterion validity. The domain responsiveness contains only one measurement property, which is also called responsiveness. The term and definition of the domain and measurement property responsiveness are the same, but they are distinguished in the taxonomy for reasons of clarity. Some measurement properties contain one or more aspects, that were defined separately: Content validity includes face validity, and construct validity includes structural validity, hypotheses testing and cross-cultural validity.
18463	Optimization Taxonomy	https://neos-guide.org/content/optimization-taxonomy	It is difficult to provide a taxonomy of optimization because many of the subfields have multiple links.

It is not intended to assess blame. The document is not all-inclusive, but can be expanded as new issues arise. The purpose of this taxonomy is to provide a standard language and structure of medication error-related data for use in developing databases analyzing medication error reports. (...) The effectiveness of the taxonomy, and the resulting analysis of medication error reports, is dependent upon the amount and the quality of the data collected through medication error reports. For optimum application of the taxonomy, include as much information as possible in the instrument. However, if all the information described in the taxonomy is not collected, the information that is available should be categorized as shown in the taxonomy.

Our hope is that this taxonomy will serve as a resource for organizations attempting to prioritize their defenses and choose controls most appropriate for defending their information systems. We believe that the nature of a common internet and homogeneous systems leads to common threats to information systems. This taxonomy has been created to identify those threats in order to help organizations choose defenses most appropriate to defend such systems.

18471	Systematic Classification Brunet-Parguez-Coulouma		"In 1971, the Toulouse municipal library tested a systematic classification framework developed in 1969 by Henri-Jean MARTIN and Guy PARGUEZ for a study on the automation of cataloging by adding alphanumeric indices to the table frame (1865), the content of the former ""classification of booksellers,"" in which the subjects were divided into five classes: theology, law, science and the arts, belles-lettres, For a decade, the table was used and gradually modified in the presentation and in the content, in conjunction with the cataloging work of the old collection of the WB of Toulouse, then researchers and librarians Have used, which led us to draft a revised version in 1985, in collaboration with the Sibil network and after consulting the users The last update on the ""Brunet-Pargue Z ""took place in February 1994 in Toulouse during the colloquium organized by LIBER (League of European Research Libraries) (...). What is the value of this table? Provide an additional means of identifying books whose contents are poorly defined in an analytical catalog and using unconventional concepts. The advantage of the version developed in Toulouse, where all the rubrics ""mixtures"", in which Brunet inserted his dummy collections, was suppressed, is to encourage the reclassification and exploitation of thousands of brochures during the Despoil of these collections or bundles. The indexing of their contents allows the researcher to find small works, anonymous or of little known authors, who have escaped specialized bibliographies, and which can present a real interest for the human sciences."
18472	BSI Classification Plan	http://www.cite-sciences.fr/fr/au-programme/lieux-ressources/bibliotheque/toutes-les-collections/plan-de-classement/	The BSI classification scheme is specific, and from the outset it has been chosen not to use pre-existing classifications such as CDU or Dewey, so BSI has developed its own tool. The BSI classification scheme is a management tool that allows the distribution of documents: it is intended to classify documents all media and not knowledge. It does not attempt to describe precisely a specific knowledge. Its all media logic implies that a rating may contain only one or more media. The basic structure is a systematic and hierarchical classification, from the general to the particular. The notation of the indices is alphanumeric: one or more letters associated with the section, followed by a numerical index declined according to the decimal principle. Designed to be able to adapt to the documentary policy, the editorial offer, the typology of documents and the evolution of knowledge, the classification plan is regularly reviewed.

Etienne Drioton (1889-1961) was Director General of the Department of Antiquities in Egypt (1936-1952) and Professor at the College de France (1957-1961). The works of his collection are kept in Joffre space and were cataloged in map styles in 1965-1970 years. A file created by authors and anonymous titles, systematic file (after a specific review, see below) and a concordance file is available to the coin store cabinet. In 2005 these catalogs were reverted and records of these books are available on the computer catalog of the NBU and on the Internet.

18499	GOV.UK Taxonomy	https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/21/presenting-our-new-taxonomy-beta/	As members of the Finding Things team have written previously, we’ve long understood the need for a GOV.UK taxonomy that’s subject-based and site-wide, and we’ve been working towards achieving this challenging aim for a while. When finished, the taxonomy will group together all content on the site in a meaningful and intuitive way, using a hierarchical structure. It will consist of many ‘topics’ and ‘subtopics’, to which all content items will be tagged. We’re not there yet, but we do now have a branch that covers the government’s education offering - and with all the relevant content tagged to it, thanks to the tireless work of publishers within the government’s education organisations. (...) So why does government need a site-wide taxonomy? Because government has a lot of content: more than 300,000 individual items, in fact. With so much content it can be very difficult for users to find the thing they’re looking for - or, if they’re searching more broadly around a subject, to find things of real value or relevance. We also know from user research with professional users like teachers, accountants, lawyers and tax specialists that there are people who need to see everything about a topic so they can do their job properly. Without a subject-based taxonomy in place, these users might only get partial information and not the full picture. This new taxonomy will act as a framework for a redesigned navigation, with the 2 working in tandem to help users orientate themselves and explore the site more confidently and effectively.

18501	Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology	https://medicine.stonybrookmedicine.edu/HITOP/AboutHiTOP	Objectives of the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) are to advance the classification of psychopathology to maximize its usefulness for research and clinical practice. The HiTOP aims to address limitations of traditional nosologies, such as the DSM-5 and ICD-10, including arbitrary boundaries between psychopathology and normality, often unclear boundaries between disorders, frequent disorder co-occurrence, heterogeneity within disorders, and diagnostic instability. The HiTOP approaches these problems by conducting an empirical search for psychopathology structures starting from the most basic building blocks and proceeding to the highest level of generality: combining individual signs and symptoms into homogeneous components or traits, assembling them into empirically-derived syndromes, and finally grouping them into psychopathology spectra (e.g., internalizing and externalizing). This approach reduces within-disorder heterogeneity by grouping related symptoms together and assigning unrelated symptoms to different components. It makes comorbidity an explicit and predictable feature of the model by classifying related syndromes together. Finally, it describes psychiatric phenomenaally, addressing boundary problems and diagnostic instability. The HiTOP is not limited to dimensions, if evidence indicates existence of a natural boundary, this qualitative distinction will be incorporated in the model also. The HiTOP system aims to significantly advance mental health research and care, providing an effective way to convey information on risk factors, etiology, pathophysiology, phenomenology, illness course, and treatment response, thus greatly improving the utility of the diagnosis of mental disorders. Dimensional measures have been developed to assess many aspects of the system, and several domains of the HiTOP are ready for clinical and research applications.

Additionally, the FASB publishes an annual release of the Taxonomy to address new reporting requirements.
18503	Internet of Things Taxonomy	https://iotuk.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IOT-Taxonomy-Report.pdf	There is no common way to describe or classify the ‘things’ that make up the IoT or the projects or systems and services based on them. To complicate matters, the range of projects and applications that the term IoT covers is vast. IoT applications could be made up of a simple sensor that reports whether a door is open or not (in the case of a simple security system) or whether a button has been pressed (in the case of a remote doorbell) to very sophisticated solutions that monitor dozens of phenomena, make complex calculations based on those phenomena, and then prompt a response (in the case of autonomous drones, for example). A means of classifying different IoT projects will be useful to properly understand the current state of IoT adoption, compare different IoT initiatives, and to inform decision making when it comes to policy development, and the definition research and market development initiatives.To this end, Digital Catapult has started to define a taxonomy that will provide an effective way of classifying IoT initiatives.

18522		http://www.eagle-network.eu/voc/objtyp.html	The classification of objects on which an inscription can be written is extremely complex in many cases. For example, within the scope of the inscription which would fall under Statue Base, there are few cases in which what survives is an ‘Inscribed plaque’ – an inscription once affixed to a base (made of a different material) – and in other cases our ‘statue base’ in a wider context would more naturally be defined in another way: in particular ‘Triumphal arch’ (say, for the Arch of Constantine, that once supported statues), ‘City gate’ (like those of Rome, with statues of the emperors), or ‘Columnar monument’ (e.g. Trajan’s Column – which of course supported a statue).
18523		http://www.eagle-network.eu/voc/decor.html	Terms in this vocabulary refer to any decoration surrounding an inscription. Hederae, crosses, and chi-rho monograms are probably among the most frequent decorations, but there are a number of classifiable features of decoration which support and are indeed vital in some cases, to the understanding of the inscribed text. Many artistic classification could be suggested, but for the purposes of epi- graphic research we offer a flat list of features which can be found surrounding an inscription.
18524		http://www.eagle-network.eu/voc/dates.html	The common use among Members of the BPN is to insert, when this information is available two dates. A 'Not before' and 'Not after' dates. This is still a best practice and has been preserved as such in any encoding. There are nevertheless divergences on historical periods and indeed in the way computations are done. In many cases only a generic date is possible. In this vocabulary we suggest a series of standardizations which equate some locution with a specific date interval, e.g. 'shortly after' with an interval of ca. 10 years. The Working Group has chosen to always explicitly suggest the corresponding TEI origDate element as a definition in this vocabulary.
18525		http://www.eagle-network.eu/voc/statepreserv.html	State of preservation (which could probably be abbreviated to 'Condition') is a small vocabulary describing the general condition in which the inscription was at the moment of the latest inspection. In many cases we won’t know if an inscription still exists.
18526		http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/metrocenter/resources/glossaries	Literary terms and devices are a collection of universal artistic structures that are typical of all works of literature frequently employed by the writers to give meanings and a logical framework to their works through language. When such works are read by readers, they ultimately recognize and appreciate these literary structures. Due to their universality, they also allow the readers to compare a work of one writer to that of another and often across languages. They not only beautify the piece of literature but also give deeper meanings to it, testing the very understanding of the readers along with providing them enjoyment as they read. Additionally, literary terms and devices help ignite the readers’ imagination as they visualize the characters and scenes of the text.

18532	Teacher career stage	http://vocabulary.curriculum.edu.au/teachercareerstage.html	The Australian Professional Standards for Teachers career stages guide the preparation, support and development of teachers. The stages reflect a continuum of a teacher’s developing professional expertise from undergraduate preparation through to being an exemplary practitioner and a leader in the profession.
18533	Skill Level	http://vocabulary.curriculum.edu.au/skillLevel.html	Skill level is defined as a function of the range and complexity of the set of tasks performed in a particular occupation. The greater the range and complexity of the set of tasks, the greater the skill level of an occupation.
18534	Language Modes	http://vocabulary.curriculum.edu.au/languageModes.html	Modes refer to the various forms of communication – listening, speaking, reading, viewing and writing.
18535	Australian Curriculum Element	http://vocabulary.curriculum.edu.au/curriculumElement.html	Elements used to organise the Australian Curriculum.
18537	Library of Congress Children's Subject Headings	http://id.loc.gov/authorities/childrensSubjects.html	The Library of Congress Subject Headings Supplemental Vocabularies: Children’s Headings (LCSHAC) is a thesaurus which is used in conjunction with LCSH. It is not a self-contained vocabulary, but is instead designed to complement LCSH and provide tailored subject access to children and young adults when LCSH does not provide suitable terminology, form, or scope for children. LCSHAC records can be identified by the LCCN prefix 'sj'.
18538	Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms	http://id.loc.gov/authorities/genreForms.html	The Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms for Library and Archival Materials (LCGFT) is a thesaurus that describes what a work is versus what it is about. For instance, the subject heading Horror films, with appropriate subdivisions, would be assigned to a book about horror films. A cataloger assigning headings to the movie The Texas Chainsaw Massacre would also use Horror films, but it would be a genre/form term since the movie is a horror film, not a movie about horror films. The thesaurus combines both genres and forms. Form is defined as a characteristic of works with a particular format and/or purpose. A 'short' is a particular form, for example, as is 'animation.' Genre refers to categories of works that are characterized by similar plots, themes, settings, situations, and characters. Examples of genres are westerns and thrillers. In the term Horror films 'horror' is the genre and 'films' is the form.
18539	PBCoreAssetType Vocabulary	http://pbcore.org/pbcore-controlled-vocabularies/pbcoreassettype-vocabulary/	pbcoreAssetType is a broad definition of the type of intellectual content being described. Asset types might include those without associated instantiations (a collection or series), or those with instantiations (programs, episodes, clips, etc.) Best practice: The asset type should broadly describe all related instantiations — for example, if an asset includes many instantiations representing different generations of a program, the asset type ‘program’ remains accurate for all of them.
1854	Shelf Classification of the textbook collection of the University Library Leoben.	http://bibliothek.unileoben.ac.at/de/411/	Shelf Classification of the textbook collection of the University Library Leoben.
18540	@dateType Vocabulary	http://pbcore.org/pbcore-controlled-vocabularies/datetype-vocabulary/	dateType is an attribute that classifies by named type the date-related data of the element e.g., created, broadcast, dateAvailableStart. Best practice: Used to clarify how the date is related to the asset or instantiation. Date Created may be the most common, but the element could also be used to describe the Date Accessioned or Date Deaccessioned, for example. Can be used as an attribute of the following elements: pbcoreAssetDate, instantiationDate.
18541	@descriptionType Vocabulary	http://pbcore.org/pbcore-controlled-vocabularies/descriptiontype-vocabulary/	@descriptionType is an attribute used to indicate the type of description being assigned to the element, such as ‘abstract,’ ‘summary,’ or ‘physical description.’ Can be used as an attribute of the pbcoreDescription element.
18542	@titleType Vocabulary	http://pbcore.org/pbcore-controlled-vocabularies/titletype-vocabulary/	@titleType is an attribute used to indicate the type of title being assigned to the asset, such as series title, episode title or project title. Can be used as an attribute of the pbcoreTitle element.
18543	pbcoreRelationType Vocabulary	http://pbcore.org/pbcore-controlled-vocabularies/pbcorerelationtype-vocabulary/	pbcoreRelationType describes the relationship between the asset being describe by the pbcore document and any other asset. Ideally it would contain text from a controlled vocabulary for describing relationships. There is some depth to what a relationship could be. The assets can be related as different episodes in a series, different tapes in a box set, or different versions of an original, among others. Best practice: the assets may be related in that they are different discrete parts of a single intellectual unit, one may be a derivative of another, or they may be different versions that are distinct enough to be described as separate assets.
18544	instantiationRelationType Vocabulary	http://pbcore.org/pbcore-controlled-vocabularies/instatiationrelationtype-vocabulary/	instantiationRelationType describes the relation between the instantiation being described and another instantiation. Best practice: The instantiations may be related in that they are different discrete parts of a single intellectual unit, they may be generationally related, one may be a derivative of another, they may be different versions.
18545	creatorRole and contributorRole Vocabulary	http://pbcore.org/pbcore-controlled-vocabularies/creatorrole-and-contributorrole-vocabulary/	creatorRole is used to identify the role played by the person, people or organization(s) identified in the companion descriptor creator. The PBCore schema allows for creatorRole to be repeated in the pbcoreCreator container element. This can be useful when a single person or organization is associated with multiple roles in an asset. contributorRole is used to identify the role played by the person, people or organizations identified in the companion element contributor. The PBCore schema allows for contributorRole to be repeated in the pbcoreContributor container element. This can be useful when a single person or organization is associated with multiple roles in an asset.
18546	publisherRole Vocabulary	http://pbcore.org/pbcore-controlled-vocabularies/publisherrole-vocabulary/	publisherRole is used to identify the role played by the specific publisher or publishing entity identified in the companion descriptor publisher. The PBCore schema allows for publisherRole to be repeated in the pbcorePublisher container element. This can be useful when a single person or organization is associated with multiple roles in an asset.
18547	instantiationPhysical: Audio Vocabulary	http://pbcore.org/pbcore-controlled-vocabularies/instantiationphysical-audio-vocabulary/	instantiationPhysical is used to identify the format of a particular instantiation as it exists in a physical form that occupies physical space (e.g. a tape on a shelf). This includes physical digital media, such as a DV tape, audio CD, or authored DVD, as well as analog media. Best practice: PBCore provides a controlled vocabulary for media objects, though any controlled vocabulary can be used so long as it is referenced. For digital storage carriers that contain file-based media, such as data CDs, LTO tapes or hard drives, use instantiationDigital to convey the mime type of the file instead of describing the carrier.
18548	instantiationPhysical: Film Vocabulary	http://pbcore.org/pbcore-controlled-vocabularies/instantiationphysical-film-vocabulary/	instantiationPhysical is used to identify the format of a particular instantiation as it exists in a physical form that occupies physical space (e.g. a tape on a shelf). This includes physical digital media, such as a DV tape, audio CD, or authored DVD, as well as analog media. Best practice: PBCore provides a controlled vocabulary for media objects, though any controlled vocabulary can be used so long as it is referenced. For digital storage carriers that contain file-based media, such as data CDs, LTO tapes or hard drives, use instantiationDigital to convey the mime type of the file instead of describing the carrier. The Film vocabulary provides terms for moving image celluloid formats only.
18549	instantiationPhysical: Video Vocabulary	http://pbcore.org/pbcore-controlled-vocabularies/instantiationphysical-video-vocabulary/	instantiationPhysical is used to identify the format of a particular instantiation as it exists in a physical form that occupies physical space (e.g. a tape on a shelf). This includes physical digital media, such as a DV tape, audio CD, or authored DVD, as well as analog media. Best practice: PBCore provides a controlled vocabulary for media objects, though any controlled vocabulary can be used so long as it is referenced. For digital storage carriers that contain file-based media, such as data CDs, LTO tapes or hard drives, use instantiationDigital to convey the mime type of the file instead of describing the carrier. The Video vocabulary provides terms for physical media formats for analog and digital video.

18568	Bioethics Research Library Numerical Classification List	https://bioethics.georgetown.edu/library-materials/bioethics-research-library-databases/classification-scheme/	One of the easiest and most useful ways to search the historical databases created by the Bioethics Research Library at Georgetown University is to browse its classification scheme. Developed by the National Reference Center for Bioethics Literature to encompass the wide diversity found in the cross-disciplinary area of bioethics, it is used as a subject index to the extensive collection of periodical literature. Numbered from 1 to 22, beginning with general ethics, bioethics and philosophy of science, it becomes more specific as the numbers rise. Subdivisions within each main category point out specific topics within particular areas. The largest categories are 9 – Health Care, 18 – Human Experimentation, and 20 – Death and Dying.
18569	Dickinson Classification	http://library.buffalo.edu/music/research/find-music/dickinson.html	The Dickinson classification is a library classification scheme used to catalogue and classify musical compositions. It was developed by George Sherman Dickinson (1886 - 1964), and is used by many music libraries, primarily those at University at Buffalo, Vassar, and Columbia Universities. It is fully detailed by Carol June Bradley in The Dickinson classification : a cataloguing & classification manual for music; including a reprint of the George Sherman Dickinson Classification of Musical Compositions published by Carlisle Books (1968).

The main classes are the same as in the Dewey Decimal Classification but these are in a different order: Natural sciences 400; Technology and engineering 500; Arts 600; Language 700.
18571	Garside Classification	http://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/subject-support/garside/#top	The Garside Classification Scheme is one of those used in the libraries of UCL. It was devised by Kenneth Garside while he was deputy librarian there. Intellectually, it was based on the close relationship between the library and the teaching departments. The library at UCL rejected the major published classification schemes because 'none of them would generally acceptable to the teaching departments without such major modifications as would have destroyed its essential character.' Instead, it was modeled around the 'subject reading rooms' into which the collection had been divided. The intent was to utilise the expertise of the departments, and their teaching needs in drawing up the divisions within the scheme.
18572	London Education Classification	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Education_Classification	The London Education Classification is a library classification and indexing thesaurus used at the UCL Institute of Education. It was devised by D.J. Foskett and Joy Foskett. It was devised to address deficiencies in general classification schemes in dealing with education. It was originally devised in 1963, and revised in 1974. It is a faceted classification, inspired by the work of S.R. Ranganathan and of the Classification Research Group.
18573	Australian and New Zealand Standard Research Classification: Fields of Research	http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1297.0	The Australian and New Zealand Standard Research Classification (ANZSRC) is jointly produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and Statistics New Zealand (Statistics NZ). ANZSRC is the collective name for a set of three related classifications developed for use in the measurement and analysis of research and experimental development (R&D) undertaken in Australia and New Zealand. The three constituent classifications included in the ANZSRC are: Type of Activity (TOA), Fields of Research (FOR), and Socio-economic Objective (SEO). ANZSRC replaces the Australian Standard Research Classification (ASRC 1998) and introduces a new framework for measuring research and development activity in New Zealand. The use of the three constituent classifications in the ANZSRC ensures that R&D statistics collected are useful to governments, educational institutions, international organisations, scientific, professional or business organisations, business enterprises, community groups and private individuals in Australia and New Zealand.
18574	Australian and New Zealand Standard Research Classification: Socio-Economic Objective	http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1297.0	The Australian and New Zealand Standard Research Classification (ANZSRC) is jointly produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and Statistics New Zealand (Statistics NZ).

(accessed at http://www.niso.org/standards/resources/Z39-19-2005.pdf, 6/19/06) for semantic relationships between vocabulary terms, supplemented by Allen and Ferguson (1994) temporal relationships (1 dimensional topology) that are needed to express ordering relationships between time ordinal eras in a time scale or events in an event vocabulary. Narrower term relationship is deprecated in favor of usage of broader term links for hierarchical relationships. This makes searching easier because hierarchy links are always from a narrow (child) term to a broader (parent) terms. By extension, this vocabulary includes all concepts in this conceptScheme, as well as concepts in any previous versions of the scheme.
18583	Value Qualifier	https://vocabs.ands.org.au/value-qualifier	This file contains the CGI Value Qualifier vocabulary, as defined by the IUGS Commission for Geoscience Information (CGI) Geoscience Terminology Working Group. These terms are taken from the enumeration for values that may be assigned as the valueQualifier on CGI_Value. Definitions are proposed. This codelist includes qualifiers of several sorts: 1. frequence of occurrence--qualifiers that indicate how many occurrences of a described feature are expected to have a reported value. E.g. 'commonly red, sometimes brown'; 2. kinds of statistical procedure used to determine a single value to report based on a collection of observed values, e.g. mean, median, mode.; 3. kinds of nil values; 4. kind of value--a limiting value or the actual estimated value.

18591	NPG Summary Types Ontology	http://www.nature.com/ontologies/models/domain/summary-types/	The SummaryTypes Ontology is a categorization of summaries – including Short Summary, Long Summary and Standfirst – that are associated with specific articles. These summaries are written by editors, in contrast to abstracts which are written by the article authors.
18592	NPG Review States Ontology	https://github.com/springernature/public-npg-domain-ontology/blob/master/npg-review-states-ontology.ttl	The ReviewStates Ontology is a categorization of the various states that mark the review status of a publication. In particular, these indicate stages in the publishing workflow. For example, a siginificant state change for an article publication occurs when it is accepted for publication, whereby it transitions from an earlier 'Received' state to an 'Accepted' state. These state changes are managed by review-event objects which capture both the review-state and the date (or datetime) at which this event occurs.
18593	ArticleTypes Ontology	https://github.com/springernature/public-npg-domain-ontology/blob/master/npg-article-types-ontology.ttl	The ArticleTypes Ontology is a categorization of kinds of publication which are used to index and group content published on nature.com. This taxonomy is organised into a single tree using the SKOS vocabulary. It includes article-types that are directly applied to content, such as Article, Review Article, News, or Book Review plus higher-level groupings such as Research, News and Comment, or Amendments and Corrections. Categorization of content with the ArticleTypes Ontology is orthogonal to categorization with the Subjects Ontology.
18594	NPG Blogs Ontology	https://github.com/springernature/public-npg-domain-ontology/blob/master/npg-blogs-ontology.ttl	The Blogs Ontology is the master catalogue of blogs from Macmillan Science and Education.

18596	NPG Publish States Ontology	https://github.com/springernature/public-npg-domain-ontology/blob/master/npg-publish-states-ontology.ttl	The PublishStates Ontology is a categorization of the various states that mark the publishing status of a publication. In particular, these indicate stages in the publishing workflow. For example, a siginificant state change for an online article publication occurs when it is bound to an issue publication, whereby it transitions from an earlier 'Advance online publication' state to an 'Issue publication' state. These state changes are managed by publish-event objects which capture both the publish-state and the date (or datetime) at which this event occurs.
18597	NPG Relations Ontology	https://github.com/springernature/public-npg-domain-ontology/blob/master/npg-relations-ontology.ttl	The Relations Ontology is a catalogue of the kinds of relation which are used to manage our linked publications. This catalogue of relationships is organised as a SKOS concept scheme scheme although no concepts are supplied. There will often exist a significant relationship between a pair of articles which are published separately. For example, a published article may subsequently be corrected via an erratum published as an article in its own right. This erratum can declare a relationship with the article it is amending by using a relations:isErratumOf relationship between itself and the article. It is then possible to add the inverse property relations:hasErratum on the original article to point to the erratum which has amended it in some way. The Relations Ontology lists many such pairs of relationships. All of these relationships are subproperties of the Core Ontology property :relation.
18598	NPG Severity Levels Ontology	https://github.com/springernature/public-npg-domain-ontology/blob/master/npg-severity-levels-ontology.ttl	The SeverityLevels Ontology is a modelling of the syslog message severity values from RFC 5424. (...) This is used in conjunction with the SPIN vocabulary to label exceptions that we may create in our build process. This process makes extensive use of SPIN rules. Validation tests are applied to a given data model via a SPARQL construct query and any exceptions raised are added to the :Graph object associated to a class. This :Graph object is used to add RDF annotations about the class instance named graph.
18599	WordNet-Affect Taxonomy	https://www.gsi.dit.upm.es/ontologies/wnaffect/	WordNet-Affect is an extension of WordNet Domains. It includes a subset of synsets suitable to represent affective concepts correlated with affective word.

18602	Registry Interchange Format - Collections and Services (Vocabularies)	https://vocabs.ands.org.au/rifcs	The RIF-CS schema is a data interchange format that supports the electronic exchange of collection and service descriptions. It organises information about collections and services into a format used by the Australian National Data Service (ANDS) Collections Registry. More information on the RIF-CS Schema can be found at http://ands.org.au/guides/cpguide/cpgrifcs.html. With assistance from the RIF-CS Advisory Board and user community, ANDS has developed a suggested vocabulary for use with the RIF-CS Schema. The vocabulary is comprised of suggested terms for specific elements of the schema. Use of the ANDS vocabulary with the RIF-CS Schema is not mandatory but is however recommended. Use of consistent terminology improves data discoverability and the precision of search operations. The ANDS vocabularies are expected to be informed and developed further by the RIF-CS user community.
18603	Raw Material Role	https://vocabs.ands.org.au/raw-material-role	This file contains the CGI Raw Material Role vocabulary, as defined by the IUGS Commission for Geoscience Information (CGI) Geoscience Terminology Working Group.

18606	Chinese Agricultural Thesaurus	http://cat.aii.caas.cn/	Chinese Agricultural Thesaurus (CAT) is the largest agricultural domain thesaurus in China, which is held and maintained by AII of CAAS. CAT was the important fruits of more than 100 professionals’ six years hard work. The international and national standards were adopted while designing and constructing CAT. CAT covers areas including agriculture, forestry, biology, etc. It is organized in 40 main categories and contains more than 63 thousands concepts and most of them have English translation. In addition, CAT includes more than 130 thousands semantic relationships such as Use, UF, BT, NT and RT. CAT is now available as a Linked Data set published. The Linked Data version of CAT is in RDF/SKOS-XL, and is stored in Virtuoso triple store. Data is accessible to machines through a SPARQL endopoint, and to humans by means of a HTML pages generated with Virtuoso. From 2005, AII cooperated with FAO, started the CAT to AGROVOC mapping work, conforming to the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) mapping rules (skos: exactMatch, broadMatch and narrowMatch were mainly considered and applied). In addition, CAT has also been mapped to EUROVOC, NALT, LCSH automatically just based on the label string exact match. These mapping results could lay fundamental bases for higher level interoperability (e.g. cross-lingual information retrieval and knowledge discovery applications).
18607	Proportion Term	https://vocabs.ands.org.au/proportion-term	This file contains the CGI Proportion Term vocabulary, as defined by the IUGS Commission for Geoscience Information (CGI) Geoscience Terminology Working Group. This vocabulary provides terms that may be used to qualitatively express abundance of composition parts in a geologic unit or earth material description. Quantity that specifies the fraction of the geologic unit composed of the compound material. This vocabulary is used for GeologicUnit.GeologicUnitPart.proportion, GeologicUnit.compositionPart.proportion, and for compoundMaterial.ConsituentPart.proportion.

By extension, this vocabulary includes all concepts in this conceptScheme, as well as concepts in any previous versions of the scheme.
18612	Particle Type	https://vocabs.ands.org.au/viewById/88	This file contains the CGI Particle type vocabulary, as defined by the IUGS Commission for Geoscience Information (CGI) Geoscience Terminology Working Group. Used to specify particleType in particleTypeDescription associated with a compoundMaterial. Terms to specify the nature of individual particles of each constituent in an aggregation, based mostly on their genesis. Because the constituents are identifiable parts, the part units must have some definition. Examples include clasts, crystals, pore space, material fossil. Constituent type is determined based on the nature of the particles, and ideally is independent of the relationship between particles in a compound material aggregation. By extension, this vocabulary includes all concepts in this conceptScheme, as well as concepts in any previous versions of the scheme.
18613	Particle Shape	https://vocabs.ands.org.au/particle-shape	This file contains the CGI Particle Shape vocabulary, as defined by the IUGS Commission for Geoscience Information (CGI) Geoscience Terminology Working Group. The Shape attribute describes, a) the development of crystal faces bounding particles in crystalline compond materials, and b) surface rounding of grains in sedimentary rocks. Roundness is a measure of the sharpness of the edges between surfaces bounding a particle (see Jackson, 1997; Wadell, 1932) and is an indication of the degree of abrasion of a clastic particle. Expressed by Wadell (1932) as the ratio of the average radius of curvature of the several edges or corners of the particle to the radius of curvature of the maximum inscribed sphere (or to one-half the nominal diameter of the particle). The value is more conveniently computed from a plane figure (a projection or cross section); thus, roundness may be defined as the ratio of the average radius of curvature of the corners of the particle image to the radius of the maximum inscribed circle. A perfectly rounded particle (such as a sphere) has a roundness value of 1.0; less-rounded particles have values less than 1.0. The corresponding concept in aggregates with crystalline as opposed to clastic grains is here referred to as crystallinity, and is the degree to which a mineral grain is bounded by crystal faces. Terms should be appropriate for the kind of compound material (eg: for crystalline rocks- euhedral, ideoblastic, subhedral, anhedral, xenoblastic; for sedimentary rocks - angular, rounded). By extension, this vocabulary includes all concepts in this conceptScheme, as well as concepts in any previous versions of the scheme.
18614	Particle Aspect Ratio	https://vocabs.ands.org.au/particle-aspect-ratio	This file contains the CGI Particle Aspect Ratio vocabulary, as defined by the IUGS Commission for Geoscience Information (CGI) Geoscience Terminology Working Group. AspectRatio describes the geometry of particles based on the ratios of lengths of long, intermediate and short axes of grains. Equates to sphericity in sedimentary rocks (ie: the degree to which the shape of a particle approximates a sphere). A quantitative specification is based on the ratio of lengths of long, intermediate and short axes of grain shape (Sneed and Folk, 1958; Zingg, 1935). This vocabulary includes terms for specifying average shape of some collection of particles.(eg: prolate, slightly flattened, very bladed, equant, acicular, tabular). Numeric shape values from Sneed and Folk (1958) are best understood by looking at the pictures of particles with the different shapes there and in Pettijohn et al. (1972). By extension, this vocabulary includes all concepts in this conceptScheme, as well as concepts in any previous versions of the scheme.
18615	Orientation Determination Method	https://vocabs.ands.org.au/orientation-determination-method	This scheme specifies concepts used to describe the method used to determine the planar or linear orientation of a GeologicFeature (eg, the dip of a fault), as defined by the IUGS Commission for Geoscience Information (CGI) Geoscience Terminology Working Group. By extension, it includes all concepts in this conceptScheme, as well as concepts in any previous versions of the scheme. Designed for use in the determinationMethod property in GeoSciML GSML_PlanarOrientation and GSML_LinearOrientation elements.
18617	Observation Method (Mapped Feature)	https://vocabs.ands.org.au/viewById/89	This file contains the CGI Observation Method (Mapped Feature) vocabulary, as defined by the IUGS Commission for Geoscience Information (CGI) Geoscience Terminology Working Group. These are terms that specify how a MappedFeature instance was mapped. MappedFeature ObservationMethod is essentially a metadata snippet indicating how the spatial extent of the mapped feature was determined, and the basis for association of the geometry with some GeologicFeature specification to define a MappedFeature. Observation method is a convenience property that provides a quick and dirty approach to shortcut use of more comprehensive observation and measurement construct when data are reported using a feature view (as opposed to observation view). By extension, this vocabulary includes all concepts in this conceptScheme, as well as concepts in any previous versions of the scheme.

18630	Global Industry Classification Standard	https://www.msci.com/gics	In 1999, MSCI and S&P Global developed the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), seeking to offer an efficient investment tool to capture the breadth, depth and evolution of industry sectors. GICS is a four-tiered, hierarchical industry classification system. It consists of 11 sectors, 24 industry groups, 68 industries and 157 sub-industries. Companies are classified quantitatively and qualitatively. Each company is assigned a single GICS classification at the sub-industry level according to its principal business activity. MSCI and S&P Global use revenues as a key factor in determining a firm’s principal business activity. Earnings and market perception, however, are also recognized as important and relevant information for classification purposes, and are taken into account during the annual review process.

18652	Cadastre and Land Administration Thesaurus	http://cadastralvocabulary.org/	Cadastre and Land Administration Thesaurus, shortly CaLAThe is a controlled vocabulary for the domain of cadastre and land administration. It is available at a dedicated web site: http://www.cadastralvocabulary.org, as well as through The Basic Register of Thesauri, Ontologies Classifications (BARTOC), the Definitions Server of the OGC, and from 2020 also linked with the LandVoc thesaurus. The initial 2011 version of CaLAThe was prepared based on terms and term relationships derived from DIS version of the ISO 19152:2012 Land Administration Domain Model (LADM). Moreover, it referred to existing thesauri, primarily the GEMET thesaurus, the AGROVOC thesaurus, and the STW Thesaurus for Economics. In the second version, terms rendering the dynamic or temporal aspects of the domain were added. Version 3 was supplemented with terms from the OGC Land and Infrastructure Conceptual Model Standard (LandInfra), and version 4 added code lists names and values from both standards. Version 5 started a multi-lingual itinerary by adding terms (SKOS: prefLabel) in Danish and Turkish, the native language of the authors. CaLAThe now comprises about 250 terms with a growing number of term definitions.
18653	LIDO Terminology Actor Type	http://terminology.lido-schema.org/actor_type	Indicates if the actor is an individual, a group of individuals, a family or an organization, such as a legal body, a corporation, or a firm.
18654	LIDO Terminology Event Type	http://terminology.lido-schema.org/eventType	The nature of the event associated with an object/work.
18655	LIDO Terminology Identifier Type	http://terminology.lido-schema.org/identifier_type	The type attribute of the LIDO Identifier Complex Type element qualifies the type of identifier used. Identifiers are assigned codes that are used to reference the resource being identified. Their scope may be either locally or globally unique and within that scope enable establishing comparison of equality. This vocabulary provides values for the type attribute of the following LIDO identifier elements: Published Object Identifier, LIDO Metadata Record-ID, Actor Identifier, Concept Identifier, Description/Descriptive Note Identifier, Event Identifier, Legal Body ID, Object Identifier, Place Identifier, Record Info ID, Record ID, Resource Identification Number.
18656	LIDO Terminology Record Metadata Date Type	http://terminology.lido-schema.org/recordMetadataDate_type	The Record Metadata Date Type-Vocabulary is a set of controlled terms recommended to use as values for the type attribute of the LIDO Record Metadata Date element.

18657	LIDO Terminology Record Type	http://terminology.lido-schema.org/recordType	The choice of the Record Type should take into account both the form or function of a document, an object or work of art, and the goal of the cataloging approach with respect to the logical arrangement of the whole and its parts.
18658	LIDO Terminology Repository Set Type	http://terminology.lido-schema.org/repositorySet_type	The LIDO Repository/Location Set Type-Vocabulary is a structured controlled list of terms recommended to use as values for the Repository/Location Set element. The type attribute indicates the kind of repository or location as the current or a former one.
18659	LIDO Terminology Resource Representation Type	http://terminology.lido-schema.org/resourceRepresentation_type	The type attribute of the LIDO Resource Representation element qualifies the digital representation of a resource offered by the data provider for online presentation. It is intended to support online services with respect to the reuse of digital resources that are referenced in the LIDO record. The controlled type vocabulary allows data providers to indicate which variant of a digital resource is described in an instance of the LIDO Resource Representation element. The vocabulary shall support common reuse scenarios such as presenting the digital resource in a search result list, in a detail view, or as downloadable media file. It may also be exploited for retrieval functions such as filtering search results by digital media types. The top-level terms are defined to distinguish between the best available variant of a digital resource the data provider can offer for online presentation (provided_representation), the variant a data provider has selected for preview purposes (preview_representation), and the image possibly provided as replacement for the digital resource (placeholder). The definitions of the subordinate terms additionally cover the digital media type. It is highly recommended to use one of the more specific terms, provided_3D, provided_audio, provided_image, provided_text or provided_video, to qualify the media type of the best available variant (or variants in case of equivalent quality), and correspondingly, preview_3D, preview_audio, preview_image, preview_text or preview_video, to distinguish the type of the preview variant (or variants in case of equivalent quality). Note that these terms do not imply any statement about the quality or format of a digital media file. Therefore, it is recommended to describe the media file in more detail by using the respective LIDO elements and attributes defined for the LIDO Resource Set. As a general recommendation, at a minimum the media file format should be specified by the LIDO formatResource attribute. Do not confuse the IANA Media Types, formerly known as MIME types, as used for the attribute formatResource with the media type defined as an attribute value for the LIDO Resource Representation element. While the former refers to the type and subtype of the actual media file (e.g., audio/mpeg, image/png, or text/html), the latter differentiates the digital resources by their intended use and generic kind of medium (e.g., provided_audio, preview_image, or provided_text). The use of the LIDO Resource Measurement Set may depend on specific use cases of an online service. It is recommended that partners in a data exchange or aggregation context reach an agreement about this. The vocabulary for the type attribute of the LIDO Resource Representation element does not provide terms to designate variants of digital resources with respect to data exchange in the long term preservation context. The vocabulary may be extended, if necessary.

18665	CAMEO Event Data Codebook	http://eventdata.parusanalytics.com/data.dir/cameo.html	CAMEO -- Conflict and Mediation Event Observations -- is the coding scheme we developed in conjunction with our research on third-party mediation. CAMEO has several new features not found in the WEIS system we have used in our earlier work: The coding scheme is optimized for the study of mediation and contains a number of tertiary sub-categories specific to mediation; We have substantially expanded the categories for 'use of force' and can therefore make much finer distinctions between reported levels of violence; We have combined a number of WEIS categories that, in our experience, cannot be reliably differentiated in machine coding; We have developed a systematic hierarchical coding scheme for dealing with substate actors; We have developed a very extensive taxonomy for religious groups and ethnic groups.
18666	Bibliographic Classification of all the Sciences		The BC consists of 14 main topics which are arranged in 25 main classes. This is achieved by dividing some topics, such as History and Literature, into a number of main classes. (...) The BC uses an alphanumeric system of notation which, as Schleiermacher himself pointed out, is a system that was well known in Europe before 1800. Frederik Rostgaard (...) used letters of the roman alphabet to identify main classes, and long before Rostgaard the system had been used in medieval cloister libraries. In the BC, following the single capital letters, a series of arabic numbers is used to identify subclasses.

18672	Controlled Vocabularies for the Asset Description Metadata Schema	https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/document/skos-used-publish-controlled-vocabularies-defined-adms-web	"SKOS, the Simple Knowledge Organisation System, is a common data model for sharing controlled vocabularies such as code lists, thesauri, and taxonomies via the Web in a machine-readable format. Recently, six new controlled vocabularies, specified as part of the Asset Description Metadata Schema v1.00 (ADMS), have been published on the Web using the SKOS vocabulary. The Asset Description Metadata Schema (v1.00) (ADMS) proposes six new controlled vocabularies (...), and specifies for each vocabulary and term corresponding purl.org term URIs (...):   Asset Type: e.g. “domain model”, “schema”, “taxonomy”;   Interoperability Level: e.g. “legal interoperability”, “organisational interoperability”, “semantic interoperability”, and “technical interoperability”;   Licence Type: e.g. ""attribution"", and ""no derivative work"";   Publisher Type: e.g. “company”, and “national authority”;   Representation Technique: e.g. “UML”, “XML Schema”, “Schematron”, “OWL”; and   Status: e.g. “completed”, and “under development”. These six controlled vocabularies have been published as “Linked Data” on the Web using the data model of the Simple Knowledge Organisation System (SKOS). SKOS is a lightweight RDF vocabulary that allows representing the terms in a controlled vocabulary as instances of the class skos:Concepts. SKOS also defines properties for multi-lingual labels (skos:prefLabel), associated codes (skos:notation), and definitions (skos:definition)."
18673	AnaEE Thesaurus	http://agroportal.lirmm.fr/ontologies/ANAEETHES	The AnaEE thesaurus aims to provide a controlled vocabulary for the semantic description of the study of continental ecosystems and their biodiversity.

18674	Thot - Thesauri & Ontology for documenting Ancient Egyptian Resources	http://thot.philo.ulg.ac.be/concept/	(...) the Department of Egyptology of the University of Liege, in collaboration with the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and the Saxon Academy of Sciences in Leipzig (Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae), is now developing Thot, a set of resources for documenting and encoding ancient Egyptian resources in a shared, interoperable approach. Moving towards Web Semantic and Linked Open Data, the resources that will be pushed online progressively will consist in a set of thesauri covering most of the metadata relating to ancient Egyptian texts and monuments, as well as a proposal for a TEI interchange format that enables exchange and sharing of textual data. (.) A first set of resources will consist in a wide range of multilingual thesauri related to documentary and textual metadata, aiming at providing controlled vocabularies and terms so that Egyptological projects with text and object focus will interoperate with each other in an easier way.
18675	FIBO Vocabulary	https://spec.edmcouncil.org/static/vocabulary/	The FIBO vocabulary is distributed using the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS). (...) The FIBO Vocabulary uses SKOS to provide a machine-readable dictionary of the FIBO terminology. (...) The FIBO Vocabulary is distributed as a machine-readable file in which the FIBO class hierarchy is rendered as a tree strucutre of broader and narrower terms. Properties in FIBO appear as properties in the FIBO vocabulary. Logical restrictions relating pairs of FIBO classes are rendered as simple relationships between corresponding concepts in FIBO Vocabulary. The FIBO Vocabulary therefore does not reflect the full richness of the FIBO Ontologies, and is provided to support knowledge organization applications that do not require the full logic of FIBO. The FIBO Vocabulary machine-readable files are intended to provide input to a range of tools, usually characterized as Glossary or Vocabulary tools. These tools are generally used to provide further business-facing presentations of the content of these files.
18676	LandVoc - the Linked Land Governance Thesaurus	https://landvoc.org	The Land Portal Foundation has taken the lead in the land governance sector to develop such a standardized vocabulary: LandVoc, the Linked Land Governance Thesaurus. LandVoc is mainly derived from FAO's Agrovoc (link is external), the standard Agriculture vocabulary, but links together many other vocabularies designed and/or used by land governance stakeholders on both a global and local level. LandVoc is always a working product, constantly being reviewed and improved. It is important to emphasize that LandVoc is not meant to serve as a glossary for land governance-related issues. The Thesaurus is purely meant to standardize the classification of content and resources, to improve the discoverability of and access to land-related information, from both global and grassroots sources, from all over the world.
18677	Land Portal Resource Types	https://landportal.org/library/resource-type/	The Land Portal's Land Library contains highly curated metadata of over 20,000 land-related publications, articles and multimedia. The Land Portal aggregates this metadata from over 20 different sources, in addition to the resources that are added by users manually. In order to combine these different databases that the Land Portal harvests metadata from, the Land Portal has needed to consolidate certain elements from these different databases to fit one standardized metadata structure in the Land Portal's Land Library. One of the elements in metadata about resources that the Land Portal curates, is the type of resource. Many organizations and information providers use different terminologies to describe the types of resources they publish. The Land Portal has therefore created several broad categories of resource types, to be able to consolidate these various classifications. Below you can find the list of resource types the Land Portal uses, along with a short description of what is meant with each category.
18678	Step by Step Classification	https://www.amazon.com/Step-Classification-Formula-Based-Volumes/dp/8193359798	Step by Step Classification (SSC) is a formula-based library classification scheme. The classification number (CN) of a document can be derived based on a single formula CN = I date. Each letter I date is an element representing discipline, area, time, and extra information respectively covered in the text of the classifying document. Each element is prefixed to the respective class number which is useful in locating a document in the library. To provide classification numbers certain devices like NDA, CD, and LDD are provided. Hence all types of documents in any physical form can be classified. SSC allows for sufficient space to classify newly emerging disciplines which may be developed in the future. Language is not a barrier to classify documents; classification numbers can be allotted to any language with the help of NDA numbers. This formula will be useful for deriving computerized classification numbers. The same formula may also be used in other fields as mentioned in theory.

The structure subsequently given to that terminology was the result of a systematic study performed by subject specialists at the INIS Secretariat and several Member States. Further expansion of the thesaurus terminology was done by ETDE to incorporate information on all forms of energy.

The index, however, should never be used as a classification tool on its own. It is essential that the actual schedules are checked to ensure that the context of the given classification number is appropriate for the document in hand. For example, TRANSACTIONAL ANALYSIS, originally a psychotherapeutic technique used for mental disorder, is now used in a number of other settings and it would be inappropriate to classify these in the Psychiatry Schedules. The terminology used in the annotated index is based on the NLM Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), and the tree structure in which it sits is indicated below the heading (e.g. L1).

18800	Historical International Standard Classification of Occupations	https://historyofwork.iisg.nl/	Starting in the 1950s the International Labour Office has developed an International Standard Classification of Occupations (isco) allowing classification of occupational activities worldwide. Naturally, this system is not intended to deal with historical information. In recent years, a group of historians and sociologists have started to build upon the 1968 version of isco to create a classification scheme for occupational titles in the 19th and early 20th centuries, called hisco (...). It is tailored to cope with historical changes in the production process, and allows storage of information on product and status that could not be accommodated in isco. Large historical databases from which the hisco-data are taken and the international association of historians working on censuses have already agreed to adopt it, an many individual researchers are expected to do so as well. Altogether, the HISCO scheme was originally based on the coding of the 1,000 most frequent male and female occupational titles in datasets from eight different countries: Belgium, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. The occupational data which were employed to develop the scheme span the period 1690-1970, but are mostly from the nineteenth century. They contain titles declared by or recorded for people of all ages in parish and civil registration documents. The data used to create HISCO encompass the largest country in western Europe, the world’s first industrial nation, the two most influential of the Scandinavian territories, and a newly-settled region of French-Canada. This, and an emphasis on variations within economies in sampling design, ensures that they provide a good mix of agricultural, industrial and commercial activities, of old and new technologies, of traditional and modern forms of organization. Moreover, the inclusion of two French-speaking populations, and a further region in which the official language was French, provides an effective test of the HISCO scheme’s sensitivity to the relationship between language and meaning. Nevertheless, the scheme is currently limited in coverage to the Northern European and Atlantic economies. Future development of the scheme will broaden its scope. To this end, the coding of new data into HISCO is being undertaken in several other countries. The History of Work Information System has a coding section that helps users code their data in HISCO, and thus both make it comparable to other datasets, and make it of use to other scholars. The Provenance file lists all contributors to the HISCO-database.
18801	OLAC Video Game Vocabulary	https://www.olacinc.org/olac-video-game-vocabulary	Video games are extremely popular materials held by both public libraries and academic libraries.

The OLAC video game genre vocabulary includes sixty-six genre terms, each with a scope note to help librarians choose the correct term when cataloging video games. The vocabulary is fully cross-referenced and includes authoritative sources to corroborate the usage of the genre term as applied to video games. (...) The OLAC video game genre vocabulary has been assigned the MARC source code of olacvggt for use in identifying the source of vocabulary genre terms assigned in bibliographic records for individual video game titles. The designated olacvggt code appears in the Genre/Form Code and Term Source Codes list which is maintained by the Library of Congress, http://www.loc.gov/standards/sourcelist/genre-form.html. (...)

1881	Multilingual Dictionary of Cataloguing Terms and Concepts		The Multilingual dictionary of cataloguing terms and concepts contains definitions for many terms and concepts used by the library cataloguing community. Terms and definitions are available in English and a variety of other languages. The MulDiCat project was begun by Monika Muennich in 1998 for IFLA's Cataloguing Section. It was stored in a proprietary database developed by Bernard Eversberg in 2003. It has now re-emerged in part as a Word table and as a SKOS file on the new IFLA Namespace. It is intended to be used for authoritative translations of IFLA cataloguing standards and related documents. The terms reflect international agreements on terms to use for these cataloguing and classification concepts -- in particular, the agreements reached during the IME ICC (IFLA Meetings of Experts on an International Cataloguing Code) that reviewed FRBR, FRAD, and ISBD terminology while developing the International Cataloguing Principles (ICP). As additional official translations of ICP are added to IFLANET, MulDiCat has been updated to include terms in these additional languages. Other terms will be added as IFLA reaches international agreement for them through the work of the Cataloguing Section and the Classification & Indexing Sections, as well as other units throughout IFLA interested and involved in bibliographic standards.

18819	UPIANA Classification Scheme	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PYqt4L7-aTEkpilayhF-X9AHcmlJw583ugT86urDUqg/	The UPIANA Classification Schedule forms part of a set of three special classification schedules developed by the Cataloging and Metadata Services Section of the University of the Philippines Diliman University Library. It was designed to meet an urgent need in the classification of its various special collections. While the University Library has chosen to adopt the United States Library of Congress Classification Schedules (LCC), catalogers have found it to be inadequate in handling most of the Filipiniana materials. (...) UPIANA is defined to include all officially published and/or unpublished materials emanating from and/or pertaining to the University of the Philippines System. The classification schedule developed in 1961 expanded the LC schedule for individual institutions offering higher education. Since then, it has undergone numerous revisions in order to incorporate the additions and changes in the University organization. Notable revisions of the schedule were carried out in 1975 by Vyva M. Aguirre as part of her Master of Library Science special problem, and by the C Section in 1982 and 2000. This present publication includes the additions and changes made as of March 2018. It does not cover serial publications which, as a standard practice, are not classified, nor does it provide for publications by individual faculty members, alumni, and students of the University on specific subject fields as these are preferably classified under the various classes in the LC Scheme. The UPIANA Classification Schedule is a customized scheme for the University of the Philippines System that may be adopted and or used as a model by other higher education institution libraries with similar needs. Like the LC Scheme, it is found to be functional and logically designed to serve as an organizing system for special and local collections. It is envisioned that libraries who are just beginning to develop similar schemes would find this tool useful for their own purpose.

We are very grateful for their permission to use MeSH in this way. For this edition 2004 MeSH has been used. Within the Department the Thesaurus has been used for the subject metadata element for the Departmental internet, to structure the relationship of terms in the Senior's Portal consumer website, to provide the automatic match of search terms for consumer health access in the HealthInsite gateway, and to give quality subject retrieval in the Library catalogue - which in turn allows easier access to Departmental and other publications. The Thesaurus is also used by a number of health related organisations in Australia.

1889	IUPAC Compendium of Polymer Terminology and Nomenclature		The IUPAC system of polymer nomenclature has aided the generation of unambiguous names that reflect the historical development of chemistry. However, the explosion in the circulation of information and the globalization of human activities mean that it is now necessary to have a common language for use in legal situations, patents, export-import regulations, and environmental health and safety information. Rather than recommending a 'unique name' for each structure, rules have been developed for assigning 'preferred IUPAC names', while continuing to allow alternatives in order to preserve the diversity and adaptability of nomenclature. This new edition of the 'Purple Book' (...) collects into a single volume the most important papers on the nomenclature and terminology of most polymers, including Regular Single-Strand Organic Polymers, Regular Double-Strand (Ladder and Spiro) Organic Polymers, and Irregular Single-Strand Organic Polymers. The scope has been extended to include papers on terminology for polymers. It is a handy compendium for scientists and is invaluable for those professionals working in this field.

18898	KBpedia	http://kbpedia.org/	KBpedia is a comprehensive knowledge structure for promoting data interoperability and knowledge-based artificial intelligence, or KBAI. The KBpedia knowledge structure combines seven 'core' public knowledge bases — Wikipedia, Wikidata, schema.org, DBpedia, GeoNames, OpenCyc, and UMBEL — into an integrated whole. KBpedia's upper structure, or knowledge graph, is the KBpedia Knowledge Ontology. We base KKO on the universal categories and knowledge representation theories of the great 19th century American logician, polymath and scientist, Charles Sanders Peirce. KBpedia, written primarily in OWL 2, includes 55,000 reference concepts, mapped linkages to about 32 million entities (most from Wikidata), and 5,000 relations and properties, all organized according to about 70 modular typologies that can be readily substituted or expanded. We test candidates added to KBpedia using a rigorous (but still fallible) suite of logic and consistency tests — and best practices — before acceptance. The result is a flexible and computable knowledge graph that can be sliced-and-diced and configured for all sorts of machine learning tasks, including supervised, unsupervised and deep learning. KBpedia, KKO and its mapped information can drive multiple use cases such as providing a computable framework over Wikipedia and Wikidata, creating word embedding models, fine-grained entity recognition and tagging, relation and sentiment extractors, and categorization. Knowledge-based AI models may be set up and refined with unprecedented speed and accuracy by leveraging the integrated KBpedia structure.

In the text of the Compendium there are, occasionally, contradicting definitions which result from the fact that the experts of different fields - while trying to do their best-hold different views on certain key issues. One of the missions of this Compendium may be to stimulate a higher level of conformity and communication between the experts in rapidly developing areas of science.

A field of study includes a partition of a knowledge- or topic area, where similar study courses are compiled. Multiple fields of study belong to a certain study area and multiple study areas belong to a subject group. In the Hochschulkompass all possibilities for studying are structured around knowledge- or topic areas, meaning that you are able to start at subject group and go down the ladder step-by-step until you find the courses you want."

1899	Physics Subject Headings	https://physh.aps.org/	PhySH (Physics Subject Headings) is a physics classification scheme developed by the American Physical Society to organize journals, meetings, and other content by topic. The development of PhySH is motivated by the lack of a fully open, high quality classification scheme for physics. It is intended initially to meet the specific goals of the APS for our journal, meeting, and other content. A longer term goal is to make it available for use by the broader community. (...) Right now, the main use of PhySH is to classify manuscripts within the APS peer-review process and, ultimately, published journal articles. The assigned concepts will be used for ensuring articles are routed to the most appropriate handling editor who is knowledgeable in that area. They also help editors in finding similar articles previously submitted and in finding suitable referees. As one might expect with something so new, the refinement of PhySH is still very much underway. The facets and disciplines have been identified and almost 3,000 concepts have been added to PhySH through an iterative process that is still ongoing. Many APS journal editors are involved in this process, primarily by lending their expertise in the various subfields in physics. The assignment of concepts to the various facets can be rather subjective. Thus, we expect to make many adjustments to PhySH as we receive feedback from the community (especially authors using PhySH to classify their submissions) and as we incorporate PhySH into the APS journal websites. As we iteratively refine PhySH over the coming months, the rate of new concept additions, concept reassignments within facets, and new relationships among concepts should abate significantly.
19	Humanities and Social Science Electronic Thesaurus (retired and replaced by ELSST in January 2025)	https://elsst.cessda.eu/	"For many years UKDS studies have been indexed with terms from the Humanities and Social Science Electronic Thesaurus (HASSET). HASSET has been ‘retired’ in January 2025, and HASSET keywords in the UKDS catalogue have been replaced with keywords from the European Language Social Science Thesaurus (ELSST). The decision to change over to ELSST was taken as ELSST is more up to date and is reviewed regularly, due to dedicated funding. Also, ELSST is versioned, meaning that outdated concepts (keywords) are deprecated, not deleted. This is important for the application of the FAIR principles, as deprecated concepts are still linkable in the thesaurus. Previous abstract until January 2025: ""The Humanities and Social Science Electronic Thesaurus (HASSET) is the leading British English thesaurus for the social sciences. It was originally developed from the UNESCO thesaurus, becoming a separate product in 1997. HASSET is a working tool for the keyword annotation and retrieval of UK Data Service data. It consists of over 4,000 concepts and covers the core social science disciplines: politics, sociology, economics, education, law, crime, demography, health, employment, information and communication technology, history and, increasingly, environmental science. The thesaurus can be used to find studies in the UK Data Service Data Catalogue. These studies include large-scale government surveys, international macrodata, business microdata, qualitative studies, historical studies and census data. Revisions to HASSET concepts and structures aim to keep abreast with developments in social science and humanities."

But one could have never heard a note of Bowie’s music (including his new album) and still be wowed by the extent to which the man’s various guises have, as you can see here, inspired a multitude of artists. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Bowie should be blushing.

1908	Decimal System for Classifying Data Pertaining to the Petroleum Industry	http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015021085355	The 'Decimal Classification' was first printed by the National Petroleum Publishing Company, publishers of National Petroleum News, in 1928. A second edition appeared in serial form in The Petroleum Engineer in 1938 and was later reprinted in booklet form. During the intervening years since it was first available, many persons apparently have found this system useful in meeting their filing problems. Articles printed in The Petroleum Engineer have for many years been numbered in accordance with this decimal classification to facilitate orderly clipping and filing. It has also found use in oil company offices and libraries where filing of petroleum technology reference material is a day-to-day problem. (...) From the standpoint of one interested in some specialized industry, such as petroleum, the system developed by Dewey is too broad. Being all inclusive, it subordinates the particular things in which we are interested to the main divisions of knowledge in such a way that much of our material is widely scattered. The decimal classification given in the following pages is modeled after the plan used by Dewey, except that all knowledge is subordinated to the field of petroleum technology, to which the whole classification applies. It is intended to provide an orderly and systematic arrangement of reference material for individuals whose chief interest lies in the field of petroleum technology. The main framework of the classification is indicated in the abridged list of 100 topics or subdivisions of petroleum technology (...). In the complete index, which appears on later pages, each division in this list is divided into ten subdivisions, thus providing 1, 000 topics with a number between 0 and 1, 000 assigned to each. Each number is followed by a decimal point, and additional digits may be added to the right of the decimal point if our needs require more detailed classification. The decimal point is used merely for convenience in reading and has no special significance. An effort has been made to include in the classification a number for every topic of any importance pertaining to the petroleum and related industries. When topics have been overlooked, it should be easy to extend the classification, where necessary, by providing a number that would place the topic in its proper sequence with relation to other topics.

1912	Cutter Expansive Classification	http://forbeslibrary.org/research/cutter-classification/	Charles Ammi Cutter (1837–1903), inspired by the decimal classification of his contemporary Melvil Dewey, originally developed his own classification scheme for the collections of the Boston Athenaeum, at which he served as librarian for two dozen years. He began work on it about 1880 and published the first schedules in the early 1890s. His five-volume catalogue of the Athenaeum collection is a classic in bibliographic history. The Cutter classification, although adopted by comparatively few libraries, mostly in New England, has been called one of the most logical and scholarly of American classifications. Its outline served as a basis for the Library of Congress classification, which also took over some of its features. It did not catch on as did Dewey's system because Cutter died before it was completely finished, making no provision for the kind of development necessary as the bounds of knowledge expanded and scholarly emphases changed throughout the 20th century.

1916	IWRF Functional Classification System	http://www.iwrf.com/?page=classification	Wheelchair Rugby, with roots in wheelchair basketball and ice hockey, began in Canada in the 1970s as a counterpart to wheelchair basketball for persons with tetraplegia or tetra-equivalent function. The first classification system was medically based and there were three classes, largely determined by medical diagnosis and level of spinal cord injury. In 1991, the system was changed to a functional classification system unique to the sport of wheelchair rugby. This was done for many reasons, including the need to have a system that would accommodate the growing number of athletes both with and without spinal cord injury (such as polio, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis and amputations).

Using LibraryThing's fielded bibliographic wiki, Common Knowledge. And include: • Progressive development Written ""level-by-level"" (DDC's classes, divisions, etc.), in a process of discussion, schedule proposals, adoption of a tentative schedule, collaborative assignment of a large number of books, statistical testing, more discussion, revision and 'solidification'. • Public-library focus Academic collections, being larger, are less likely to change to a new system. Also, academic collections mostly use the Library of Congress System, which is already in the public domain. • Statistical testing As far as we are aware, no classification system has ever been tested statistically as it was built. Yet there are various interesting ways of doing just that. For example, it would be good to see how a proposed shelf-order matches up against other systems, like DDC, LCC, LCSH and tagging. If a statistical cluster in one of these systems ends up dispersed in OSC, why? (...) The OSC Project is a collaborative effort by LibraryThing members."

1946	Billings Classification	http://billi.nypl.org/	The Billings Classification is a subject classification developed by John Shaw Billings in 1899. It was not an abstract experiment in the mapping of human knowledge, but rather a system devised specifically for the optimum arrangement of the Library’s collections. Dr. Billings envisioned a layout for the building, and while his classification scheme was in fact a division of human intellectual achievement into various subject areas designated by letter codes varying in number (usually three), it was fashioned in such a way as to maximize access to the unique holdings of the Library. The planned physical space—how things would function—all played a role in the construction of his classification. The majority of the Billings classmarks are not longer in use, as NYPL began using a fixed order system in the 1950s.
1947	Fintech Taxonomy	http://vedanvi.com/fintech-taxonomy-map/	Fintech is a broad category describing an entire market. And it’s quite hard to try and get your head around this rapidly evolving market. But knowing the landscape can have great advantages:   • If you are just starting out, it will give you a good idea of what’s working and what is not, and more importantly, which segment provides the opportunity for fastest growth;   • If you are already a Fintech pioneer, then knowing the landscape will help you explore market gaps for expansion or diversification;   • You will have a much better handle on new and emerging competitors, threatening your business model; and   • If you are an incumbent player, then knowledge of the landscape will help you identify acquisition or joint venture partnering opportunities, as a way to entering or getting exposure to the exciting world of    Fintech.  To make sense of this market and for your benefit, we have already started to map out the Fintech landscape, or Fintech taxonomy, as there just isn’t enough information out there. (...) The map is divided across seven distinct functional lines covering the entire financial services landscape. The World Economic Forum research identified the first five and we added the last two categories to include suppliers and intermediaries.
1949	Aves - A Taxonomy in Flux	http://jboyd.net/Taxo/taxo1.html	There are big changes underway in bird taxonomy. You've probably noticed that the checklist is always changing. Suddenly the ducks have replaced the loons in front of the NGS guide. Not too long ago the shrikes and vireos were next to the warblers, now they're next to the jays. Maybe you've heard that vultures are storks, or that they're not really storks after all, or that North American tanagers are now cardinals, or that saltators are tanagers, not cardinals. Then there are the Baltimore and Bullock's Orioles, or are they just Northern Orioles? Are they Slate-colored and Oregon Juncos, or maybe it's Dark-eyed Junco today. Not only are species being split or lumped, but everything is being rearranged. A new view of bird taxonomy takes shape as we watch. There have always been questions and disagreements about bird taxonomy, and it has always been changing (see Bruce, 2003). Since Aristotle or before, people have tried to find a natural way to order all bird species (the very words 'genus' and 'species' carry the Aristotelean tradition). Early attempts were based on obvious similarities, such as grouping all waterbirds together. But what constitutes a natural order? Linnaeus simplified scientific nomenclature by naming each type bird with a genus and species, but was unable to tell us what order was natural. It is not until Darwin that we get a clearcut way to order the birds. They should be ordered according to descent. Birds with more recent common ancestors should be grouped together. Thomas Huxley (1867) was the first to construct a comprehensive bird list on Darwinian lines. He focused on the characteristics of the bird's skull to determine common inherited features that he could base his taxonomy on. Numerous other ornithologists have used morphological traits to classify the birds, with Livezey and Zusi (2007) being the most recent effort of this type. More recently, focus has shifted to molecular methods, the most important of which is to directly study the stuff of inheritance—DNA. The culmination of the first wave of DNA based taxonomy were the publications by Sibley, Ahlquist, and Monroe (Sibley, Ahlquist, and Monroe, 1988; Sibley and Ahlquist, 1990; Sibley and Monroe, 1990). Sibley, Ahlquist, and Monroe used DNA hybridization to try to classify birds. This, together with increasing emphasis on cladistic methods, has revitalized interest in bird taxonomy. In the 1990's, DNA hybridization was replaced by the much more precise DNA sequencing, allowing direct examination of the genes themselves. This has opened the possibility of constructing a 'tree of life' showing the evolutionary relationships between all living organisms. It has brought the prospect of producing a completely accurate taxonomic tree of all living bird species, and touched off an onslaught of new research. This ongoing research is the driving force behind the checklist changes. This set of web pages contains a guess at what the avian part of the tree of life might look like. It examines recent taxonomic changes, and possible changes to come. Some of the projected changes are pretty solid, others are guesses based on current research. Keep in mind that some of my guesses will turn out to be wrong, and some of the research they are based will be wrong or misleading. There will doubtless be taxonomic surprises before the entire avian tree is worked out, just as there have been a number of recent surprises.

1955	CRS Legislative Subject Terms Used in THOMAS		Beginning with the 111th Congress, all legislative measures are assigned at least one Subject term drawn from a new list of terms presented on this page. The Subject terms are designed to better group legislation, to improve consistency, and to shorten the time it takes to add Subject terms to bills. Subject terms can also be assigned from a large list of terms corresponding to geographic areas (foreign and domestic), U.S. government entities, and congressional committees. See the CRS Named-Entity Subject Terms for a complete list of those terms. Subject term assignment is cumulative; that is, it is added to in order to reflect revisions (if any) made to the measure as it moves through the legislative process. When looking at the Subject terms assigned to a bill or resolution, you will notice that the first term on the list appears out of alphabetical order. This is the Top Term for the measure, and it corresponds to the broad category that best describes the concerns of the measure's text. Top Terms are represented by the bold 'umbrella' terms on the list below. Terms assigned to legislation from the 110th and earlier Congresses came from a list that was based upon a thesaurus known as the Legislative Indexing Vocabulary (LIV). CRS plans to convert the LIV terms assigned to bills from the 93rd through the 110th Congresses to the new Subject terms as time and resources permit.
1956	CRS Named-Entity Subject Terms Used in THOMAS	http://thomas.loc.gov/help/terms-names.html	Legislative analysts from the Congressional Research Service (CRS) closely examine the content of each bill and resolution and assign (index) as many Subject terms as are required to describe the measure's substance and effects. Beginning with the 111th Congress, all legislative measures are assigned at least one Subject term drawn from the terms presented at CRS Legislative Subject Terms. Searchable Subjects also include a large number of terms corresponding to geographic areas (foreign and domestic), U.S. government entities, and congressional committees shown in the list below.

1960	Glossary on Assisted Reproductive Technology Terminology	http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/infertility/art_terminology.pdf	Many definitions used in medically assisted reproduction (MAR) vary in different settings, making it difficult to standardize and compare procedures in different countries and regions. With the expansion of infertility interventions worldwide, including lower resource settings, the importance and value of a common nomenclature is critical. The objective is to develop an internationally accepted and continually updated set of definitions, which would be utilized to standardize and harmonize international data collection, and to assist in monitoring the availability, efficacy, and safety of assisted reproductive technology (ART) being practiced worldwide. (...)

1962	Database of historical persons, things (lemma) and place names	https://www.ssrq-sds-fds.ch/typo3/index.php?id=132	"The goal of this project is to develop a database for historical persons, places and concepts - and relationships between them - for the collection of Swiss sources of law."" The database is intended to allow all relevant information (ie, Which are contained in the printed registers) in a structured form, and it should also be possible to produce printed registers for individual volumes from these data.  In order to enable as many future applications as possible, it is crucial that the information can be processed mechanically. For this purpose, they must not only exist as unstructured texts, but must be stored as structured data with precisely defined semantics. """""

1971	Glossary of Terms Relating to Thesauri and Other Forms of Structured Vocabulary for Information Retrieval	http://www.willpowerinfo.co.uk/glossary.htm	Confusion often arises when different people use terms to mean different things. In drawing up the following list I am grateful for suggestions and comments from three consultant colleagues who specialise in the development and use of thesauri and other forms of structured vocabulary for information retrieval: Stella Dextre Clarke, Alan Gilchrist and Ron Davies. I have tried as far as possible to maintain consistency with definitions which we drafted for the revised British standards for thesaurus construction (BS 8723:2005 Structured vocabularies for information retrieval) and have taken some account of the definitions in the USA national standard, Z39.19. I do not claim that these definitions are 'correct' and that other meanings are 'wrong', but I hope that they will be found to be a consistent and well-defined set which will aid communication by encouraging everyone to use the same words with the same meaning. Discussions about some of the definitions are continuing, and they may change. Some of the definitions, notes and examples are my personal suggestions, and my colleagues may not agree with them.
1972	Information Architecture Glossary	http://argus-acia.com/white_papers/iaglossary.html	This glossary is intended to foster development of a shared vocabulary within the new and rapidly evolving field of information architecture. It should serve as a valuable reference for anyone involved with or interested in the design of information architectures for web sites, intranets and other information systems. Although this may seem obvious, we want to make it clear that the terms in this glossary are defined in relation to the field of information architecture. We have attempted to be faithful to the ordinary usage of terms to the degree possible. However, as with any specialty, some common words are used in somewhat uncommon ways within this field, and it is those meanings we have tried to capture. Defining information architecture is an important and controversial challenge.

Thus, the systematic bibliography of Hittitology is based, the last period of which was the starting point of this new data collection. Within the framework of a small project funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), the extensive older part of the bibliography for the system was developed, corrected and supplemented between 2009 and the beginning of 2012. The processed material should, as far as possible, open up all the hitherto literature from the beginning, especially since the beginning of the 20th century. The classification and arrangement system corresponds to that of the systematic bibliography of the Hethitology of V. Souček and J. Siegelová, which divided the literature into nine large groups - general, archeology, writing, languages, geography, social, history, religion, cultural history. Within these groups a finer arrangement is then made according to the thematic orientation of the works to be treated, with the aim that the increasing amounts of data remain clear, accessible and user-friendly. The complete overview of the classification can be found in the introductory table. By clicking on the individual links in the decimal scheme, the individual topics can be opened. However, there are only a few publications focusing on a single problem. It is a great advantage of the electronic processing of bibliographical data that the works can be recorded in several relevant places and can be referenced by links. The basic classification, of course, is guided by the main theme. The broadening topics or the questions which are treated only in an additional way in the respective work are taken into account by the publication in the corresponding chapter 'under the line', ie. Only after the works in which the relevant problem circle is the focus.

The enacted BEC was basically composed of 19 categories to respond to the final classification of use used by the System of National Accounts (SNA), such as capital goods, intermediate goods, and consumer goods systems. The enacted BEC has organized a classification system exclusively for goods. Since its enactment, it has been revised based on classification tables and explanatory materials four times, reflecting the revision results of SITC and HS, which are related product categories. The first and second amendments to the U.N. recommended were table amendments that reflected the SITC amendments, the third correction corrected errors in the BEC technology, and the fourth amendment was made with the relevant table amendments that reflected the HS amendments. The revision of the BEC was carried out in parallel with the revision of the KCPC (Korea Goods and Service Classification) in March 2018, and the final revision classification system was finalized and operated in December 2018 after three rounds of meetings with statistical authorities and public opinion collection and classification experts.

20093	Korean Standard Classification of Occupations	http://kssc.kostat.go.kr/	It is the job classification that systematically types what individuals are doing for income (economic activities) according to the type of work performed, and the Korean Standard Classification of Occupations (KSCO) is standardized to suit the job structure and status of Korea. The Korean standard occupation classification is based on the ability to carry out the tasks and tasks of a given job, and is considering the job level and type of job. Skill level refers to the height of job performance, which is determined by regular education, vocational training, vocational experience, and innate ability and socio-cultural environment. Skill specialization relates to the field of knowledge required to perform a task, the tools and equipment used, the raw materials input, and the types of goods or services produced. An occupation is a group of jobs that have similar task similarities. Distinguishing a set of tasks from other occupations and classifying them into the same profession presupposes a degree of similarity, which is equivalent to presenting job-specific job exclusivity that defines different tasks. However, it is very difficult to determine task-specific similarities and exclusivity due to the complexity of job performance conditions and the gap in job scope due to differences in the size of the enterprise. The criteria for task similarity include knowledge, experience, and skill required by the person performing the task, as well as the skill requirements required by the person performing the task. Sometimes, the characteristics of companies where professionals mainly work, the process of production, or the final output, are important. Non-similar jobs can be called different jobs because the requirements of exclusivity are met, and if the labor market formation varies from job to job, it can be said that they have the most obvious exclusivity. In addition, the size of employment by job is also a realistic criterion in the task categorization criterion. The Korean Standard Occupational Classification was established based on the employment of at least 1,000 people in the class unit, and 5,000 to 10,000 people are believed to be distributed in the class with a large number of employees.
20094	Korean Employment Classification of Occupations	https://kssc.kostat.go.kr:8443/ksscNew_web/kssc/common/ClassificationContent.do?gubun=1&strCategoryNameCode=038&categoryMenu=007&addGubun=no	The Korean Employment Classification of Occupations (KECO) is a systematic classification of jobs that reflects labor market conditions, demand, and realistic job structures. This is used for statistical purposes to aggregate and compare the results of employment-related administrative DBs or statistical survey data.

20098	Korea Classification of Status in Employment	http://kssc.kostat.go.kr/	Korea Classification of Status in Employment (KCSE) was created to classify an individual's occupation and the type of employment contract they have at a given point in time. This classification is used to analyze employment structures and labor markets. The labor relationship between a worker and the economic unit where the work is carried out includes not only explicit employment contracts made with other individuals or organizations, but also implicitly established employment contracts. Classification Scope Following the international standard (ICSE-18), the relationship between the worker and the economic unit performing the work is classified according to two factors: the type of authority and the type of economic risk. - Type of Authority: This classification is based on the nature of the control a worker has over their work organization. - Type of Economic Risk: This classification is based on the degree to which a worker is exposed to financial and other resource losses during their work activities, as well as the likelihood of not receiving compensation. Classification History - Established in 2008 - First revision in January 2021

2010	Basic Concepts Classification	https://sites.google.com/a/ualberta.ca/rick-szostak/research/basic-concepts-classification-web-version-2013	The purpose of the Basic Concepts Classification is first to identify an extensive and hierarchically organized set of ‘basic concepts’: concepts that can readily be understood across disciplines and cultures. Second, all scholarly works can be classified in terms of combinations of these basic concepts. The Basic Concepts Classification thus provides a basis for a universal non-discipline-based classification. There are three broad types of basic concept. Most basic concepts refer to real (or abstract) ‘things’ (phenomena) in the world (or to properties of those things). Yet there are also various relationships among things. Since the bulk of scholarly research -- and much of the general literature as well -- analyses how one or more things influence (or are related in other ways to) one or more other things, it is desirable to classify such works in terms of combinations of basic concepts. An important minority of scholarly works discusses the properties of one or more things or relationships. These adjective/adverbial properties form a third group of basic concepts. These properties can be combined with both things and relationships to more precisely capture the important elements of both types of work.

20129	2016 Terms of Custom Tariff	https://unipass.customs.go.kr/clip/index.do?opnurl=/ctensrch/openULS0404017Q.do	Imports of overseas Internet shopping (also known as direct overseas shopping) amounted to 1.7 trillion won in 2015. Consumers will choose to purchase directly overseas if the price of the goods is cheaper than in Korea, considering the price, tariffs and delivery costs of the goods. At this time, I wanted to know the estimated tariff amount of the goods I wanted to purchase, but it was difficult to check the tariff rate because the terms in the tariff rate table were different from the terms used in real life. The tariff rate requires the item number on the tariff rate table. However, many jargon is used in the tariff table because it follows the classification system under international agreements. This booklet explains the jargon of the tariff table in an encyclopedia definition and a picture of goods, and links the name of the tariff table used in daily life with the name of the tariff table through the index table, making it easier for the general public to understand the tariff table.

Furthermore, in addition to the tariff rate table documentation, careful consideration is required, such as criteria for application of item classification, comments on HS classification, and regulations related to item classification by other departments.

20143	Terms of Taekwondo Skills	http://research.kukkiwon.or.kr/homepage/boardMedia/11637	Taekwondo technical terms were not easy to name new technologies due to their lack of consistency and unity, and the same technology was sometimes called differently by different people. Also, it is hard to learn because the terms are long, and it is difficult for foreigners to follow in Korean. Meanwhile, the need for a standard vocabulary book for taekwondo has become more urgent as the terms of competition and demonstration have not been properly organized in the textbook, causing confusion of terms by team or demonstration team. Accordingly, Kukkiwon collects and reviews the various terms used in the painting and the stadium, selects 138 standard terms, and publishes a glossary with descriptions of each technique. The standard terms in Taekwondo Technical Glossary have realized consistency, unity and simplicity of terms.

This dictionary actively displays ""cross reference"" to strengthen its role as a guide to the dictionary so that readers can actively create a knowledge system. Interconnecting interrelated information functions to help readers proactively expand their knowledge. In particular, since the field of narrative has a lot of stories involved, cross-references that can immediately be used to find relevant headlines scattered can be used. In addition, the same story is often referred to differently, and in such cases, ""household control"" was set up so that the reader could easily access the heading."
20164	Encyclopedia of Korean Folklore and Traditional Culture:Household Religion	https://folkency.nfm.go.kr/topic/directory	"The Korean Folklore and Faith Dictionary has set its direction to strengthen the independence of individual headlines. These directions are designed to address the topic of the heading, but also to describe the peripheral matters that are important to understand the heading, so that the control of the table alone can comprehensively and in depth understand the content. In other words, the independence of individual headings was strengthened without stratifying the volume and scope of the content. The ""Muksok Sinpyeon"" and ""Village Sinpyeon"" were compiled in this direction, and the newly published home faith episode also followed this direction. In other words, a total of 248 headings were selected in seven categories, divided into sacrificial, physical, ritual, sacrificial, data, and terms. The overall composition of the dictionary is the same as that of the ""Muksangpyeon"" and the ""Muksangpyeon."" In other words, the table control arrangement was arranged in alphabetical order, and the table of contents was largely arranged in alphabetical order and by field. Kanada charye is a common dictionary search method that provides relatively convenient access to the title word. At the same time, the combination of turns by field is designed to make it easy to grasp the overall composition of the ""fake mind"" and to allow readers to see the areas of interest at a glance. For example, if you are interested in offering, you can see the offering at a glance through each field's turn, and through this, you can find the title word."

20169	Encyclopedia of Korean Seasonal Customs:Supplement	https://folkency.nfm.go.kr/topic	Encyclopedia of Korean Seasonal Customs: Supplement is a part of the Encyclopedia of Korean Seasonal Customs in the Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture. It is composed of two sections: the index and the white paper. The Encyclopedia of Korean Seasonal Customs has been published in four volumes, divided according to the characteristics of seasonal customs that follow the cycle of the four seasons: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. However, since the first month of the lunar calendar, Jeongwol (the lunar January), is the period with the most seasonal customs, it has been published as a separate volume. This encyclopedia is mainly divided into lunar and solar calendars. The lunar section includes major events like Seollal (Lunar New Year) and Daeboreum (the first full moon), as well as seasonal terms such as Ipchun (beginning of spring) and Usu (rainwater), along with monthly customs and livelihoods. The encyclopedia can be browsed in the same way as a typical dictionary by looking up headwords, or it can be read as a cohesive work with an organic structure, like a monograph. Therefore, it is efficient for both finding specific pieces of information and studying the overall seasonal customs of Jeongwol. Starting with the Jeongwol volume, the encyclopedia was published in the following order: Spring, Autumn, Winter, Appendices, and the Index volume.

20178	Land Use Terminology Dictionary	https://www.eum.go.kr/web/in/dc/dcDictList.jsp	"The Land Use Terminology Dictionary is a specialized dictionary that compiles terms related to land use regulation. It was first published by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport in 2009 in book form, and was revised in 2010 to be available through the Land Use Regulation Information Service. Since then, as the Land Use Regulation Information Service was renamed ""Tongji-eum"", the dictionary has been provided as an online resource on the website, with the option to download PDF files. Previous versions of the dictionary (2011, May 2016, December 2016, December 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024) can be accessed in the Resource Room of the Information Hall. Land Use Terminology Dictionary Disclaimer (January 2011 version) 1. To make it easier for anyone to understand the land use information provided by the Land Use Regulation Information System, the terms related to the area, district, etc., building use under the Building Act, urban planning facilities under the National Land Planning and Utilization Act, and other relevant laws were selected. 2. Each term consists of table control, terminology type, related laws, terminology description, and related terms (see 'Example of Term Preparation'). 3. The terms in the term list are arranged in alphabetical order for convenience of use, and consist of the words in table control, term descriptions, and reference terms (see 'Terms list description'). 4. In principle, the term description includes definitions of terms, background of introduction, location and decision criteria, subdivisions, and reference terms, and is prepared by referring to relevant statutes and relevant department policy data. 5. In order to easily identify the link between terms, we have prepared a regional classification table, a building purpose classification table, and an urban planning facility classification table. You can find it in the term classification table. 6. Terms are divided into legal and professional terms, and legal terms are faithfully reflected in the legal definitions, location, and decision criteria stipulated in the relevant statutes. The jargon was prepared using urban planning, architectural dictionaries, encyclopedias, and Korean dictionaries. 7. However, various statistical data presented to assist the understanding were prepared based on the time when the relevant administrative agencies investigated and published. 8. The term explanation was not limited to the specific laws, but rather summarized in various laws related to the terms. For example, in the case of roads, various laws such as the Building Act, the National Land Planning and Utilization Act, the Road Act, and the Private Investigation Act are operated differently in accordance with the purpose of legislation, and the contents prescribed by each law are mentioned together. Therefore, when using for a specific purpose, such as permission or permission, the definitions, location and decision criteria, behavioral restrictions, and permission criteria set forth in individual statutes must be checked and followed."

On the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport’s website (Land Use Regulation System), you can find facility-specific regulation manuals and easy-to-understand permit cases explained through comics. The website also offers a ""Frequently Visited Facilities"" shortcut feature, and allows users to select regions, cities, counties, or districts to directly access the contact information for regulation-related inquiries. Land Use Regulation System: This refers to the information system managed and operated by the Minister of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport to draft and provide land use regulations to be included in the land use regulation information."
2018	Marine Gazetteer	http://www.marineregions.org/gazetteer.php	Geographic Information Systems have become indispensable tools in managing and displaying marine data and information. However, a unique georeferenced standard of marine place names and areas was not available, hampering several marine geographic applications, for example the linking of these locations to databases to integrate data. The purpose of Marine Regions is therefore to create a standard, relational list of geographic names, coupled with information and maps of the geographic location of these features. This will improve access and clarity of the different geographic, marine names such as seas, sandbanks, ridges and bays and display univocally the boundaries of marine biogeographic or managerial marine areas. Marine Regions is an integration of the VLIMAR Gazetteer and the VLIZ Maritime Boundaries Geodatabase. The VLIMAR Gazetteer is a database with geographic, mainly marine names such as seas, sandbanks, seamounts, ridges, bays or even standard sampling stations used in marine research. The geographic cover of the VLIMAR gazetteer is global but initially focused on the Belgian Continental Shelf and the Scheldt Estuary and the Southern Bight of the North Sea. Gradually more regional and global geographic information was added to VLIMAR and combining this information with the Maritime Boundaries database, representing the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the world, led to the creation of marineregions.org. Marine Regions is managed by the Flanders Marine Institute. Funding for the creation of the VLIMAR gazetteer was provided initially through the EU Network of Excellence MarBEF, but also other European initiative such as EMODNet and Lifewatch provide the necessary funding for the maintenance and management of Marine Regions. With the launch of marineregions.org, we are also aiming at the establishment of an international editorial board, responsible for the content, quality control and promotion of Marine Regions.

If you don't know exactly what this study is about, no matter how hard you study and how good you get, you won't be able to disclose information or exchange information with other researchers, so it's just self-satisfaction. Therefore, they first go through compassion to find out what their materials are, and although they are often easily published in pictures or photographs, it is most desirable to compare them with professional literature or samples already sympathetic for accurate compassion. To this end, the insect industry department of the National Institute of Agricultural Science collects samples from all over the country every year, focusing on pests that damage crops and natural enemy insects that parasitize or eat pests. As evidence of the findings, the Insect Specimens Center samples and stores the material insects used in the study, making them available to other researchers and providing information related to insect and crop pests.

20206	List of Parasite Species	http://www.parasitol.or.kr/parasitology/	"The Korean language name of the domestic parasite is summarized and included in the ""Korean Animal Collection"" published by the Korean Society for Animal Classification in 1997. It's been a long time since the Korean animal book was published, and I think there are many problems for members of our society to use it. So, we overcame the limitations of the list of animal species and decided to organize it because we needed to publish a systematic ""Parasite List"" at the conference level that is convenient for our members to use."
20207	Korean Terminology of Parasites	http://www.parasitol.or.kr/parasitology/	"The Korean Society of Parasite Studies wanted to increase the effectiveness of the parasite's academic vocabulary by adding terms based on the Korean Medical Association's ""Fiveth Book of Medicine (2009)"" and examining the validity of some terms. After completing this review, the fourth album of parasitic terms is a compilation of ""Parasite Korean names"" and ""Parasite General Terms"" and added terms to this book, referring to several recently published parasites, and incorporating new terms sent by members."
20208	Korean Terminology of Parasitology	http://www.parasitol.or.kr/parasitology/	"The revision of the Korean name for parasites in 1994 began with the principle of cooperating with the Korean Society for Animal Classification's decision to publish ""Korean Animal Master's Book."" Accordingly, there have been significant revisions and supplementations to past academic glossary (Parasite Academic Terminology I, 1977). The Korean name for parasites of the progenitor subfamily and the epigenetic subfamily was widely collected according to the 1994 Korean Species of Species, but only the arthropod sentence was taken from the manuscript of the ""Korean insect masterpiece (1994). The newly designated Korean word parasite may be more desirable if it is beautiful and easy to call, but it is not always possible, especially considering the principle of keeping usefulness and grammar. Previously used Korean parasites tried to strictly protect the permanence of the language by recognizing it as it was without any special errors. There were many exceptions despite the fact that various principles, both large and small, were established and the work was carried out, and this is the characteristic of the term. As set forth this time, I hope that we will continue to observe what problems are there and share opinions to create more desirable Korean names and use each other in the future. And the parasite scientist who picked up the new parasite hopes that the parasite's Korean name will be carefully named and proposed so that the proposal will be respected."

(...) Until now, there has been no digital gazetteer and authority list for placenames in early modern London. Our gazetteer offers a standard for placenames ca. 1550-1650.1 Such a standard enables interoperability across digital projects that include early modern London placenames. Shakeosphere and DEEP have already used our gazetteer to identify toponyms in their data and link to MoEML. We hope that other scholars, editors, and researchers will adopt these authority names in secondary criticism, in modernized editions of early texts, and in datasets that include a geographic component. The gazetteer also allows us to aggregate many variant names that have been given to a place. We define place as a space that has been made meaningful by human activity or observation. The existence of a toponym is one sign that space has become place. Furthermore, toponyms often preserve a memory of why a place is significant. Thus, toponyms are intrinsically interesting to scholars of language, history, and onomastics (the study of the origin of proper names).

In response, the Korean Intellectual Property Office revised the ""English-Korean Dictionary of Intellectual Property Rights"" published in 2008 to help the public understand difficult intellectual property terms and to reflect the changed intellectual property environment at home and abroad. In this revised edition, the description of the term was revised to make it easier to understand, and new terms and precedents of intellectual property rights that have emerged in Korea and abroad have been included. In addition, we have added new Chinese terms for companies that are active or are planning to enter the Chinese market, which has become more economically important.

20267	Medical Terminology:English-Korean, Korean-English (Korean Medical Association)	http://term.kma.org/index.asp	The Medical Terminating Committee was born in 1976 and was formed to communicate and share information between the public and medical personnel, and has been working hard to standardize and maintain medical terminology and develop and disseminate Korean medical terms. The pace of advancement in medicine is remarkable, and new technologies are being introduced and new diagnostic names and treatments are being introduced. As your enthusiasm and efforts to make good medical terms are concentrated, it seems that you have been negligent in introducing and deciding the terms needed for new medical technology. In the future, the Medical Terminology Committee will work harder to gather opinions from each conference and to introduce and standardize new medical terms for modern medicine. To spread medical terminology, the Medical Terminating Commission has been running its website since 2001, providing infrastructure to search for the latest terminology in real time and access relevant information. In September 2015, the 5th album of medical terms of the Medical Association of Physicians was published as standard terms, and we hope that this homepage will help you search for and utilize standard medical terms.

Afterwards, the final 300 power terms were selected through heated meetings, including professors and ordinary people, the National Institute of Korean Language, and various associations related to the power industry. Through this work, difficult Chinese characters and abbreviations were improved to easy terms, awkward foreign words were changed according to the notation, and the appropriate representative terms were unified when mixed. In the wake of the purification of power terms, KEPCO will minimize the use of unnecessary foreign words and continue to improve them by identifying unidentified terms, Japanese expressions, Konglish, and authoritative terms. We will make efforts to purify unfamiliar and difficult words so that people can easily understand them and communicate them at the eyes of the people.

The snag faced by the researchers in the current time is the failure of getting relevant results when searching for algorithms in any search engine. AMV is represented as a semantic model and produced OWL file, which can be directly used by anyone interested to create and publish algorithm metadata as a knowledge graph, or to provide metadata service through SPARQL endpoint. The vocabulary may also be used to annotate the literature (e.g., research article, monographs, dissertation, technical reports) providing the algorithms.

2034	Textile Museum Thesaurus	https://museum.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs3226/f/Textile%20Museum%20Thesaurus%20%28Final%29.pdf	The Textile Museum Thesaurus is a data management tool for cataloging and searching for textiles in The Textile Museum’s collection in its electronic database. The Thesaurus functions both as a controlled vocabulary for cataloging our collections and as an electronic querying aid structured to permit the highest level of success in retrieving the appropriate objects during searches. (...) The Textile Museum developed this Thesaurus because no currently available vocabulary resource meets our need to deal with textiles globally, or develops textile terminology to the level of detail necessary for textile specialists. The Textile Museum Thesaurus is, of course, idiosyncratic to its collection, software, data standards, and current curatorial staff preferences. This publication is intended to provide a model of an electronic thesaurus for cataloging textiles to the museum and textile fields. We expect that other institutions will adapt, expand, and/or draw from our Thesaurus as appropriate to their collections and needs.

2035	STRUNA	http://struna.ihjj.hr/	STRUNA is a database of Croatian Special Field Terminology. It was officially inaugurated on the web in February 2012. Its aim is to gradually make available to the public the standardized Croatian terminology for all professional domains. The Development of Croatian Special Field Terminology project started in 2007 as part of the initial coordination project launched at the initiative of the Croatian Standard Language Council, and has since been financed by the Croatian Science Foundation. The program supports the strategic values of the Foundation and fits into two basic areas of the National Strategy for Science Development – development of information technology and sociocultural transition from an industrial to a knowledge-based society. The Institute of Croatian Language and Linguistics was chosen to serve as the national coordinator. Given the pivotal role terminology plays in language development as well as professional communication, the objective of the program in a broader sense is to lay the foundation for the development of national terminology policy, to establish various forms of more structured education in this field, and to intensify long-term cooperation with national and international academic and other institutions dealing with different aspects of terminology work, with the Croatian Standards Institute and with other interested parties. (...) Experts from eighteen domains have so far joined the program with the aim of standardazing the terminology of their respective disciplines. Currently available for search are the terminologies of the following domains: aviation and air traffic, cartography and geoinformatics, chemistry, civil engineering, corrosion, dental medicine, marine engineering, mechanical engineering, polymers, and physics. Maritime terminology, anthropological terminology, and EU law terminology are in the final stage and the domains of phytomedicine, mathematics and archaeology in the process of joining the program.

2036	National Terminology Database for Irish	http://www.tearma.ie/	The database contains over 338,000 terms, searchable under both Irish and English versions. More than 2.3 million unique visitors used the website between 2006 and mid 2014. They made 9.8 million visits and 56 million searches in that time. According to annual user surveys carried out by Fiontar since 2010, the site is primarily used by translators and interpreters and by university students. (...). The first phase of the work was done with funding from INTERREG III A (2004-7). Phase I of the work consisted of digitising and integrating existing paper and electronic lists. Fiontar continues to manage and develop this resource with project funding from Foras na Gaeilge. Many resources have been added under subsequent phases, including collections of sports, arts and legal terms, tools for translation memories and other resources for translators, and a link facility to The New Corpus for Ireland. Phase V of the project began on 1 June 2014 and, among other things, a collection of computing terms is being developed. Hosting of the National Terminology Database for Irish was transferred from DCU to Tibus in May 2014. Fiontar is responsible for the application, but Tibus is now responsible for the site-hosting (availability, speed, etc). The web address for the National Terminology Database for Irish changed from focal.ie to tearma.ie on 1 March 2015.

2038	EuroTermBank	http://www.eurotermbank.com/	Consistent, harmonised and easily accessible terminology is an extremely important stronghold for ensuring true multilingualism in the European Union and throughout the world. From EU legislation and trade to the needs and mobility of every EU citizen, terminology is the key for easy, fast and reliable communications. However, new EU member countries face the issue of terminology resource fragmentation across different institutions, inconsistency and lack of coordination in terminology development, as well as structural and technical incompatibility. The EuroTermBank project results in a centralized online terminology bank for languages of new EU member countries interlinked to other terminology banks and resources. Although EuroTermBank is addressed directly towards Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, the project is open to other new EU member states and interested countries and organizations outside EU. It also enables exchange of terminology data with existing national and EU terminology databases by establishing cooperative relationships, aligning methodologies and standards, designing and implementing data exchange mechanisms and procedures.

2039	Sweden´s national term bank	http://www.rikstermbanken.se/	At its grand opening, Rikstermbanken contained more than 50 000 term records, and it will continue to grow contentwise. Although it is a Swedish term bank, it does not only contain Swedish terms but also terms in other languages, e.g. English, French, German, and Finnish, to name a few. Terminologicentrum TNC (The Swedish Centre for Terminology) has designed the term bank and its software, and is also the responsible body for the term bank and its content. The Swedish Ministry of Industry, Employment and Communications has contributed financially to its realization. More than 70 organizations – mostly public bodies but also associations and private companies – have contributed as suppliers of terminology collections. The terminology in Rikstermbanken belongs to various domains – geology, economics, planning and construction, cleaning, and interior decoration. Most of TNC’s own glossaries are also included. Thus, Rikstermbanken hopefully represents the accurate and actual terminology usage of these various domains.

20391	The European Science Vocabulary	https://op.europa.eu/web/eu-vocabularies/concept-scheme/-/resource?uri=http://data.europa.eu/8mn/euroscivoc/40c0f173-baa3-48a3-9fe6-d6e8fb366a00	EuroSciVoc is a multilingual taxonomy that represents all the main fields of science that were discovered from CORDIS content and organised through a semi-automatic process based on NLP techniques. It contains more than 1000 categories in 6 languages (English, French, German, Italian, Polish and Spanish) and each category is enriched with relevant keywords extracted from the textual description of CORDIS projects. EuroSciVoc is managed by the Publications Office of the EU, and is currently used by the CORDIS website. It is specifically developed as a reference vocabulary for the Open Science community and is aligned with Linked Open Data standards.
20392	EUropean Research Information Ontology	https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/dataset/-/resource?uri=http://publications.europa.eu/resource/dataset/eurio&version=1.0	EURIO (EUropean Research Information Ontology) conceptualises, formally encodes and makes available in an open, structured and machine-readable format data about resarch projects funded by the EU's framework programmes for research and innovation.
20393	BLL-Thesaurus	https://data.linguistik.de/bll/index.html	The Bibliography of Linguistic Literature (BLL) is one of the most comprehensive linguistic bibliographies worldwide. It covers general linguistics with all its neighbouring disciplines and subdomains as well as English, German and Romance linguistics. The BLL dates back as far as 1971 and lists circa 500,000 bibliographic references. Furthermore, the BLL provides a hierarchically categorised thesaurus of domain-specific index terms in German and English. The BLL Thesaurus comprises more than 9,000 subject terms.
20394	European Science Vocabulary	https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/dataset/-/resource?uri=http://publications.europa.eu/resource/dataset/euroscivoc	European Science Vocabulary (EuroSciVoc) is the taxonomy of fields of science based on OECD's 2015 Frascati Manual taxonomy. It was extended with fields of science categories extracted from CORDIS content through a semi-automatic process developed with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
20395		https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/dataset/-/resource?uri=http://publications.europa.eu/resource/dataset/eurio	EURIO (EUropean Research Information Ontology) conceptualises, formally encodes and makes available in an open, structured and machine-readable format data about resarch projects funded by the EU's framework programmes for research and innovation.
20396	Mathematics Subject Classification System	https://msc2020.org/	Mathematical Reviews (MR) and zbMATH collaborate on maintaining the Mathematics Subject Classification, which is used by these reviewing services, publishers, funding agencies, and others to categorize items in the mathematical sciences literature. It is a taxonomy created by and for mathematical researchers. Every ten years, the two editorial groups solicit input from the mathematics community. For the current revision, we received over 350 comments and suggestions from more than 100 different people. MR and zbMATH carefully considered this input from the community, and used it in the preparation of our joint revision of the classification.
20397	Classification of the classified book catalogue of the Göttingen State and University Library	https://www.univerlag.uni-goettingen.de/handle/3/GBS3?locale-attribute=en	This classification scheme was used to classifie the collection of the Göttingen State and University Library till 1945. It has its origin in the 18th century.
204	Database for scientific papers in nursing Thesaurus	http://www.dip.de/datenbank-wise/informationen-zu-wise/thesaurus/	The thesaurus used for the database CINAHL is probably the most advanced in the field of nursing sciences, but it is not a comprehensive thesaurus in English. The Thesaurus developed for the database WISE is based on a keyword collection, which was built between 2001 and 2009. The terms in this collection were not systematized, and as part of the development of the database, the intention was to begin with a systematization of these terms, which is divided into two levels. On the lower level, subjects differentiate these topics. Keywords can be assigned to several categories. The search in the database WISE can thus be concentrated on specific topics, since the assignment of individual keywords becomes clear.
2040	Melvil Decimal System	http://blog.librarything.com/main/2010/08/introducing-the-melvil-decimal-system/	The Melvil Decimal System (MDS) is based on the 1922 public domain edition of Dewey Decimal System with class labels adjusted to modern language.

20404	Retrospective classification of medical, scientific, legal and theological prints	http://dev.hab.de/signaturen/public/skos.php?notation=MN	In the 1980s, the Duke August Library made an attempt to retrospectively classify its old holdings. This was based on the system designed by Otto Hartwig (1830-1902) for the library of the University of Halle, but adapted to the Wolfenbüttel collection profile. The classification was carried out for medicine and natural sciences, partly also for theology and law. A card catalogue was created, which was converted into electronic form in the course of the catalogue enrichment.
20405	21 Books of Universal Knowledge or Universal Partitioning		In the mid-16th century, the learned physician Conrad Gessner (1516-1565) published his „Bibliotheca Universalis“, a comprehensive bibliography that claimed to list all books printed in Latin, Greek and Hebrew in alphabetical order. In a second part, the „Pandectae“, published from 1548 onwards, he also developed a universal system of knowledge. He compiled numerous loci communes for all 21 main groups and grouped them into superordinate tituli. No tituli and loci communes are available for the field of medicine, as this was not published due to economic reasons. The 21 main groups were used by several early modern libraries to organise their collections.
20406	Theses or loci communes of the whole medical field		In 1532, a student of the learned physician and theologian Otto Brunfels (1488-1534) published an extensive and widely recognised loci communes collection on the field of medicine, which he had compiled on the basis of Brunfels' lessons. The most important statements, especially those of the traditional authorities, are compiled in 106 chapters. The small-scale structure allows precise access to special contemporary medical topics.
20407	Catalogue of the Thuana Library		The catalogue of the Bibliotheca Thuana was first published in 1679 in two parts. It is based on the influential classification system of the Paris libraries and is designed to be universal in accordance with Jacques Auguste de Thou‘s book collection. Contemporarily, the catalogue was widely recognised, especially because of its strong subdivision. In the detail of its classification, it anticipates the professionalised, deep classifications of the 19th century.

2041		http://www.ifrs.org/XBRL/IFRS-Taxonomy/Pages/IFRS-Taxonomy.aspx	The IFRS Taxonomy™ is the global standard issued by the IFRS Foundation to mark up electronic IFRS financial statements. By providing the IFRS Taxonomy, the IASB can ensure that the taxonomy used is an accurate representation of the International Financial Reporting Standards ('the Standards'). A taxonomy is a classification system of some kind of knowledge or business domain. The content of the IFRS Taxonomy is designed to accurately reflect the presentation and disclosure requirements of the Standards as issued by the IASB. Its content also includes elements from the accompanying materials to the Standards (Implementation Guidance and Illustrative Examples) and elements for disclosures that are not required, but that are commonly reported in practice by entities (Common Practice). The IFRS Taxonomy Updates occur throughout the year in line with the publication of new or amended Standards issued by the IASB. Updates may also be released as a result of common practice projects or technology updates. Each year an annual compilation of all Updates is produced (the Annual IFRS Taxonomy). The IFRS Taxonomy is developed through a formal system of due process. This ensures transparency and compliance with best practice, and also provides quality assurance and opportunities to engage with stakeholders.
20410	NFDI4Culture Ontology	https://nfdi4culture.de/ontology	The NFDICO core ontology describes all resouces (datasets, data providers, persons, projects and other entities) in the data domain of NFDI4Culture (see: https://nfdi4culture.de/resource/about.html). It serves as the basis for the NFDI4Culture Knowledge Graph (see: https://nfdi4culture.de/resources/knowledge-graph.html) and contains mappings to numerous external vocabularies and ontologies.
20411	iDAI.world Thesaurus	http://thesauri.dainst.org/de.html	The iDAI.world Thesaurus brings together and harmonises all thesauri and vocabularies of the libraries and the projects of the German Archaeological Institute. It was developed between 2015 and 2019, since 2020 it is continuously updated and implemented. The core structure is based on the BBT.

The digital full-texts and the thesaurus were created within the travel!digital project (Project-Nr.: ÖAW0204, 1.12.2014-30.11.2017) at the ACDH - Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. Exclusively reflecting the vocabulary contained in the travel guides, the thesaurus uses spellings and translations from there. The primary language is German (4908 entries), followed by English (177), Arabic (81), French (52), Spanish (25) and other languages with less than 25 entries. The focus is on group designations (amongst others geographical oriented designations, ethnic/national, religious and social communities as well as professions) and selected sights.
20415	DEFC Thesaurus	https://vocabs.dariah.eu/defc_thesaurus/en/	DEFC thesaurus is a knowledge organization system designed for Digitizing Early Farming Cultures project.
20416	Iron-Age-Danube thesaurus	https://vocabs.dariah.eu/iad_thesaurus/en/	The Iron-Age-Danube thesaurus is based on controlled vocabulary of Iron-Age-Danube database created in the frame of the Interreg Iron-Age-Danube project (www.iron-age-danube.eu). The purpose of the database is to gain an overview of archaeology of Iron Age sites, their touristic potential, and cultural protection status. The database is limited to the sites located in the Danube region including Austria, Hungary, Croatia, and Slovenia. To avoid misconceptions and ambiguities resulting from the use of different translations for the same concept throughout the literature, the Iron-Age-Danube thesaurus offers a unified terminology and translations of its concepts to German, Hungarian, Croatian, and Slovenian language. In addition, a special attention was given to the possibility of linked data and reuse of existing standards, therefore many concepts in Iron-Age-Danube thesaurus are linked to existing vocabularies of Forum on Information Standards in Heritage (FISH) and Ontology Lookup Service (OLS).

20419	Glossary of metadata standards	http://jennriley.com/metadatamap/seeingstandards_glossary_pamphlet.pdf	The sheer number of metadata standards in the cultural heritage sector is overwhelming, and their inter-relationships further complicate the situation. This visual map of the metadata landscape is intended to assist planners with the selection and implementation of metadata standards. Each of the 105 standards listed here is evaluated on its strength of application to defined categories in each of four axes: community, domain, function, and purpose. The strength of a standard in a given category is determined by a mixture of its adoption in that category, its design intent, and its overall appropriateness for use in that category. The standards represented here are among those most heavily used or publicized in the cultural heritage community, though certainly not all standards that might be relevant are included. A small set of the metadata standards plotted on the main visualization also appear as highlights above the graphic. These represent the most commonly known or discussed standards for cultural heritage metadata.

This vocabulary comes from the scientific geological literature in Spanish and obviously does not cover all aspects of geology, which entails important limitations when it comes to prioritising terms and presenting a complete and uniform thesaurus. The purpose of this Thesaurus is to structure the terminology used in the discipline of geology to be used in the ICYT Database as a vocabulary control tool, the dissemination and use of which will help to carry out bibliographic searches and improve the indexing of documents. It is presented in three languages: English, French and Spanish."

The text is a concise summary of all the structures encountered during routine endoscopic surgery in the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses and at the interface with the orbit and skull base but does not provide a comprehensive text for advanced skull base surgery. It draws on a detailed review of the literature and provides a consensus where several options are available, defining the anatomical structure in simple terms and in English. It is recognised that this is an area of great variation and some indication of the frequency with which these variants are encountered is given in the text and table. All major anatomical points are illustrated, drawing on the expertise of the multi-national and multi-disciplinary contributors to this project.

The scope and coverage of the ontology result from the practical requirements of the realization of our knowledge graph and the associated concerns. An essential particularity of our domain is that we model perspectives rather than facts. Therefore, the possibilities of the linked open data paradigm to let complementary and also contradictory statements coexist are very useful to us. This particularity has the consequence that 'reification' (i.e., statements about statements) is an important modeling dimension that includes, among other things, the unambiguous referencing of each statement, including linkage to the dataset to which it can be traced.

20475	Open Funder Registry	https://www.crossref.org/documentation/funder-registry/	It is good practice for authors to acknowledge support for and contributions to their research in their published articles. This support may be financial, such as a grant or salary award; or practical, such as the use or loan of specialist facilities and equipment. They do this by listing the funding agency and the grant number somewhere in their article - usually the first or last page, or in the acknowledgments or footnotes section. Members contribute by depositing the funding acknowledgements from their publications as part of their standard metadata, together with the unique funder IDs listed in the OFR. The deposit should include funder names, funder IDs, and associated grant numbers. This means that anyone can make connections, for example, to identify which funders invest in certain fields of research. Funding data is also used by funders to track the publications that result from their grants.

20477	INDIGO Graffiti Thesaurus	https://projectindigo.eu/	The INDIGO Graffiti Thesaurus is a curated academic resource centred on contemporary graffiti terminology, with a spatial focus on the Danube Canal in Vienna, Austria. It is not just a compilation of terms, but also a specialised tool that organises and categorises graffiti-related concepts within a controlled vocabulary. More specifically, it takes the form of a thesaurus, where concepts are connected to each other through equivalence, hierarchical, and associative relationships. By leveraging the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) data model, the thesaurus ensures consistency and precision in its representation of information. The use of SKOS not only makes the thesaurus accessible but also interoperable, allowing for seamless integration with other widely used resources such as Wikidata and the Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) of the J. Paul Getty Trust and Getty Research Institute. The thesaurus is inspired by the AAT and therefore also contains information provided under the ODC Attribution License by the Getty Research Institute. Moreover, the content systematically reflects the structure of the AAT by using facets, hierarchy names, and guide terms. The thesaurus is made available through the Vocabs service of the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage (ACDH-CH), which utilises Skosmos, an open-source software tailored for publishing vocabularies. For enhanced accessibility, the thesaurus can be queried via a REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface), facilitating its interaction with data over the World Wide Web. Moreover, its availability in diverse data formats, including TSV (Tab-Separated Values) and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), caters to a wide range of academic and technological preferences. With its unique focus on the graffiti culture of the Danube Canal, the thesaurus offers a deep insight into Vienna's Danube Canal contemporary graffiti world and serves as a valuable tool for all those interested in this form of creativity.

2050	Pokémon Category	http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_category	In a Pokémon's Pokédex information, the category (...) (Japanese: 分類 classification) is a name which identifies the Pokémon based on one of its defining biological characteristics. Most often, the defining traits are part of the Pokémon’s physiology, special abilities, or behavior. It was previously also known as species. (...) Because of how brief and uninformative the description of a Pokémon often is in its category, and how little the category relates to other data, it is not often regarded as an important piece of information about a Pokémon. Before Generation III, the category was shown by just seeing the Pokémon, rather than upon catching it. In Pokémon games prior to Generation III, the character limit for a category name was ten characters. This has since increased from Generation III onwards, with the longest English category name being observed to be thirteen characters long. In other languages, the longest category name is Pachirisu's German category 'Elektrohörnchen' which is 15 characters long. This includes spaces but does not include 'Pokémon'.

Technology information such as R&D and production and management information such as personnel, general affairs, accounting, purchase and sales are representative of the information held by companies. Such information can be protected as trade secrets only when it meets economic usefulness, non-publicity, and confidentiality. In particular, the court makes it a major criterion for reviewing whether general information and trade secrets are separately managed when determining whether confidential management is satisfied in the event of a trade secret leakage accident. However, companies have complained of difficulties in classifying and rating their information because there has been no adequate standard for systematic secret grade classification so far. Accordingly, it is intended to support companies to efficiently establish trade secret management strategies by presenting the criteria for selecting appropriate protection measures (patents, trade secrets, etc.) for information held by companies, and by presenting a method of calculating the grade of information managed as trade secrets and an appropriate level of management for each grade. This guide was derived through the research ⌋ (Korea Intellectual Property Office, 2016) to establish a classification system for ⌈ trade secret data, and can be modified and utilized to suit the reality of each company.

20606	Choi's Thesaurus	http://www.ontorus.net/page/default.aspx	Korean Thesaurus: The relationship between the description of terms and terms (Choi's Thesaurus) is a control vocabulary for Korean words that structures the relationship between the semantic information of terms and related terms. Most algorithms for processing unstructured data have already been developed and known, but structured data are required to process them more precisely. To this end, terms have been collected since 1993 under the goal of constructing metadata for Korean terms that have a relationship between semantic information and terms, and they have been described as standard thesaurus structure. Thesaurus is widely known as a form of structuring terms and concisely abstracts complex relationships between terms. In this dictionary, the standard thesaurus structure is basically adopted and additionally expanded. The subject of the registered terms includes nouns such as subject name, life, institution/organization name, place name, animal name, plant name, legal name, literature name, monument name, product name, meeting/assembly name, event name, etc., and verbs and adjectives. As of August 2013, 1.3 million terms (800,000 terms in Korean, 510,000 terms in foreign language. See statistical functions for more information) were registered and terminology relationships were defined. Although it is not yet sufficient, it is thought that we have constructed a sufficient amount of data to process unstructured data in the field to some extent, so we will disclose the results so far. More than 10,000 terms of new terms are added every month, and this work will continue along with the revision work.

226	Classification of the Purposes of Non-Profit Institutions Serving Households	http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?Cl=6&%3BLg=1	In principle, COPNI classifies individual outlays of NPISHs according to the purpose they serve. In most countries, however, there is little information about the activities of NPISHs and so, for practical reasons, the NPISHs themselves will usually constitute the units of classification. Many, perhaps most, NPISHs have a single purpose and can be unambiguously allocated to one of the purposes listed in the classification. Even if a broadly defined NPISH performs two or more functions - such as a religious organization running hospitals and schools as well as organizing religious ceremonies - it will usually be possible to distinguish separate units for each function. If it is not possible to identify a separate unit for each function, or to have an estimation related to each one, then the NPISH as a whole will have to be assigned to the purpose that predominates in terms of employment or total expenditure.

In 2000, thanks to the collaboration of the National Foundation for Educational Research in England and Wales (NFER), work began on updating the Thesaurus, taking into account the terminology of the IBE’s new framework programme and the report to UNESCO of the International Commission on Education for the Twenty- First Century, Learning: the treasure within, also known as the Delors report. Many new descriptors were introduced, while changes were made to the terms dealing with teaching and learning methods, and to the educational technology terms. Some descriptors and identifiers were eliminated. At the same time the number of explanatory notes was increased. In 2002, further developments took place with the introduction of new descriptors relating to curriculum and to HIV/AIDS education, in line with the IBE’s new activities. This latest October 2007 revision includes the addition of over 130 new terms, presented in the same format as the 2002 revision, and also available on the Internet in English only. The IBE is indebted to colleagues in the UNESCO Institute of Lifelong Learning, Hamburg, the UNESCO Regional Office for Education in Latin America and the Caribbean, Santiago, and the Caribbean Educational Research Information Service (CERIS), University of the West Indies who collaborated with suggestions for new terms and modifications. The UNESCO-IBE Education Thesaurus is an important indexing tool in the education field.

The Thesaurus facilitates post-coordinated indexing, whereby complex subjects are represented by several different headings, rather than one single heading. Post-coordinated systems rely on the use of boolean operators - such as and, or, not - to combine the separate headings for searching. In constructing terms, punctuation is used minimally and hyphens avoided where possible. For phrases, direct order or natural language is preferred. To distinguish meaning in homographs, a qualifying term appears in brackets-for example: Dependency (Economics), Dependency (Personality), Dependency (Physical).
236	Standard International Trade Classification		The scope of SITC, Revision 4, remains the same as that of SITC, Revision 3, that is to say SITC, Revision 4, covers all goods classifiable in HS except for monetary gold, gold coin and current coin. All SITC, Revision 4, basic headings (except for 911.0 and 931.0) are defined in terms of HS07 subheadings. Since SITC is now recommended only for analytical purposes, there was no need - except in several special cases - to create new basic headings in SITC, Revision 4, that would be in one-to-one correspondence with the new HS07 subheadings. SITC, Revision 4, retains the overall structure of SITC, Revision 3, and consists of the same number of sections, divisions and groups. The changes made were at the level of basic headings and some subgroups. SITC, Revision 4, contains 2,970 basic headings.

239	International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities	http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/isic-4.asp	The International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) is the international reference classification of productive activities. Its main purpose is to provide a set of activity categories that can be utilized for the collection and reporting of statistics according to such activities. Since the adoption of the original version of ISIC in 1948, the majority of countries around the world have used ISIC as their national activity classification or have developed national classifications derived from ISIC. ISIC has therefore provided guidance to countries in developing national activity classifications and has become an important tool for comparing statistical data on economic activities at the international level. Wide use has been made of ISIC, both nationally and internationally, in classifying data according to kind of economic activity in the fields of economic and social statistics, such as for statistics on national accounts, demography of enterprises, employment and others. In addition, ISIC is increasingly used for non-statistical purposes.

242	Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research Thesaurus	https://www.vocabularyserver.com/icpsr/index.php	"The ICPSR Thesaurus is a controlled vocabulary system composed of three separate lists: Subject Thesaurus, Personal Names Authority List, and Geographic Names Thesaurus. Subject Thesaurus is an alphabetical listing of social science subject terms. The scope of this thesaurus is multidisciplinary and is intended to reflect the subject range of the ICPSR archive. Social science disciplines represented include: political science, sociology, history, economics, education, criminal justice, gerontology, demography, public health, law, and international relations. Personal Names Authority List provides controlled name forms and spellings. Unlike the Subject and the Geographic lists, it is non-hierarchical (there are no broader/narrower, or related term designations). This list is designed to provide name form consistency and, through the use of a ""description"" (DSC) note field, enable users to distinguish between same or similar names and to determine whether the person/name is appropriate to their indexing or searching needs. Geographic Names Thesaurus provides guidance on the preferred and/or current names of geographic and geopolitical entities. It is hierarchically arranged using broader/narrower notation, allowing one to navigate the relationships among region, continent, country, and in some cases, cities. Scope notes briefly detailing the history of country name changes are included along with instructions and restrictions for their use and application. Organization Names Authority List is an alphabetical authority list of name forms for organizations listed in ICPSR metadata as funding agencies or as corporate authors/principal investigators."
243	International Labour Organization Thesaurus	http://ilo.multites.net/	The ILO Thesaurus is a compilation of more than 4000 terms relating to the world of work. The ILO Thesaurus contains terms on a wide variety of topics related to economic and social development. Areas of major interest to the ILO are treated in detail. These include labour and employment policy, labour standards, labour administration, labour relations, vocational training, social protection, working conditions, wages, occupational safety and health, small enterprise, the informal economy and human rights in the workplace. The ILO Thesaurus is used primarily for the content analysis of material selected for inclusion in Labordoc. Familiarity with the ILO Thesaurus makes it easier to find material in Labordoc on a specific subject. The ILO Thesaurus is also used by other departments in the ILO for indexing and retrieving their own specific or local material. Staff of the International Labour Standards Department use it to summarize the contents of major labour legislation included in their database NATLEX. A number of specialized libraries in ILO partner institutions - governments, employers' organizations, trade unions - use the ILO Thesaurus as a tool for indexing and retrieval. As well, several ILO field offices use the facet numbers in the ILO Thesaurus to arrange their collections. Editors and translators also use the ILO Thesaurus as a specialized glossary.
244		http://www.ilo.org/public/english/support/lib/tools/taxonomy.htm	The ILO Taxonomy was designed by the ILO Library as a tool for retrieving information from the ILO website. Its structure therefore closely reflects the work programme of the ILO and is used by ILO departments and Field Offices for describing the content of their web pages and for searching the ILO web site. It is also well suited for use as a subject classification system for arranging collections in small libraries or labour information centres. The main difference between the ILO Taxonomy and the ILO Thesaurus is its purpose. As mentioned above, the Taxonomy was designed to facilitate information retrieval from the ILO website. The Thesaurus, on the other hand, is designed to cover a much greater range of subjects and is not specific to the work of the ILO. The ILO Taxonomy is more flexible in use than the ILO Thesaurus; if necessary, the user can add, modify or remove terms. Because of its simple structure, the Taxonomy can be easily tailored to local environments. As with the ILO Thesaurus, the ILO Taxonomy can be used as a subject classification system for collection arrangement in small libraries or labour information centres. The ILO Taxonomy comprises 400 labour-related terms arranged into 25 subject groups.

250	International Thesaurus of Refugee Terminology	http://www.refugeethesaurus.org/	The Thesaurus grew out of the Draft Thesaurus of Refugee Terminology compiled in English for the UNHCR by Piers Campbell in 1986. In 1988, the then chief of the UNHCR Centre for Documentation on Refugees (CDR), Hans Thoolen, invited Jean Aitchison, a respected expert in the field of thesauri, to provide the technical expertise for the revision and restructuring of this draft. She worked closely with the CDR and with an international working group, and the result of their collaboration was the first edition of the International Thesaurus of Refugee Terminology, in three separate language editions, published in 1989. The Spanish version was translated by the Latin American Information Center on Migration (CIMAL) in Santiago de Chile and published by the Instituto Interamericano de Derechos Humanos (IIDH) in Costa Rica. The French edition was translated by Documentation Réfugiés in Paris and published by La Documentation française (France). The English edition was published by UNHCR. We hope this new version will serve as a more efficient medium for identifying relevant indexing terminology and as a value-added mechanism for managing refugee- and forced migration-related information. It is intended as a tool for use by organizations that process information concerning refugees.

252	Code of Federal Regulations		The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) annual edition is the codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the departments and agencies of the Federal Government. It is divided into 50 titles that represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. The 50 subject matter titles contain one or more individual volumes, which are updated once each calendar year, on a staggered basis. The annual update cycle is as follows: titles 1-16 are revised as of January 1; titles 17-27 are revised as of April 1; titles 28-41 are revised as of July 1; and titles 42-50 are revised as of October 1. Each title is divided into chapters, which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts that cover specific regulatory areas. Large parts may be subdivided into subparts. All parts are organized in sections, and most citations to the CFR refer to material at the section level. The Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (e-CFR) is a regularly updated, unofficial editorial compilation of CFR material and Federal Register amendments produced by the National Archives and Records Administration's Office of the Federal Register (OFR) and the Government Printing Office.
253	Product Classification	http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPCD/classification.cfm	The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has established classifications for approximately 1,700 different generic types of devices and grouped them into 16 medical specialties referred to as panels. Each of these generic types of devices is assigned to one of three regulatory classes based on the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of the device.
254	Gross Motor Function Classification System	https://canchild.ca/en/resources/42-gross-motor-function-classification-system-expanded-revised-gmfcs-e-r	The Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) is a 5 level classification system that describes the gross motor function of children and youth with cerebral palsy on the basis of their self-initiated movement with particular emphasis on sitting, walking, and wheeled mobility. Distinctions between levels are based on functional abilities, the need for assistive technology, including hand-held mobility devices (walkers, crutches, or canes) or wheeled mobility, and to a much lesser extent, quality of movement. The focus of the GMFCS is on determining which level best represents the child's or youth's present abilities and limitations in gross motor function. Emphasis is on usual performance in home, school, and community settings (i.e., what they do), rather than what they are known to be able to do at their best (capability). It is therefore important to classify current performance in gross motor function and not to include judgments about the quality of movement or prognosis for improvement. The GMFCS - E&R includes an age band for youth 12 to 18 years of age and emphasizes the concepts inherent in the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). We encourage users to be aware of the impact that environmental and personal factors may have on what children and youth are observed or reported to do. The descriptions for the 6 to 12 year and 12 to 18 year age bands reflect the potential impact of environment factors (e.g., distances in school and community) and personal factors (e.g., energy demands and social preferences) on methods of mobility.

26	Los Angeles Comprehensive Bibliographic Database Thesaurus		The LACBD Thesaurus was compiled from the subject indexes that accompany the two bibliographies to provide a controlled vocabulary that spans one hundred years of Los Angeles subject matter. This specificity means that some terms and names one might expect in a thesaurus about Los Angeles will not be present. Likewise, general subject hierarchies that may have been constructed to place orphan terms were not developed, although the current structure allows for future development. Part one of the LACBD thesaurus is a common subject thesaurus. Index subject headings from the bibliographies were compiled into a hierarchical thesaurus. Some terms were created or added from other vocabularies to collocate legacy index terms. Part two is the LACBD Geographic Names Thesaurus. Buildings, streets, institutions and neighborhoods are among the many kinds of geographic names included. Only places that are named in the source bibliographies have been included in the thesaurus, although contemporary names may have been added to provide access for today’s users. Facet nodes based upon the LACBD Subject thesaurus group the geographic names into helpful categories. Part three is the LACBD Personal Names Authority List. Peoples’ names that are indexed in the bibliographies are included in this list. As with the geographic names, facet nodes based upon the LACBD Subject thesaurus group the personal names into categories. There are some persons who elude categorization, and they are grouped under an 'unclassified names' heading. Developed as a companion resource for the Los Angeles Comprehensive Bibliographic Database (LACBD).

A total of some 240 descriptors have been deleted in order to give the thesaurus a more specific subject focus. Some 56 existing descriptors have been clarified by the addition of Scope Notes (SN) in some or all of the languages concerned. Many of the terms in all three languages have also been changed in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the POPIN Thesaurus Management Working Group, primarily to achieve closer comparability between the POPIN Thesaurus and the Macrothesaurus. A few changes in facet titles have also been made, but no major changes to the thematic organisation of the thesaurus were attempted. The POPIN Thesaurus is designed primarily for individual organisations and networks wishing to index material acquired by libraries and documentation centres and for the corresponding retrieval of such material. Second, the thesaurus may be used as a terminological guide for the standardisation of index entries such as subject headings.

298	International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground	http://www.cryosphericsciences.org/snowClassification.html	Since 1990 our collective knowledge of snow and the techniques we use to observe its characteristics have evolved. Thus, in 2003, the current classification (Colbeck et al., 1990) needed an update, but the users of the 1990 classification felt that corrections and additions should be kept to a minimum. Following the spirit of the previous editions, the Working Group on Snow Classification took care to again provide a concise document usable by user groups of quite different specialties: snow scientists, practitioners, scientists from other fields, as well as interested lay persons. However, classification schemes typically become more technical as knowledge, measurement techniques, and observation methods evolve. The classification deals primarily with seasonal snow, even though many concepts in the present snow classification can also be applied to firn, which is the first stage in the formation of glacier ice. Definitions and tools are provided mainly to describe point observations of the snowpack, e.g., from snow pit work. However, the classification does not attempt to classify snow covers from a climatic point of view.

In 2005, Library and Archives Canada assumed responsibility for the CST and the DSP thesaurus has been maintained and developed independently since then. The PDS thesaurus is a bilingual vocabulary consisting of two separate data files, English and French. The English and French versions of the thesaurus were developed and are maintained simultaneously and neither language is to be considered the dominant or source language in this vocabulary. Neither language is a translation of the other; they are each in a relationship of equivalence. The English thesaurus and the French thesaurus are identical in their coverage but their respective relational structures are not identical due to the natural conceptual and terminological differences between the two languages. The English vocabulary contains 2157 postable terms and 1698 non-postable terms. All postable terms are assigned to one or more of nineteen subject catagories. Used as a source of subject descriptors for DSP catalogue records. As of 2009, the PDS Subject Thesaurus is also being used by Publishing and Depository Services as a source of descriptors for web metadata on the Publications Canada web site.

306	Australian Occupational Health and Safety Thesaurus		The scope of AOHST is to cover concepts relevant to OHS in Australia at national, State and local level. Some concepts are international, but the emphasis is given to the Australian context wherever necessary. The aim is to limit the size of the thesaurus to no more than 3,000 terms. This is to ensure that it is relatively easy to review and keep up-to-date. The terminology currently included in AOHST is OHS specific. This means that certain areas which are peripheral to the NOHSC’s priorities, such as compensation and insurance, are less developed at this stage. However, the thesaurus is structured in such a way as to allow the inclusion or exclusion of other categories, as required. The AOHST is of particular importance in the online environment in providing subject access to documents, databases and web sites.

It consists of descriptors and non-descriptors, accompanied by their hierarchical, associative and prescriptive relationships. The scope of the Thesaurus is dynamic and reflects subjects that have been addresssed at one time or another in Statistics Canada sources. Terms were selected from various Statistics Canada products, including publications, databases and related sources. The following types of concepts have been excluded from the Thesaurus: geographical names, titles (e.g., of surveys), proper names (e.g., of companies) and acronyms, except where they are in common usage. In the Thesaurus, French and English have equal weight, neither being the dominant or ""source"" language. The French and English versions are parallel except for non-descriptors in which correlation between the French and English versions of the Thesaurus may or may not occur. Exact equivalence is mandatory only for preferred terms (descriptors). Descriptors in French are in the masculine form; for example, ""acteurs"" is preferred, not ""actrices""; ""techniciens"" is preferred, not ""techniciennes"" or ""technicien(ne)s"". In general, terms are in the form of nouns or noun phrases. The plural form is preferred over the singular; this convention has been observed in both English and French. Terms are in direct (not inverted) format, as they would be in natural speech; for example, ""primary education"" not ""education, primary""; ""age of head of household"" not ""head of household - age"". Terms may be accompanied, as required, by scope notes which provide a brief explanation of intended coverage or proper usage of a term. The relationships contained in the Thesaurus are hierarchical (broader/narrower), associative (related) or prescriptive (use/used for)."

321	Genre/Form Terms for Law Materials	http://vocabularyserver.com/lawgenre/	From 2007 through 2009, members of the working group discussed the terms that should be included in the thesaurus and used a wiki to help organize the various phases of the project. Their starting point was William Benemann’s Genre terms for law materials: a thesaurus (Buffalo, N.Y.: William S. Hein, 2006). The working group decided to modify the style and wording of some of Benemann’s terms, remove others altogether, and add additional headings. The group also added many cross references and scope notes and reviewed the corresponding LC subject headings for possible harmonization of the two lists. In October 2009 the AALL Cataloging and Classification Committee approved the thesaurus. AALL’s thesaurus also includes approximately twenty terms that are not specific to law. Instead, they represent genres and forms of general reference works that are heavily collected by law and other libraries (e.g., academic theses, dictionaries, and directories).

33	Thesaurus of Australian Government Subjects	https://www.finance.gov.au/agimo-archive/tags.html	It contains a total of 3216 terms, comprising 1430 Preferred terms and 1786 Non-preferred terms (entry terms or reference points). The structure is hierarchical, using a 'tree' structure that starts with broad concepts (top terms) which are then broken down into narrower concepts. The structure is fairly flat, with 571 top terms, and a maximum of 3-4 steps in each hierarchy. Subject thesaurus terms are used to describe the subject matter of resources - they describe what resources are about. This thesaurus is designed for post-coordinate retrieval - that is, each term represents a single concept, and as many terms as necessary may be used to describe a resource. This provides for flexibility and precision during resource discovery, because the searcher is able to combine terms to satisfy the particular enquiry. In indexing and retrieval, composite concepts may require the use of two or more keywords. For example, a resource dealing with 'computer network security' would have the TAGS terms 'Computer networks' and 'Security measures' assigned as Subject metadata. TAGS is a thesaurus of subject terms for use by Australian Government agencies which: covers, at a high level, subject concepts representing the scope of Australian Government activities; provides a potential source of terminology for portal browse lists; and provides a subject vocabulary which is broader than the detailed vocabularies already adopted by some agencies, but which is able to function as an introduction to those detailed vocabularies, or to serve as a controlled vocabulary for those agencies without a specialised one.
330	International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks	http://www.wipo.int/classifications/nice/	The Nice Classification (NCL) is an international classification of goods and services applied for the registration of trademarks and service marks.

The Electronic Forum has been available since May 2010. It has been developed in order to facilitate the process of submission and discussion of proposals for changes to the Nice, Vienna and Locarno Classifications by the countries of the respective Unions and by certain organizations specialized in the field of trademarks or industrial designs. Access to the information posted on the electronic forum is open to the public. The Nice Classification is based on the Classification prepared by the United International Bureaux for the Protection of Intellectual Property (BIRPI) - predecessor of WIPO - in 1935. It was that Classification, consisting of a list of 34 classes and an alphabetical list of goods, that was adopted under the Nice Agreement and later expanded to embrace also eleven classes covering services and an alphabetical list of those services.
331	International Classification of the Figurative Elements of Marks	http://www.wipo.int/classifications/vienna/	The Vienna Classification constitutes a hierarchical system that proceeds from the general to the particular, classifying the figurative elements of marks into categories, divisions and sections, on the basis of their shape. This publication contains the seventh edition of the Classification, which comprises a total of: 29 categories, 145 divisions, 806 main sections, and 903 auxiliary sections. The examples of figurative elements relating to certain divisions, are included for information purposes only, and are therefore not an integral part of the Classification.
332	Common Procurement Vocabulary	http://simap.ted.europa.eu/web/simap/cpv	The CPV establishes a single classification system for public procurement aimed at standardising the references used by contracting authorities and entities to describe the subject of procurement contracts. The CPV consists of a main vocabulary for defining the subject of a contract, and a supplementary vocabulary for adding further qualitative information. The main vocabulary is based on a tree structure comprising codes of up to 9 digits (an 8 digit code plus a check digit) associated with a wording that describes the type of supplies, works or services forming the subject of the contract. The main vocabulary is based on a tree structure comprising codes of up to nine digits associated with a wording that describes the supplies, works or services forming the subject of the contract. * The first two digits identify the divisions (XX000000-Y); * The first three digits identify the groups (XXX00000-Y); * The first four digits identify the classes (XXXX0000-Y); * The first five digits identify the categories (XXXXX000-Y); Each of the last three digits gives a greater degree of precision within each category. A ninth digit serves to verify the previous digits. The supplementary vocabulary may be used to expand the description of the subject of a contract. The items are made up of an alphanumeric code with a corresponding wording allowing further details to be added regarding the specific nature or destination of the goods to be purchased. The alphanumeric code is made up of: * a first level comprising a letter corresponding to a section; * a second level comprising four digits, the first three of which denote a subdivision and the last one being for verification purposes.
333	Activity Coding List for Harmonised European Time Use Surveys	http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm	The Harmonised European Time Use (HETUS) activity coding list is based on international practices and previous classifications of daily activities used in Europe. The coding system and index were tested and revised on the basis of time use pilot surveys in 18 countries. The final system was completed in 2000 and revised in 2008. The European activity coding list allows several groupings of activities depending on the purpose of the analysis.
334	Classification of Forest Products	http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm?TargetUrl=ACT_OTH_DFLT_LAYOUT&StrNom=FORESTPROD&StrLanguageCode=EN	This classification is designed to cover the wood and wood-based products for which FAO and ECE collect statistics on a regular basis. Included is wood taken from forests or from trees outside the forest, bark and cork; charcoal; wood and wood-based materials resulting from the first processing of the wood available from forest operations (including sawnwood, railway sleepers, veneer sheets, wood pulp and wood residues); and materials resulting from further processing of some of these materials (e.g. wood-base panels, paper and paperboard); waste paper and recoverable wood products. Manufactured articles of wood and paper (as opposed to materials) are excluded as outside the regular data collection programmes of FAO and ECE. Moreover, this classification does not attempt to cover non-wood forest products such as small ornamental trees cut for special purposes; nuts, berries, seeds, roots, or other parts of plants gathered in forest areas; gums, balsams, lacs, etc.; wood derivatives such as turpentine, tall oil, sulphite dye and other chemicals. Forestry operations and services such as reforestation, forest protection (including fire protection and fire fighting) are also excluded, along with other forest-based activities such as protection and management of watersheds, of forest wildlife and of forest recreational areas. Criteria of classification: Considerations incorporated in the formulation of subdivisions in the classification include: a) chief component material; b) stage of manufacture; c) technology applied in production; d) purpose or intended use. So far as possible, each group is confined to only one stage of manufacture i.e.: a) crude materials; b) products of first processing; c) products of further processing. An important consideration was the harmonization with the major international classifications.
335	SfB classification	http://www.sfb-online.de	The goal is to be able to work permanently with a current system, which is closely aligned with the practice, and which is designed in a work-based manner. After several printouts and various conventionally prepared updates, the SfB has been freely accessible since 2009 in an online version. In the future, SfB-Online will receive an update every year. The content processing is still done in the tried and tested cooperation, but internally in an online procedure based on a wiki. The ekz provides for the hosting of the SfB-Online and the technical support. Characteristic for SfB-Online is the simple search for class texts and the comfortable navigation due to the strongly pronounced linking. The structure of SfB-Online also provides that more information about the systematization language can be stored more than before. The goal of this online publication is to provide the updates and changes not only to the four libraries, but to all SfB users in a timely and free manner. Close co-ordination with ekz ensures that their services are based on the current foundation and that the libraries have the same.
336	FishBase Classification	http://fishbase.sinica.edu.tw/tools/Classification/ClassificationList.php	The classification schema above genus level is limited in FishBase to classes, orders, families and subfamilies ranks (the latter not yet displayed). It has the advantage to keep it simple; it has the disadvantage to ignore some important clades in fish phylogeny like Chondrichthyes, Teleostei, Acanthomorpha, Percomorpha.  In general, it follows Nelson's Fishes of the World (2006) with the noticeable exception of Elasmobranchii and Holocephali being elevated to class rank (see foot note). Also at family level, FishBase may follow Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes that is updated more frequently to integrate new stable groupings.  Number of taxa from Orders to Species are given for what they are, a useful tool for information and database management. The design of some analyses (so-called Biodiversity analyses) that uses these numbers must be carefully assessed before processing.  Catalog of Fishes gives also number of species, including available names in the sense of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, which we don't have. Possible discrepancies between the species and genera numbers are explained in Bailly (2010). Finally, Wiley and Johnson (2010) just published a new classification for Teleostei. They propose to stabilize several hypotheses published recently or some (long) time ago by listing the known evidences (synapomorphies). FishBase will follow this new arrangement as soon as the ichthyological community endorses it, e.g., as published in a next version of Fishes of the World. In the meantime, to avoid confusion for non-specialists, we hold on the current one.  Total count of Genera: 4991. Total count of Species: 32233.
337	Classification of Living and Fossil Genera of Decapod Crustaceans	http://www.researchgate.net/publication/39064758_A_Classification_of_Living_and_Fossil_Genera_of_Decapod_Crustaceans	We present an updated classification for the entire Crustacea Decapoda, listing all known families and genera organized by higher taxonomic groups and including estimates of the number of species in every genus. All taxonomic names are also linked to the verified literature in which they were described, the first compilation of its kind for the Decapoda. To arrive at this compilation, we began with the classification scheme provided by Martin & Davis (2001) for extant families, updated the higher classification and included the fossil taxa. The resultant framework was then populated with the currently valid genera and an estimate of species numbers within each genus. Our resulting classification, spanning both extant (living) and fossil taxa, is the first comprehensive estimate of taxonomic diversity within the entire Decapoda. The classification consists of 233 families of decapods containing 2,725 genera and an estimated 17,635 species (including both extant and fossil species). Of the families in our classification, 53 are exclusively fossil, 109 contain both fossil and extant species, and 71 are extant only. The current estimate for extant species is 14,756, whereas 2,979 species are known exclusively as fossils.
338	Classification of the Recent Crustacea		This volume is an attempt to provide the reader, whether a seasoned systematist or a beginning student, with a glimpse into the enormous variety of extant crustaceans. The sheer number of categories that humans have constructed to contain and order this group is some indication of the incredible amount of morphological diversity they exhibit. But this is only a small part of the overall picture. Even if one were to grasp the full range of taxonomic diversity as presented in this classification, such knowledge would shed no light on the actual biology of these fascinating animals: their behavior, feeding, locomotion, reproduction; their relationships to other organisms; their adaptations to the environment; and other facets of their existence that fall under the heading of biodiversity. By producing this volume we are attempting to update an existing classification, produced by Tom Bowman and Larry Abele (1982), in order to arrange and update the Crustacea collection of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. This enormous and diverse collection contains an estimated four to five million specimens, making it the second largest collection of Crustacea in the Americas. While undertaking this task, it occurred to us that others might benefit from our efforts, and that perhaps a general update on the number and arrangement of the living crustacean families, along with an explanation of the systematic and classificatory changes suggested during the last two decades, might be a welcome addition to the literature.
339	Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals	http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/ghs/ghs_rev03/03files_e.html	The goal of the GHS is to identify the intrinsic hazards found in substances and mixtures and to convey hazard information about these hazards. The criteria for hazard classification are harmonized. Hazard statements, symbols and signal words have been standardized and harmonized and now form an integrated hazard communication system. The GHS will allow the hazard communication elements of the existing systems to converge. Competent authorities will decide how to apply the various elements of the GHS based on the needs of the competent authority and the target audience.
34	Thesaurus of the Board of Andalusia	http://www.observatoriodelainfancia.es/oia/comun/tesauro/tesauro_jerarquico.aspx	"The OIA thesaurus has been developed and updated from the Thesaurus of Social Issues (1993)."" The thesaurus is presented in two indexes, alphabetical and hierarchical."
340	Classification of Pesticides by Hazard	http://www.who.int/ipcs/publications/pesticides_hazard/en/	This document sets out a classification system to distinguish between the more and the less hazardous forms of selected pesticides based on acute risk to human health (that is the risk of single or multiple exposures over a relatively short period of time). It takes into consideration the toxicity of the technical active substance and also describes methods for the classification of formulations.  The document lists common technical grade pesticides and recommended classifications together with a listing of active ingredients believed to be obsolete or discontinued for use as pesticides, pesticides subject to the prior informed consent procedure (Rotterdam Convention), limitations to trade because of the Stockholm convention (POPs), and gaseous or volatile fumigants not classified under these recommendations.  This document replaces the 2004 edition of the classification. Since the previous edition of the classification was published, the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) has been further developed and is now being widely used for the classification and labeling of chemicals worldwide. For this revision of the classification, the WHO Hazard Classes have been aligned in an appropriate way with the GHS Acute Toxicity Hazard Categories for acute oral or dermal toxicity as the starting point for allocating pesticides to a WHO Hazard Class. As has always been the case, the classification of some pesticides has been adjusted to take account of severe hazards to health other than acute toxicity. The GHS Acute Toxicity Hazard Category for each pesticide is now presented alongside the existing information.
341	Classification of Eye Movement Abnormalities and Strabismus	https://nei.nih.gov/sites/default/files/nei-pdfs/cemas.pdf	The design and conceptual foundation of the CEMAS classification scheme follows traditional ideas and attempts to remain clinically pragmatic. The scheme describes three broad categories of abnormalities: 1) Horizontal Deviations, 2) Vertical Deviations and Special Forms of Strabismus, and finally, 3) Nystagmus and Other Ocular Oscillations and is comprised of eight major areas.
342	Australian and New Zealand Standard Product Classification	http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1254.0.55.001	The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) is decommissioning the Australian and New Zealand Standard Product Classification (ANZSPC) as the Australian statistical standard for products. ANZSPC was produced in 2001 as a collaboration between the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and Statistics New Zealand. It was intended that the ANZSPC become the statistical standard for the collection and presentation of product statistics in both countries. However, the recent review of product classifications, focusing on the use of ANZSPC within the ABS, found that: ANZSPC has not been adopted widely within the ABS, rather a range of collection specific classifications have been developed; a range of product classifications are required to account for different conceptual bases such as industry of origin, end use and material composition; and ANZSPC is no longer internationally comparable given the impending release of Central Product Classification (CPC) V2.0. Furthermore, consultation with Statistics New Zealand revealed that the adoption of ANZSPC throughout New Zealand has also been nominal, therefore decommissioning the ANZSPC is seen as a logical and practical approach by Statistics New Zealand. The ABS plans to adopt the international CPC V2.0 as the overarching framework for product classifications, that is, product classifications used within the ABS will concord with CPC V2.0 to at least 3 digit level. The CPC is a multipurpose classification covering all goods and services and recent developments to increase the level of detail and comparability with other international standards has positioned it well to fulfil the function of an overarching reference product classification for Australia and New Zealand, taking on the role intended for the ANZSPC.
343	Intellectual Property Subject Thesaurus	http://vocabularyserver.com/ip/	836 terms, 322 relations between terms, 463 non-preferred terms.
344	International Children's Rights Thesaurus	http://www.unicef-irc.org/php/Thesaurus/	The International Children's Rights Thesaurus consists of a core of several hundred terms that express the specific rights and concerns of the Convention on the Rights of the Child together with a number of more general terms that set these issues in their economic and social context. The criterion for inclusion of descriptors in the Thesaurus is their usefulness for indexing and retrieving documents on issues covered by the CRC. The International Children's Rights Thesaurus has been created as a tool for indexing and retrieving documents from the point of view of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).
345	JURIVOC	https://www.bger.ch/ext/jurivoc/live/de/jurivoc/Jurivoc.jsp?interfaceLanguage=german	JURIVOC, the juridical thesaurus of the Federal Supreme Court and the former Federal Insurance Court (now the Social Departments of the Federal Supreme Court), was created in cooperation with the Swiss legal libraries. The main part is made up of juridical terms. Moreover, it contains terms borrowed from other fields (eg, geography, medicine, etc.), insofar as they are necessary for the specification of a legal indexing aspect. JURIVOC is systematic, ie the terms (descriptors) are subdivided into hierarchies, which are essentially based on the foundations of the systematic collection of legal rights in federal law. JURIVOC is monohierarchic, which means that each term (descriptor) is assigned to a single generic term. This thesaurus does not claim to be strictly scientific, but meets the practical needs of an intellectual indexation of legal documents.
346	Legislative Indexing Vocabulary	http://www.loc.gov/lexico/servlet/lexico	Over 10,000 terms. More than half of the terms are approved indexing terms while the remainder are USE references to lead users to authorized terms. The access vocabulary has been improved with the gain of over 100 new terms over the previous edition. The format employed in this vocabulary facilitates the assignment of indexing terms to a document at the most appropriate levels of specificity or generality and from a variety of points of view. Cross references show both hierarchical and collateral relations among terms. The former provide a choice of indexing levels for many concepts, while the latter assist in leading the user to relevant indexing terms reflecting other aspects of the topic. The great variety of subject areas of research assigned to the Congressional Research Service make this indexing vocabulary a mixture of general and specific, popular and technical terminology. Current terminology is aimed for as well as an optimum degree of compatibility with Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH). Collaboration with the staff of the Library's Cataloging Policy and Support Office has resulted in achieving a high degree of compatibility between the two systems, and many LIV indexing terms are found in the current edition of the LCSH and in the online and card catalogs of the Library. For use with the THOMAS Bill Summary & Status Databases prior to the 111th Congress.
347	National Criminal Justice Thesaurus	https://www.ncjrs.gov/app/search/thesaurussearch.aspx	Use Thesaurus Term Search to search for materials in the NCJRS Abstracts Database using an NCJRS controlled vocabulary. This controlled vocabulary is used to assign relevant indexing terms to the documents in the NCJRS collection.
348	Seattle City Clerk Thesaurus	http://clerk.seattle.gov/~public/thesaurus/newtoc.htm	Subjects dealt with most completely are those having to do with the main activities of City government. For example, public works, transportation, and housing are each a main focus of City activities, so there are many terms present to permit specific indexing. Geographical concepts are also an emphasis; terms are included for most Seattle neighborhoods and for major geographic features. Topics which are included in only the briefest way (i.e. few terms) are those which only indirectly relate to Seattle City government's activities. This thesaurus consists of two main parts. The first is the subject classification, which shows the relationships between subject terms in outline form. The classification displays a hierarchical arrangement of broader and narrower terms and shows the conceptual scheme used in classifying documents. Geographic names other than those for neighborhood districts are not included in the subject classification. The second part of the thesaurus is an alphabetical list of terms. It contains both the approved subject terms and other words people commonly use to describe City activities. This part of the thesaurus gives the approved subject term to use in place of unapproved 'lead-in' words. Approved or authorized indexing terms are shown in bold type. The entry for each main term includes references to broader, narrower and related terms. Some terms also have short definitions, or scope notes. A code in the form 'AB 0123' follows each main term in the alphabetical list and precedes each term in the hierarchical subject classification. This notation allow a user to find the location of a term in the hierarchy. The thesaurus contains 1713 authorized terms and 601 lead-in or unauthorized words. The collection of terms in this thesaurus has been designed to permit clear indexing and classification of records in the Seattle City Clerk's office, but it is of limited scope.
349	Thesaurus of Historical Legislation of Spain	http://www.mcu.es/archivos/lhe/Consultas/consultaTesauro.jsp	In order to select the desired descriptor in the Thesaurus, it is presented in the form of drop-down lists linked in several hierarchical levels according to its structure. The Thesaurus is divided into 7 chapters which are subdivided into sub-chapters within Of which the descriptors around which the norms are grouped are classified 2068 terms.
35	ISOC Urban Planning Thesaurus		The purpose of a thesaurus is to gather the terminology used in a discipline or a portion of it. It is at this moment when we should mention the complexity involved in the development of a thesaurus of Urbanism, given the nature of this discipline. As a multidisciplinary science forms its theoretical corpus from the disciplines that begin to study the urban and territorial problems from their different perspectives.The result is a series of knowledge of very diverse nature united by the common denominator of the city and the territory. Interdisciplinarity is evident in the selection of the 15 thematic areas around which articulates the totality of the terms of this thesaurus. This Urbanization Thesaurus was created to be used in the URBISOC Database, a database developed in CINDOC, specialized in Urban Planning and Territorial Planning. But it is also born with the desire to become the instrument of control of vocabulary of other bases specialized in identical subjects that do not have a thesaurus of their own and do not have the necessary means to elaborate it. Their dissemination and use in these other information systems will prove their usefulness.
350	Industrial Property Thesaurus	http://thes.cindoc.csic.es/index_PROIND_esp.php	As a result of these phases, the Thesaurus has been configured in 24 sub-abbreviations that include a total of 1,702 terms, of which 829 correspond to descriptors and 873 to referrals. As a programmatic goal of normalization of automated legal terminology, with a view to obtaining Sensitive improvements in the treatment, recovery, exchange and compatibilization of legal information resources of all kinds, it is intended to stimulate the use of this Industrial Property Thesaurus, which will allow to be able to present, with all the guarantees, in the local, autonomous, national forums Or international companies a product suitable for incorporation into the automated systems of management of legal information related to Industrial Property.
351	Electoral Justice Thesaurus	http://www.tse.jus.br/hotsites/catalogo-publicacoes/pdf/tesauro/Tesauro_web_v2.pdf	The new version features 15,814 entries, of which 8,186 systematize different subjects, 6,359 refer to the national toponymy and 1,269 to the international toponymy. It is also an extension of focus: the new thesaurus carries with it all the riches and specificities of our language and As a working tool, it allows us to standardize the technical treatment of the contents in the information systems existing in the Electoral Court. As a tool to help in the search for information, it guarantees to the various social actors involved in the electoral process the Access to the information requested.
352	SAIJ Thesaurus of Argentine Law	http://admin.tcda.infojus.gov.ar/saij/index.php	The Thesaurus SAIJ of Argentine Law (TSDA) is a thesaurus of Law and, more precisely, of Argentine Law, which was taken into account not only the academic voices but also the current customs and customs, beyond the technicalities. It is only a compendium of theoretical terms since in the compilation of voices also the local idioms were taken into account, like for example Corralito financier.The TSDA is characterized by contain terminology with a high degree of conceptual specificity presenting not only legal terms but Also non-legal voices, which were duly standardized by the tool, to relate to one or more terms with transcendence in the field of law.
353	Australian and New Zealand Standard Commodity Classification	http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1254.0	The ASCC classifies domestically produced transportable goods. Links are specified to the Harmonized System (HS), the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) and the Australian Standard Industrial Classification (ASIC). The commodities are those collected in respect of 1989-90.
354	Standard Economic Sector Classifications of Australia	http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1218.0	This publication describes the suite of economic sector classifications used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) to produce Australia's official economic sector statistics. The classifications are: Standard Institutional Sector Classification of Australia (SISCA); Public/Private Classification; Level of Government Classification; Jurisdiction Classification; Type of Legal Organisation (TOLO). They are used in the compilation and publication of the National Accounts, Government Finance and International Accounts statistics as well as other component economic indicators. The purpose of sector classification is to identify and group all economic units which share common organisational and operational characteristics. Units within the same sector may be expected to react in a sufficiently similar fashion to market, fiscal and monetary forces to make aggregation meaningful for the purpose of economic analysis. Sector classifications provide an integrated framework for the collection, analysis and dissemination of sector data for the economy.
355	Standard Australian Classification of Countries	http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1269.0Main+Features1Second%20Edition?OpenDocument	The scope of the SACC is all countries, as defined above, currently existing in the world. Most countries are separately identified in the classification, even though many of them are statistically insignificant in the Australian context. A small number of geographic areas have not been separately identified but have been included in residual (not elsewhere classified) categories. Most of these entities have no permanent civilian population and are not significant in terms of social or economic statistics. This comprehensive coverage makes the classification useful for a range of applications and increases its longevity.
356	Australian Standard Classification of Religious Groups	http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1266.0	The scope of the classification is all religions and subsets of religions in the world as defined above. In practice, only those religious groups that have a significant number of affiliated persons in Australia are separately identified in the classification structure. However, all other religions are covered and are included in the most appropriate residual category (Miscellaneous, Other, or Not elsewhere classified categories) of the classification. The code structure of the classification also allows the identification of religious groups not separately identified, if such a need arises. (...) The classification structure also includes a broad group that covers 'Secular Beliefs and Other Spiritual Beliefs and No Religious Affiliation' which could be considered to be inconsistent with the basis of the classification as described above and outside the scope of the religion topic. This broad group has been included for practical reasons and to make the classification more useful. Many statistical and administrative applications need to accommodate the whole range of responses to a question on religion, including personal spiritual beliefs, secular beliefs and the response 'No Religion'.
357	Australian Standard Classification of Languages	http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1267.0Main+Features12011?OpenDocument	All world languages are in scope of the classification. Languages with significant numbers of speakers in Australia are separately identified within the classification structure. Actively spoken Australian Indigenous languages are also separately identified. Languages which are not separately identified are included in the most appropriate residual category of the classification. Extinct or dead languages spoken for religious or academic purposes are included in the most appropriate residual category of the classification. However, if sufficient numbers of an extinct or dead language are spoken in Australia, it is separately identified in the classification, for example Latin. Sign languages are defined as a communication system using gestures rather than speech or writing (The Macquarie Dictionary (Fifth Edition, 2009), and are included in the classification. Languages excluded from the classification cover those not commonly used as a means of communicating between people, such as computer languages.
358	Australian Standard Classification of Education	http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/F501C031BD9AC9C5CA256AAF001FCA33	The Australian Standard Classification of Education (ASCED) is a new Australian standard classification and replaces the ABS Classification of Qualifications (ABSCQ). ASCED is comprised of two component classifications, Level of Education and Field of Education. It provides a basis for comparable administrative and statistical data on educational activities and attainment classified by level and field. The publication provides details of the conceptual basis of ASCED, the structure of the classification, definitions for all categories of level and field and concordances with other education classifications.
36	SPINES Thesaurus	http://vocabularios.caicyt.gov.ar/spines/	It consists of a controlled and structured vocabulary consisting of more than 10,000 terms (descriptors and non descriptors) and about 77,000 semantic relationships that refer to development, both in its scientific and technological, as well as in economic and social, in the The SPINES Thesaurus, developed within the framework of the intergovernmental cooperation program in the field of scientific and technical information, was conceived as a key instrument of an international information exchange system.
360	Australian Standard Classification of Drugs of Concern	http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1248.0	The Australian Standard Classification of Drugs of Concern (ASCDC) is the Australian statistical standard for classifying data relating to drugs which are considered to be of concern in Australian society. The ASCDC is essentially a classification of type of drug of concern based on the chemical structure, mechanism of action and effect on physiological activity of the drugs of concern. The classification of Type of Drug is described as the 'main classification structure' throughout the ASCDC document. The ASCDC is intended for use in the collection, classification, storage and dissemination of all statistical, administrative and service delivery data relating to drugs of concern. There are two additional classifications, Form of Drug and Method of Drug Use. The ASCDC assists government planners, policy analysts and social researchers by providing a consistent framework for the classification of drug-related data. The use of the standard definitions, classifications and coding procedures detailed in the ASCDC helps to ensure the comparability and compatibility of data derived from a range of different statistical, administrative and service provision systems at both the state and national level. The ASCDC is designed to collect, classify and disseminate data on drugs of concern. Because most drugs have the potential to be considered of concern in certain circumstances or contexts, the scope of the classification is all drugs. However, only those drugs noted by key stakeholders in the health, welfare, and crime and justice sectors to be of current concern in the Australian context of harm minimisation are identified in the main classification structure. This includes all drugs of concern which may be identified using the criteria listed above (see Identifying the Base Level Units of the Classification, above). It should also be noted that the main classification structure of the ASCDC does not distinguish between drugs of concern on the basis of their legality. Further, it is not a suitable vehicle for the classification of the different chemical or physical forms in which a drug may be available, and should not be used to determine the different methods of drug use. These are correlative variables for which the 'Form of Drug' and 'Method of Drug Use' classifications have been developed.
361	Australian Standard Classification of Cultural and Ethnic Groups	http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1249.0	The Australian Standard Classification of Cultural and Ethnic Groups (ASCCEG) is the Australian statistical standard for classifying ancestry data within the Australian population. ASCCEG has been developed based on the geographic area in which a group originated, developed or settled noting, similarity of groups in terms of social and cultural characteristics. ASCCEG is intended for use in the collection, aggregation and dissemination of data relating to the cultural diversity of the Australian population.  The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) developed ASCCEG to satisfy wide community interest in the ethnic and cultural composition of the Australian population and the characteristics of particular migrant community groups. The classification is intended to provide a standard to meet a growing statistical, administrative and service delivery need for data relating to these interests. The adoption of ASCCEG by statistical, administrative and service delivery agencies improved the comparability and compatibility of data on ethnicity from diverse sources.
362	Australian Culture and Leisure Classifications	http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4902.0	The Australian Culture and Leisure Classifications (ACLC) are part of the commitment of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) to develop national standards for culture and leisure information. They comprise three separate classifications, covering culture and leisure related industries, products and occupations. The classifications of the ACLC focus on the economic side of culture and leisure activities - that is, the way culture and leisure activities are linked to the economy through direct expenditure and employment. The ACLC does this through three classifications: Industry, Product and Occupation. The Industry Classification lists industries consisting of organisations for which the main activity is the production or provision of culture and leisure goods and services, and is based on the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC). The Product Classification consists of a list of culture and leisure goods and services (together known as products). These products are the primary outputs of the industries listed in the Industry Classification; in addition, they may also be produced by other industries (for example, museum services may be provided by a business in the mining industry). The Occupation Classification, which is based on the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO), lists occupations which are predominantly culture or leisure in nature. These classifications are adopted by the ABS and organisations outside of the ABS for survey design, organising administrative data and disseminating culture and leisure information. This is the second edition of the ACLC, following the first edition developed in 2001. This edition reflects a minor review undertaken to update ACLC concordances to the new editions of standard ABS classifications. A summary of the changes can be found in the appendices of the publication.
363	Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations	http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1220.0	The Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO) First Edition (cat. no. 1220.0) was released in September 2006. Revision 1 is the first update to ANZSCO First Edition and includes minor changes to the classification structure and definitional changes for some occupations. This product comprises an explanation of the conceptual basis of the classification, the classification structure and definitions for all levels of the classification (major, sub-major, minor and unit groups and occupations). The primary purpose of this product is to aid in the interpretation of ABS and Statistics New Zealand occupation statistics classified to ANZSCO.
364	Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification	http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1292.0	The Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC) 2006 (cat no. 1292.0) was released in February 2006. As a result of using this new classification in statistical collections, the ABS identified some areas where clarifications are needed. Revisions to ANZSIC 2006 are shown in this release. The revisions to ANZSIC 2006 are minor, maintaining the scope, concepts and structure. It concentrates on the revision of primary activities to capture new and emerging activities, clarifies class definitions to overcome practical difficulties in implementation and corrects minor errors and omissions. The minor revisions facilitate the consistent interpretation of the classification by all concerned and allow the inclusion of activities especially for industries that are subject to frequent changes (e.g. information technology).
365	Australian Statistical Geography Standard	http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1270.0.55.001	The ASGS brings all the regions for which the ABS publishes statistics within the one framework and will be used by the ABS for the collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics from 1 July 2011. It is the framework for understanding and interpreting the geographical context of statistics published by the ABS. The ABS also encourages the use of the ASGS by other organisations to improve the comparability and usefulness of statistics generally.  While there are superficial similarities between the ASGS and the Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC), it is important to recognise that the two are fundamentally different and there are significant differences between their respective regions, both in their geographical extent and their conceptual foundation. As a whole, the ASGS represents a more comprehensive, flexible and consistent way of defining Australia's statistical geography than the ASGC.

367	Thesaurus of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights	https://www.huridocs.org/resource/thesaurus-of-economic-social-and-cultural-rights/	This thesaurus does not focus as heavily on synonyms as other traditional thesauri. Instead, it takes a human rights approach by cross-referencing related ESC rights, concepts, terminology in order to reflect the interrelationships between many rights. The Categorical Index presents rights, terminology and potential violations in a structured and logical format. The Thematic Index offers many routes to identifying and locating material, and the full entries (Alphabetical Thesaurus) serve as an access point for the plethora of documents relating to ESC rights. The principal goal of this thesaurus is to serve as a tool to introduce readers to economic, social and cultural rights, related concepts, issues, and potential violations of these rights. It is not a definitive resource, nor do we believe that one could ever exist concerning ESC rights.
368	TRIBLEX Case-Law Database Thesaurus Keywords	http://www.ilo.org/dyn/triblex/triblexmain.byKeyword	Triblex is the case law database of the ILO Administrative Tribunal. Triblex allows users to browse Tribunal case law by session, organization or keyword. The site also features an advanced search function which allows users to search by term, date, organization, session, keyword, or judgment number. Triblex also offers the enabling statute and rules of the Administrative Tribunal. Because researching Administrative Tribunal case law can be challenging to the unfamiliar researcher, one of Triblex's most useful features is its in-depth 'About us' section. This section provides a wealth of explanatory information on the Tribunal, its composition, and its history.

37	Thesaurus for Use in College and University Archives	http://www.archivists.org/publications/epubs/thesaurus.asp	The approximately 1,300 terms in this thesaurus come from many sources; before weeding, there were nearly 5,000 seed terms that originated in several existing controlled and uncontrolled vocabularies. A few terms have been added by the editor to fill obvious omissions in the hierarchy, and reference has been made both to the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) thesaurus and to Helen Willa Samuels’s Varsity Letters for enlightenment and clarity, although neither of these sources was incorporated. LCSH is the preferred term unless the editor found a strong sense of the term's abandonment in contemporary usage by comparing the LCSH term with the terms used in the other thesauri. Some terms may inspire controversy; in such cases the policy of preferring LCSH over other terms was the rule. Submission of the terms in this thesaurus as new terms or as cross- references to the Library of Congress through the Subject Authority Cooperative Program of the Program for Cooperative Cataloging (SACO) are encouraged. This thesaurus is a set of terms for use by any college or university archives in the United States for describing its holdings.

371	WITNESS Media Archive Topic Terms	http://bartoc.org/sites/default/files/skos_files/WITNESS.csv	At present, only our Topic Terms are accessible online, but we will be adding our other vocabularies in the near future. This thesaurus of topic terms is exportable in various XML schemas. We welcome others to use and adapt these terms for their own purposes. Included in the Topics are broad concepts (e.g. Accountability, Due Process, Women’s Rights) as well as more literal or visually descriptive terms (e.g. Scenics and Beauty Shots, Crowds). Some terms are applicable in both senses (e.g. Water). In some cases, terms are selected because of frequency of use or currency within the human rights community (e.g. Sex Workers). Some terms are also selected because content creators prefer to use them (e.g. Feminicide). 334 terms, 194 relations between terms, 24 non-preferred terms. The WITNESS thesauri were developed to meet the unique needs of audiovisual content in a human rights context.
372	Finnish General Thesaurus	http://finto.fi/ysa/fi/	Outdated, do not use. The maintenance of General Finnish Thesaurus YSA and its Swedish language counterpart Allärs ended in 2019. The vocabulary replacing these two is General Finnish Ontology YSO. Updates to YSO are no longer added to YSA or Allärs. YSO is a trilingual (Finnish, Swedish, English) machine-readable version of YSA and Allärs, enhanced with linked data capabilities.

YSA has been used in databases since 1987.
373	Finnish Music Thesaurus	http://finto.fi/musa/	Outdated, please, do not use. The Finnish Music Thesaurus (MUSA) was one of the language specific vocabularies for music indexing, which complied with the principles and structure of the Finnish General Thesaurus (YSA). The Music Thesaurus was intended for for indexing and information retrieval of books and articles on music, as well as all recorded music (printed music, sound recordings, etc.). Glossary guided content describers and information seekers to use a common language. The compiling of the Music Thesaurus followed the Finnish thesaurus preparation and maintenance instructions (SFS 5471). The Thesaurus included the Swedish language music terms in CILLA which were availabe by swithcinge the language in the user interface.

38	UK Archival Thesaurus	http://www.ukat.org.uk/	UKAT is a subject thesaurus which has been created for the archive sector in the United Kingdom. It is a controlled vocabulary which archives can use when indexing their collections and catalogues. UKAT was created between June 2003 and August 2004 from subject terms contributed by individual archives, archive projects and users of archives. The backbone of UKAT is the UNESCO Thesaurus. However, while UNESCO covers a broad range of subject areas, it often lacks the depth of detailed terminology required by archives for indexing. It was therefore decided that UKAT should extend and adapt UNESCO to incorporate indexing terms which repositories and projects had devised themselves or incorporated from other schemes, such as Library of Congress Subject Headings or the British Education Thesaurus. UKAT has thus been created as a thesaurus conforming to international standards, with the coherent structure of UNESCO, but also significantly enhanced to include terms of relevance to the archive community and its users. Particular emphasis has been given to incorporating terms reflecting the histories and experiences of groups which are under-represented among archive users, to encourage their participation in the archival heritage in line with national priorities for the sector. The key aims of UKAT are: to improve access to archives by subject; to ensure that users of archives can carry out effective subject searches of the national archives network; and to promote the involvement in archives by groups which are under-represented among archive users, by providing subject terms which reflect their histories and experiences.
380		https://www.departments.bucknell.edu/biology/resources/msw3/	Although the database will be updated in the future (edited by DeeAnn M. Reeder and Kristofer M. Helgen), it is not, and will not be continuously updated. The names are organized in a hierarchy that includes Order, Suborder, Family, Subfamily, Genus, Species and Subspecies. Records include the following fields: Scientific name, Author's name and year described, Original publication citation, Common name, Type Species, Type Locality, Distribution, Comments, Status, Synonyms. It is hoped that this database on the World Wide Web can be used as a convenient on-line reference for identifying or verifying recognized scientific names and for taxonomic research.
381	International Virtual Observatory Alliance Thesaurus	http://www.ivoa.net/rdf/Vocabularies/vocabularies-20091007/IVOAT/	The current vocabulary has 2890 concepts, of which 274 are 'TopConcepts'. The goal is to provide a general vocabulary foundation to which other, more specialised, vocabularies can be added as needed, and to provide a good 'lingua franca' for the creation of vocabulary mappings.
382	InterWATER Thesaurus	http://www.ircwash.org/thesaurus	It can be used for indexing information; for searching or retrieving information; and as a translation tool for English, French and Spanish water and sanitation terms. The thesaurus originates from the collaboration of IRC with organisations from the United Kingdom, France, Peru, Jordan, Burkina Faso and Thailand.
383	Multilingual Thesaurus of Geosciences	http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780080364315	The Multilingual Thesaurus contains 5823 key terms expressed as descriptors (preferred terms) or non-descriptors (non-preferred terms) in the language versions of the MT. The Multilingual Thesaurus (MT) is compatible with major international and national bibliographic databases and indexing vocabularies. The English (American) version of the MT is compatible with the AGI (American Geological Institute) GeoRef Thesaurus, the French version with the INIST/BRGM (Institute de l'Information Scientifique et Technique/Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières) PASCAL/GEODE Lexique, and the German with the BGR (Bundesanstalt für Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe) GEOLINE Thesaurus. The other language versions are compatible with national thesauri used in Russia (VSEGEI), Spain (ITGE/GEOMINER), Italy (CNR/GEODOC) and Finland (Geological Survey of Finland/FINGEO). The MT gives the documentary equivalents of major geoscience concepts in the languages included at present. The MT is also an operational tool for the development and management of other national geoscience thesauri in a manner that ensures compatibility with other major geoscience information systems. A most interesting aspect of the MT is the possibility of developing multilingual search facilities, i.e. searches can be performed in any of the languages of the MT, and documents may be retrieved that contain the corresponding term in any of the other languages of the MT. At the Geological Survey of Finland the MT has been already been used to enable such multilingual searches. The Finnish index terms or English index terms used in the databases to describe the content can be linked through the thesaurus function of the TRIP system to the corresponding terms in all languages of the MT making all terms for the same concept synomyms irrespective of the language.
384	Health Sciences Descriptors	http://decs.bvs.br/I/homepagei.htm	The concepts that characterize the DeCS vocabulary are organized in a tree structure allowing a search on broader or narrower terms or on all terms from the same tree within the hierarchical structure. DeCS is a dynamic vocabulary totaling 30,895 descriptors, of which 26,664 come from MeSH, and 4658 are exclusively DeCS. There is an addition of 2051 hierarchic codes from DeCS categories in 1491 MeSH descriptors. The following are the DeCS categories and their total number of descriptors: Health Surveillance (828); Homeopathy (1,944), Public Health (3,491); and Science and Health (219). The sum is greater than the total number of descriptors, since a descriptor may occur more than once in the hierarchy. By being dynamic, it records a permanent process of change including the development of new areas of terminology. With the creation of the national, institutional and thematic VHLs, search strategies were made available in the various topics in order to facilitate the retrieval of the existing literature. DeCS was created to serve as a unique language in indexing articles from scientific journals, books, congress proceedings, technical reports, and other types of materials, as well as for searching and retrieving subjects from scientific literature from information sources available on the Virtual Health Library (VHL) such as LILACS, MEDLINE, and others.
385	Center for International Rehabilitation Research Information and Exchange Thesaurus	http://www.naric.com/cirrie_sql/database/thesaurus/	The CIRRIE Thesaurus is an alphabetical listing of approved terms for searching the CIRRIE Database.

389	NASA Thesaurus		The Hierarchical Listing With Definitions contains all subject terms and USE cross references currently approved for use, and displays the full hierarchical structure for each term along with a definition when available. In addition, the listing has been developed to serve as an orthographic authority for upper/lowercase forms of all terms and cross references. The term-added date, displayed for all terms added after April 1988, is also given. The listing includes terms appearing in the NASA Thesaurus, Preliminary Edition (December 1967), the NASA Thesaurus Alphabetical Update (September 1971), the NASA Thesaurus (1982, 1985, 1988, 1994, and 1998 editions), and other terms approved for use through the end of January 2012. Over 18,400 terms, 4,300 definitions, and approximately 4,500 USE references are contained in the Hierarchical Listing With Definitions. The Rotated Term Display is a ready-reference tool that provides thousands of additional 'access points' to the thesaurus terminology. It contains the postable terms and nonpostable terms found in the Hierarchical Listing arranged in a KWIC (key-word-in-context) index. It is a useful companion to the Volume 1 listing, containing approximately 52,000 entries.
39	United Nations Bibliographical Information System Thesaurus	http://metadata.un.org/thesaurus/	The multilingual UNBIS Thesaurus contains the terminology used in subject analysis of documents and other materials relevant to United Nations programmes and activities. It is multidisciplinary in scope, reflecting the Organization’s wide-ranging concerns. The terms included are meant to reflect accurately, clearly, concisely and with a sufficient degree of specificity, matters of importance and interest to the United Nations. In addition, since the inception of the Thesaurus in 1981, two primary criteria in the selection of descriptors have been: a) consistency with the terminology used by the Organization itself as reflected in its documents; and b) compatibility with terms included in thesauri produced or utilized within the UN System, in order to facilitate exchange of information with other organizations. The organizations of the United Nations System, such as the World Bank, ILO, WHO, FAO, IAEA and Unesco, are lead agencies in their particular areas of activity and their choice of descriptors has been preferred. It is used as the subject authority of the United Nations Bibliographic Information System (UNBIS) and has been incorporated as the subject lexicon of the United Nations Official Document System.
390	Alexandria Digital Library Feature Type Thesaurus		The Feature Type Thesaurus contains a hierarchical scheme of terms for typing gazetteer entries; that is, for typing named geographic places. It is intended for general use for many types of gazetteers and as a shared vocabulary for interoperability among gazetteers. It has been designed to be used with the Alexandria Digital Library (ADL) Gazetteer.
392	Herb Thesaurus	https://www.toriorr.com/herb-thesaurus-project	This thesaurus functions as a means for indexing articles, photos, and web pages on some of the basic identifying characteristics of herbs. It is designed for the hobbyist or recreational gardener rather than scientist or medical reference. The preferred terminology is that of a home gardener rather than a herbalists or botanists since they are the targeted end-user. (...) This mini-thesaurus contains preferred terms selected based on common usage, and the cross-references are made from the non-preferred terms. Scope notes have been added where necessary. In the hierarchical display, facets appear in bold text, in the alphabetical display preferred terms appear in bold text. This thesaurus functions as a means for indexing articles, photos, and web pages on some of the basic identifying characteristics of herbs. It is designed for the hobbyist or recreational gardener rather than scientist or medical reference. The preferred terminology is that of a home gardener rather than a herbalists or botanists since they are the targeted end-user.
393	The Astronomy Thesaurus	http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/library/thesaurus/	The main aim in producing this reference work is to try to standardise the terminology in the field of astronomy for the purposes of aiding unambiguous library cataloguing and more precise recall of data from computer databases. The thesaurus is intended for use by astronomy librarians and scientists. Its compilation was originally requested during a meeting of Commission 5 (Documentation) of the International Astronomical Union at the New Delhi General Assembly of the IAU in 1984. Vocabulary control has become essential in the use of online databases, particularly where those responsible for data input and for searching databases are nonspecialists. Consistency, particularly in the input to computerised databases, is imperative if there is to be high precision recall in information retrieval. Conversely, for those accessing databases (the output process), the selection of relevant terms or those most specific to the information request, will result in higher precision recall. The thesaurus is also designed to give the librarian, cataloguer or indexer, as well as the astronomer, a context for astronomical terms with which they may not be familiar. It is envisaged that the thesaurus will be used for the following main purposes: 1. Assigning keyterms to scientific papers; this is usually best done by the authors themselves, rather than by non-specialists. If the thesaurus is to serve as originally intended by Commission 5 of the IAU - to standardise the astronomical terminology -, then authors should use only the upper case terms in the thesaurus in their keyterm lists. 2. Extraction of references from databases, when the use of the same list of terms as is used by the authors can be expected to result in high precision recall of relevant data. 3. Assisting in the updating of library classification schemes. 4. It may be included in 'intelligent' databases, to help the user select alternatives or extensions to a searcher's initial list, as in proximity searching. Other uses suggested to us have been as a source of terms for exclusion as passwords for observatory computers and as a supplementary dictionary of words used by a spelling checker for word processors.
394	The Alcohol and Other Drugs Thesaurus	https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/current/AOD/	Initial development of the AOD Thesaurus started with collecting terms and term relationships from many sources; search requests received for ETOH and NCADI databases; document titles and index terms; more than 40 special thesauri; and NIAAA's Reports to Congress on Alcohol and Health and other publications. Major sources used for reference and guidance included the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Lexicon of Alcohol and Drug Terms, developed jointly with NIAAA; NLM's Medical Subject HeadingsInternational Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions; the DSM–III and draft DSM–IV; the Thesaurus of Psychological Indexing Terms (PsyclNFO); the Thesaurus of ERIC Descriptors; and the Thesaurus of Sociological Indexing Terms (Sociological Abstracts). The multitude of terms collected from these sources were organized into hierarchies, which revealed many synonyms and near-synonyms. A conceptual analysis process known as semantic factoring further clarified the structure and led to a smaller vocabulary of conceptual building blocks. The resulting structure was thoroughly field-tested through a query formulation and indexing test. Analyzing the results from multiple indexers for important terms missed, different indexers using different terms to express the same idea, terms assigned erroneously, and terms needed but missing from the Thesaurus, the developers identified areas requiring clarification, redundancies between areas, missing cross-references, the need for more or better scope notes, and areas where detail could be reduced. Further refinements were made in the second edition based on indexing and searching experience: Descriptors were added, overly specific descriptors were pruned, the structure was improved, and many scope notes and relationships were added. Thesaurus maintenance for this edition started with identifying key, recent sources in the AOD field, including a wide variety of publications such as NIAAA’s Ninth Report to the U.S. Congress on Alcohol and Health, a number of issues of Alcohol Health & Research World, the Institute of Medicine’s Reducing Risks for Mental Disorders: Frontiers for Preventive Intervention Research, the draft International Classification of Preventive Trials, and of course, the most recent editions of various thesauri: NLM’s Medical Subject Headings, the Thesaurus of Psychological Terms, and the Thesaurus of Sociological Indexing Terms. Terms and term relationships from the preceding publications in addition to many other sources, including the entire Identifier (ID) field from the ETOH database, which is used to assign terms or concepts that are not in the AOD Thesaurus or for terms that are not designated ETOH descriptors. An analysis of the terms in this field helped the thesaurus development team identify missing concepts and thesaurus terms that should be designated ETOH descriptors. NIAAA is committed to the maintenance of the AOD Thesaurus as an ongoing process driven by user feedback. Users are strongly encouraged to comment on any aspect of the thesaurus. The thesaurus presents a structured collection of concepts and terms intended to facilitate indexing and retrieval, support research and program planning through conceptual structure and definitions, and improve communication through standardized terminology. The thesaurus provides guidance to the indexers for request-oriented (or user-centered) indexing. It organizes concepts collected from search requests into an easily grasped hierarchical structure that serves as a framework or checklist in analyzing documents. The logical structure of the Thesaurus communicates user interests to the indexer. Its controlled vocabulary expresses each concept unambiguously through one term, called a descriptor, that is used in indexing and can thus be used with confidence in searching. Synonyms lead to descriptors: polydrug use leads to AA2.6 multiple drug use; chemical abuse, drug abuse, and substance abuse all lead to GC2 AOD abuse; nerve cellneurocyte both lead to and XX2.2 neuron. The thesaurus is also very useful for free-text searching (searching based on words in the title or abstract). An exhaustive free-text search must include all terms that might be used to express the searched-for concept. This requires query term expansion: In synonym expansion, expand the query term XX2.2 neuron by adding the synonyms nerve cell and neurocyte; in hierarchic expansion, add narrower terms, such as XX2.2.2.4 dendrite and XX2.2.2.6 axon (with its synonyms, such as nerve fiber and neurite).
395	INIS Interactive Multilingual Thesaurus		The terms in the Joint Thesaurus are listed alphabetically. For each alphabetical entry, a 'word block', containing the terms associated with this particular entry, is displayed. In the word block, terms that have a hierarchical relationship to the entry are identified by the symbols BT for Broader Term, and NT for Narrower Term; a term with an affinitive relationship is identified by RT, for Related Term; terms with a preferential relationship are identified by USE or SEE, and UF for Used For, and SF for Seen For. In case of multiple USE relationships for a forbidden term, all listed descriptors should be used to index or search a given concept. In case of multiple SEE relationships, one or more of the listed descriptors should be considered for indexing or searching this concept. Over the years the INIS/ETDE Thesaurus has evolved as a result of systematic study and it contains over 30 000 terms. Using the Joint Thesaurus as a starting point, INIS, in cooperation with the Member States, has developed INIS Multilingual Thesaurus with navigation capabilities including the full thesaurus hierarchy. It is available in all official languages of the IAEA. It represents a unique multilingual thesaurus in the nuclear field and serves as a major tool for indexing and describing nuclear information and knowledge in a structured form, which assists in multilingual and semantic searches of the INIS Database.

397	Australian Standard Geographical Classification	http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/home/Australian+Standard+Geographical+Classification+%28ASGC%29	The ASGC provides seven hierarchies of geographical areas. Each structure is designed to suit different statistical purposes. This edition has four current structures. The Main Structure and the Statistical Region Structure cover the whole of Australia. The Local Government Area Structure and the Statistical District Structure cover only part of Australia. The three remaining structures, Urban Centres and Localities, Section of State and Remoteness Structures, have not been included as Census Collection Districts are no longer defined. These structures are now defined in the new Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). The ASGS has been released concurrently with the ASGC to ensure a smooth transition to the new statistical geography. The ASGS and the ASGC will both be current for 2011 however, from 1 July 2012 the ASGS will replace the ASGC. The ASGS brings all the regions for which the ABS publishes statistics within the one framework and will be used by the ABS for the collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics progressively from 1 July 2011. The ASGS is a more comprehensive, flexible and consistent way of defining Australia's statistical geography.
398	Mineral Lists	http://athena.unige.ch/athena/mineral/min_lists.html	Here are mineral lists (IMA approved mineral names and varieties names) sorted either alphabetically or arranged systematically. As every science, mineralogy is changing: new analysis often modify formulas and other datas; new minerals are discovered; others are discredited. So, consider these lists as dynamic and subject to change and error. Comments, corrections and additions are welcome. It follows Strunz classification schemes (Mineralogical Tables, VIIIth edition) and has been modified according to the systematic numbers published in the 'Lapis Mineralienverzeichnis'. It shows similarities well enough, especially when completed with space group, density, etc.

40	UNESCO Thesaurus	http://vocabularies.unesco.org/browser/thesaurus/en/	The UNESCO Thesaurus is a controlled and structured list of concepts used in subject analysis and retrieval of documents and publications in the fields of education, culture, natural sciences, social and human sciences, communication and information. Continuously enriched and updated, its multidisciplinary terminology reflects the evolution of UNESCO's programmes and activities. The first edition of the Thesaurus was released in English in 1977, with French and Spanish translations in 1983 and 1984. The second revised and restructured version was released in 1995. Today the Thesaurus is available in English, French, Russian and Spanish. Concepts are grouped into 7 broad subject areas which are broken down into microthesauri. The UNESCO Thesaurus is compliant with the ISO 25964 standard.
401	Transcription Factor Classification	http://www.gene-regulation.com/pub/databases/transfac/clSM.html	TRANSFAC® provides data on eukaryotic transcription factors, their experimentally-proven binding sites, consensus binding sequences (positional weight matrices) and regulated genes. 5 superclasses, 33 classes, 76 families, 91 subfamilies.
402	Classification of HTTP-based APIs	https://web.archive.org/web/20110824015753/http://www.nordsc.com/ext/classification_of_http_based_apis.html	This table provides a classification of HTTP-based APIs. The classification achieves an explicit differentiation between the various kinds of uses of HTTP and provides a foundation to analyse and describe the system properties induced. Providing distinct names for the API 'styles' overcomes the useless situation where APIs are named 'RESTful' and 'not so RESTful','almost RESTful', or 'unRESTful'. An API either adheres to REST's interface constraints or it does not and if it does not, there is no sense in referring to 'REST' in the API's name. Especially so because mentioning REST might cause the false impression that the achieved system would share the same system properties as RESTful systems. They do not - and it is important to understand that the system being designed might not have the expected properties. For example, caching and visibility can be ruined by tunneling operations though action names in URIs. The most important distinction to be made today is the one between the two HTTP-based API kinds HTTP-based Type I and HTTP-based Type II on the one hand and REST on the other hand. The former two, while not RESTful due to their violation of the hypermdia constraint, can be a reasonable design choice if the tight coupling they induce is acceptable for the given system. This might be the case if the expected life time of the system does not warrant the considerable work of designing a proper media type. However, it must be explicitly understood that both API kinds, 'HTTP-based Type I' and 'HTTP-based Type II' lead to systems in which clients and servers are coupled by their original design and that the evolvability properties of RESTful systems are in no way induced.
403	Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations Classification	http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/tdg/clear-part2-339.htm	A substance is dangerous goods when (a) it is listed by name in Schedule 1 and is in any form, state or concentration that meets the criteria in this Part for inclusion in at least one of the 9 classes of dangerous goods; or (b) it is not listed by name in Schedule 1 but meets the criteria in this Part for inclusion in at least one of the 9 classes of dangerous goods.
404	Pentatomoidea Classification	http://www.ndsu.nodak.edu/ndsu/rider/Pentatomoidea/Classification/classification.htm	This website contains (or will contain) a wealth of information on the various families of the Pentatomoidea (especially the Pentatomidae), and even some information that will be of general interest to Heteropterists. More information on each of these families is presented within the Systematics section of this website.
405	Industry Classification Benchmark	http://www.icbenchmark.com/	The Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB) is a definitive system categorizing over 70,000 companies and 75,000 securities worldwide, enabling the comparison of companies across four levels of classification and national boundaries. The ICB system is supported by the ICB Database, an unrivalled data source for global sector analysis, which is maintained by FTSE Group. 10 industries, 19 supersectors, 41 sectors, 114 subsectors.
406	European Socio-economic Classification	https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/archives/esec	The European Socio-economic Classification (ESeC) is an occupationally based classification but has rules to provide coverage of the whole adult population. The information required to create ESeC is: * occupation coded to the minor groups (i.e. 3-digit groups) of the International Standard Classification of Occupations 1988 (ISCO88 (COM)) * details of employment status, i.e. whether an employer, self-employed or employee; * number of employees at the workplace * whether a worker is a supervisor.
407	International Classification for Nursing Practice	http://www.icn.ch/what-we-do/international-classification-for-nursing-practice-icnpr/	The ICNP® is a unified nursing language system. It is a compositional terminology for nursing practice that facilitates the development of and the cross-mapping among local terms and existing terminologies.
408	International Classification of Headache Disorders	http://ihs-classification.org/	This classification is hierarchical and you must decide how detailed you want to make your diagnosis. This can range from the first-digit level to the fourth. First one gets a rough idea about which group the patient belongs to. Is it for example 1. Migraine or 2. Tension-type headache or 3. Cluster headache and other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias? Then one obtains information allowing a more detailed diagnosis. The desired detail depends on the purpose. In general practice only the first- or second-digit diagnoses are usually applied whilst in specialist practice and headache centres a diagnosis at the third- or fourth-digit levels is appropriate.

At the conference of the Euro-Med Water Directors (Rome, Nov. 2005), it was decided to open EMWIS to the Mediterranean countries not signatories of the Barcelona Declaration, i.e. Balkan countries and Libya.
412	Health Canada Controlled Subject Vocabulary	http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/home-accueil/search-recherche/hccv-vcsc-intro-eng.php	The Health Canada Controlled Subject Vocabulary was developed to provide subject access to Health Canada's information resources. The Controlled Vocabulary is a bilingual, structured, indexing and information retrieval tool for both publishers and users of the documents and information published on the Health Canada Web site. The terms listed in the controlled vocabulary are used in the Dublin Core metadata record for the SUBJECT element, where appropriate and feasible, in order to provide accurate and comprehensive results when searching the Health Canada Web site. The Health Canada Controlled Subject Vocabulary ('gchccv') has been registered with Library and Archives Canada for this purpose. The scope of the Controlled Vocabulary is dynamic and reflects subjects that have been addressed at one time or another in Health Canada sources. Terms were selected from the Government of Canada's Core Subject thesaurus and various Health Canada products, including publications, databases and related sources. The following types of concepts have been excluded from the Controlled Vocabulary: geographical names, titles (e.g., of programs), proper names (e.g., of companies) and acronyms, except where they are in common usage. The Controlled Vocabulary is a set of preferred terms that can be used to catalogue documents. It standardizes the words associated with a given subject matter, allowing for more precise searches and preventing ambiguous database indexing.
413	Radiation Chemistry Data Center Thesaurus	http://kinetics.nist.gov/solution/	The indexing terms listed in the thesaurus are those found in the RCDC Bibliographic Data Base and therefore are the terms used to generate the keyword index in this volume. The keywords are arranged alphabetically. Numbers, dashes, parentheses and super- and sub-scripts are ignored in ordering the terms except when required to distinguish two terms. Thus, '1-propanol' precedes '2-propanol' (following 'propane') and 'H2O+' precedes 'H2O-' and 'H2O2+' (all three precede 'hole'). Arrangement is word by word, thus 'hole traps' precedes 'holes'. The name of any element may be used as a keyword, but the names have been omitted from the listing. In addition, the following terms may be used: 1. 'element name' followed by a one- to three-digit number, specifying a nuclide, e.g. cobalt-60. 2. 'element name' followed by 'ions', e.g. vanadium ions. 3. 'element name' followed by 'compounds', e.g. nickel compounds. 4. 'element name' followed by 'atoms', e.g., oxygen atoms. None of the terms represented by 1 through 4 appear in the thesaurus with the exception of several in group 3 for which narrower terms have neen designated as keywords. Another exception occurs in the indexing of halogen, nitrogen and sulfur compounds; element symbols rather than element names have been used (Br, Cl, F, I, N, S) and the keywords appear as Br compounds, organic and Br compounds, inorganic, etc. Keywords which are the names of specific compounds or classes of compounds are used to define the primary subject of the investigation (or reactant). Products are indexed only by terms such as 'hydrogen formation', 'alkane formation', etc. The addition of -a or -s to a chemical name indicates that the compound was used as an additive or solvent, respectively. Thus, the keyword index may contain 'ethanol-s' as well as 'ethanol'. Each keyword entry contains a listing of broader (BT), narrower (NT) and related (RT) terms, as well as synonyms (see the USE and USED FOR (UF) terms). The narrower terms are always used when applicable, so to find all information on a particular keyword the narrower terms should also be consulted. This thesaurus was developed as a guide for the indexer and has been published to aid the users of the information services provided by the Radiation Chemistry Data Center.
414	U.S. Geological Survey Thesaurus	https://www2.usgs.gov/science/about/	The USGS Thesaurus is the principal controlled vocabulary supporting Science Topics. It is designed as a formal thesaurus conforming to ANSI/NISO Z39.19, with rigid adherence to the hierarchical (BT, NT) term relationships, generic non-hierarchical (RT) relationships, and lead-in term relationships linking non-preferred terms to descriptors either singly (UF) or in a compound USE-WITH relationship. The thesaurus is faceted, meaning its top terms delineate general aspects of information resources: Sciences: Major educational fields, fields of study, and professional groupings within USGS. Methods: Techniques, methods, procedures, or strategies for research, management, collection, or analysis of scientific information in USGS Topics: Themes, subjects, and concerns for which USGS information resources are relevant Product types: General representation of the information in a resource, such as a map or data set Time periods: Geologic time periods and seasons of the year USGS: Activities, processes, and organizational concepts relevant to USGS itself The thesaurus is limited in depth and specificity of coverage. It does not attempt to replicate existing controlled vocabularies such as GeoRef. The intention is to provide sufficient contextual cues for the information seeker to determine the relevance of a resource for his or her concern, not to locate precisely the answer to a specific user question. Each information resource in the Science Topics catalog is categorized using several index terms. Consequently a document will be listed under each category for which it would be considered a relevant resource. Approximately 1200 web resources are listed in the catalog.
415	Emtree		Comprehensive and polyhierarchically structured, Emtree provides a consistent description of all biomedical terminology, allowing unrivaled drug and disease indexing.

The Thesaurus is laid out in two columns; the left column contains the look-up term and the right column either contains the higher terms of a keyword, the generic name of a proprietary drug name, or refers the seacher to the correct term or alternative terms to use. Higher terms associated with specific keywords are indicated by the abbreviation h.t. and are found in the right column of the Thesaurus. Whenever the specific keyword appears in the database, the corresponding higher terms also appear and can be searched instead of the specific term if a broader search is required. The abbreviation ‘s.a.’ (see also) is used to indicate a related term which may be worth considering in a search. This Thesaurus is designed to facilitate searching of the Derwent Drug File.

446	International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health	http://www.who.int/classifications/icf/	The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, known more commonly as ICF, is a classification of health and health-related domains. These domains are classified from body, individual and societal perspectives by means of two lists: a list of body functions and structure, and a list of domains of activity and participation. Since an individual's functioning and disability occurs in a context, the ICF also includes a list of environmental factors. The ICF is WHO's framework for measuring health and disability at both individual and population levels. The ICF was officially endorsed by all 191 WHO Member States in the Fifty-fourth World Health Assembly on 22 May 2001 (resolution WHA 54.21). Unlike its predecessor, which was endorsed for field trail purposes only, the ICF was endorsed for use in Member States as the international standard to describe and measure health and disability. The ICF puts the notions of 'health' and 'disability' in a new light. It acknowledges that every human being can experience a decrement in health and thereby experience some degree of disability. Disability is not something that only happens to a minority of humanity. The ICF thus 'mainstreams' the experience of disability and recognises it as a universal human experience. By shifting the focus from cause to impact it places all health conditions on an equal footing allowing them to be compared using a common metric - the ruler of health and disability. Furthermore ICF takes into account the social aspects of disability and does not see disability only as a 'medical' or 'biological' dysfunction. By including Contextual Factors, in which environmental factors are listed ICF allows to records the impact of the environment on the person's functioning.
448	Global InVitro Diagnostic Classification	https://www.dimdi.de/dynamic/de/medizinprodukte/bezeichnungssysteme/edma-ivd-classification/	An effective product classification system is critical to the functioning of any industry in the knowledge-based markets of today. A classification scheme assigns a code to each product type or class, allowing quick identification of the product in a language-independent fashion (the specific name of the product is actually not mentioned).

459	Iconclass	http://www.iconclass.org/	Iconclass is a subject-specific classification system. It is a hierarchically ordered collection of definitions of objects, people, events and abstract ideas that serve as the subject of an image. Art historians, researchers and curators use it to describe, classify and examine the subject of images represented in various media such as paintings, drawings and photographs. Numerous institutions across the world use Iconclass to describe and classify their collections in a standardized manner. In turn, users ranging from art historians to museum visitors use Iconclass to search and retrieve images from these collections. And as a research tool, Iconclass is also used to identify the significance of entire scenes or individual elements represented within an image. ICONCLASS applications used around the world have made it the most widely accepted classification system for visual documents. The three main components of Iconclass are: Classification System: 28,000 hierarchically ordered definitions divided into ten main divisions. Each definition consists of an alphanumeric classification code (notation) and the description of the iconographic subject (textual correlate). The definitions are used to index, catalogue and describe the subjects of images represented in works of art, reproductions, photographs and other sources. Alphabetical Index: 14,000 keywords used for locating the notation and its textual correlate needed to describe and/or index an image. Bibliography: 40,000 references to books and articles of iconographical interest (not yet online).

468	Social History and Industrial Classification	http://www.shcg.org.uk/About-SHIC	SHIC is a subject classification widely used by UK museums. It was created nearly 20 years ago by the SHIC Working Party which continues to develop it today. The first published edition appeared in 1983 and a revised second edition was published in 1993 with further updates in 1996. The Social History and Industrial Classification (SHIC) is designed to make links between a wide variety of museum material - objects, photographs, archival material, tape recordings, information files - according to the sphere of human activity with which they are primarily associated. The aim of the Classification is to make relationships between objects, etc. via their context. A carpenter's hammer, for example, is used with other carpenter's tools, and is therefore classified alongside those related items.
469	U.S. Geological Survey Library Classification System	http://pubs.usgs.gov/bul/b2010/	The U.S. Geological Survey Library classification system has been designed for earth science libraries. It is a tool for assigning call numbers to earth science and allied pure science materials in order to collect these materials into related subject groups on the library shelves and arrange them alphabetically by author and title. The classification can be used as a retrieval system to access materials through the subject and geographic numbers. The classification scheme has been developed over the years since 1904 to meet the ever-changing needs of increased specialization and the development of new areas of research in the earth sciences. The purpose of this publication is to provide the earth science community with a classification and retrieval system for earth science materials, to offer sufficient explanation of its structure and use, and to enable library staff and clientele to classify or access research materials in a library collection.

470	Thesaurus of Occupational Therapy Subject Headings		The thesaurus of occupational therapy subject headings is a reference guide for use with OT SEARCH, an online bibliographic database which indexes the holdings of the Wilma L. West Library. This compilation consists of a controlled vocabulary based on the National Library of Medicine’s Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). OT Search users will find this tool useful in performing compact and efficient search strategies. In comparison to a broad keyword search, a search strategy utilizing valid subject headings will generate the most pertinent references related to a particular topic. It is, therefore, advisable to select appropriate terms from the thesaurus before performing your search in OT SEARCH. This thesaurus comprises two major sections: I. Alphabetical Subject Listing: A listing of all the subject terms in alphabetical order. Each entry consists of a hierarchical tree number, a note and annotation when appropriate, and a definition of the term proper. While approved subject headings are printed in capital letters (e.g. SENSORY INTEGRATIVE DYSFUNCTION), related terms are printed in lower case (e.g. Early intervention programs), with a reference to the approved subject headings (e.g. Tactile Defensiveness, use SENSORY INTEGRATIVE DYSFUNCTION). In some cases, the searcher is directed to related terms by a 'see also' reference (e.g. NURSING HOMES, see also HOMES FOR THE AGED). Some subject headings are inverted for focus purposes (e.g. health insurance is listed in the thesaurus as INSURANCE, HEALTH). II. Hierarchical Classification Scheme: A listing of tree numbers in hierarchical order. Each term is assigned a unique alphanumeric number which places it in an hierarchical classification scheme or 'tree' with a broader, narrower, or related term. The hierarchical classification scheme consists of a number of tables which classify the subject headings into several categorical layers. The major categories cover broader concepts such as anatomy, diseases, chemicals and drugs, procedures and techniques, equipment and supplies, behavior and behavior mechanisms, biological sciences, physical sciences, social sciences, technology, humanities, information sciences, persons, health care and geographic names. These categories are further broken into a strata of categories. Each table consists of an array of tree numbers and matching subject headings which are indented according to their hierarchical structure. A hyphen [-] is used to represent the status of the terms in the hierarchical scheme. The more indented the term is, the narrower in scope.
471	Broad System of Ordering	http://www.ucl.ac.uk/fatks/bso/	The primary purpose for which BSO has been compiled is to serve as an exchange or switching language for use in an information network covering all subjects and in principle extending to users anywhere in the world.
472	Integrative Levels Classification	http://www.iskoi.org/ilc/	The Integrative Levels Classification (ILC) is a knowledge organization system featuring experimental innovations. Although drawing from the heritage of bibliographic classifications, it is different from most of them in allowing to represent any combination of concepts without the ties of traditional disciplines. Phenomena of the world are listed in the ILC schedule according to the natural sequence of integrative levels; each concept can then be freely combined with others by meaningful relationships (facets). This makes ILC suitable to order and connect knowledge in a variety of media, including directories, websites, encyclopedias, audio-visual archives, printed collections, museum specimens, etc. The expressivity of its notation makes it especially fit to be integrated in computer-based automation to produce clever search and dynamic displays of knowledge items. ILC is being developed progressively since 2004. A first stable edition (ILC 1) is available for those interested in testing or using it. This includes 7052 classes (concepts) covering the whole spectrum of knowledge broadly, plus deeper specificity in certain domains (e.g. cetaceans, countries, ...) that have already been worked out in detail. The combination mechanisms allow to use the existing classes to generate meanings that approximate well enough the contents of most general collections. A special feature (deictics) is also available to define extensions fitting your local needs in ways compatible with the general system. The ILC research project takes its theoretical and technical foundations from the work developed in the 1960s by the Classification Research Group (CRG) in London, particularly in the persons of Douglas J. Foskett and Derek Austin, under a NATO grant. At the time this did not produce a finished system for contingent reasons, but it did leave us with a precious heritage of advanced techniques (freely faceted classification) that are now being implemented in ILC. The system is currently developed and managed by an international team led by Claudio Gnoli and including researchers, librarians, computer scientists, and philosophers.
473	Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme	http://publish.aps.org/PACS	The Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme® (PACS) was developed by the American Institute of Physics (AIP) and has been used in Physical Review since 1975 to identify fields and sub-fields of physics. It is used in a variety of ways, for example, in the online journals as a tool in searching for articles by subject. PACS is arranged hierarchically, by subdivision of the whole spectrum of subject matter in physics- and astronomy-related sciences into segments and then repeating the process of subdivision down to four levels. The latest edition of PACS is the 2010 edition.
474	Mathematics Subject Classification	http://msc2010.org/mscwork/	"The Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC2010) is the previous version of the MSC2020.

""The Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC) underwent a general revision, with some additions and changes, and corrections of existing errors, thus creating MSC2010 as a successor to the previous MSC2000. Mathematical Reviews (MR) and Zentralblatt für Mathematik (Zbl) carefully considered all feedback and used it in preparing their joint MSC revision. The Final MSC2010 revision was made public here [http://msc2010.org/Default.html] in May 2009, and deployed in production in July 2009 by MR for MathSciNet and Zbl for zbMATH."
475	Association for Computing Machinery Computing Classification System	http://www.acm.org/about/class/	ACM's first classification system for the computing field was published in 1964. Then, in 1982, the ACM published an entirely new system. New versions based on the 1982 system followed, in 1983, 1987, 1991, and 1998. The 2012 scheme utilizes a new poly-hierarchical structure and a more in-depth approach than the 1998 version. It no longer uses the letter-and-number coding of the previous versions. The old scheme has been mapped to the new, and both the 1998 and 2012 terms are available on Citation Pages of all indexed articles in the ACM Digital Library. The 2012 ACM Computing Classification System has been developed as a poly-hierarchical ontology that can be utilized in semantic web applications. It replaces the traditional 1998 version of the ACM Computing Classification System (CCS), which has served as the de facto standard classification system for the computing field. It is being integrated into the search capabilities and visual topic displays of the ACM Digital Library. It relies on a semantic vocabulary as the single source of categories and concepts that reflect the state of the art of the computing discipline and is receptive to structural change as it evolves in the future. ACM will a provide tools to facilitate the application of 2012 CCS categories to forthcoming papers and a process to ensure that the CCS stays current and relevant. The new classification system will play a key role in the development of a people search interface in the ACM Digital Library to supplement its current traditional bibliographic search.
476	North American Industry Classification System	http://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/	The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is the standard used by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and publishing statistical data related to the U.S. business economy. NAICS was developed under the auspices of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and adopted in 1997 to replace the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system. It was developed jointly by the U.S. Economic Classification Policy Committee (ECPC), Statistics Canada, and Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia, to allow for a high level of comparability in business statistics among the North American countries.

478	National Land Cover Data Classification Schemes	http://www.epa.gov/mrlc/classification.html	NLCD 1992 was a success, and its success had a lot to do with building the momentum for NLCD 2001. NLCD 2001 improves upon NLCD 1992 in three important ways. Whereas NLCD 1992 was simply a land-cover data set, NLCD 2001 is a land-cover database comprised of three elements: land cover, impervious surface and canopy density. Second, NLCD 2001 used improved classification algorithms, which have resulted in data with more precise rendering of spatial boundaries between the 16 classes (an additional nine classes are available in coastal areas and another four classes in Alaska only). Third, NLCD 2001 also includes Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. NLCD 1992 was restricted to the conterminous United States.
479	A Classification of the Bird Species of South America	http://www.museum.lsu.edu/~Remsen/SACCWordFiles/SACCBaseline01.html	The South American Classification Committee is an official committee of the American Ornithologists' Union whose mission is to create a standard classification, with English names, for the bird species of South America. This classification is subject to constant revision by the proposal system to allow incorporation of new data. The SACC hopes to have this classification published as a printed document within a year or so. The starting point for the classification was a pre-publication draft of Dickinson (2003); the published version differed in a few minor ways from the version used for the starting point (as noted in the Notes sections below). The classification herein consists mainly of the ranks Order, Family, Genus, and Species. Most traditional subfamilies are omitted unless supported by multiple independent data sets that mark major, deep branches within a family. Subspecies are omitted for now; a future edition will also include the Subspecies rank as designating diagnosable populations (equivalent to phylogenetic species sensu Cracraft) within taxa accorded species rank, as well as synopses of distribution. We recognize the importance of this level of classification for many kinds of analyses but are unable to provide a comprehensive evaluation of which currently recognized subspecies represent valid taxonomic units in terms of diagnosability. See Dickinson (2003) for a preliminary assessment of valid subspecies of South American birds, as well as various volumes of the Handbook of the Birds of World (Lynx Edicions, Barcelona). The region covered by the list is: (1) continental South America and all islands within 1200 km of its shores eastward into the Atlantic and westward into the Pacific oceans (including Malpelo, the Galapagos islands, San Felix and San Ambrosio, the Juan Fernandez islands, Fernando de Noronha, Trindade, Martin Vaz, São Pedro and São Paulo Archipelago, and the Falklands/Malvinas); (2) islands in the Caribbean Sea close to South America and not covered by the AOU Checklist (including Netherlands Antilles, Trinidad and Tobago); and (3) waters within 200 nautical miles of the coasts of these land areas, including the islands. A species is included on the list if the evidence for its occurrence in the area is supported by tangible evidence that is available for verification, namely a museum specimen or an archived or published photograph, videotape, or sound recording. The main list currently includes 3,330 species (3094 native breeding species, 1 of which is extinct; 147 nonbreeding residents; 75 vagrants; 14 established, introduced species). Of these, 103 newly discovered species have been described since the publication of Meyer de Schauensee's (1970) classic compilation of the species of birds of South America (i.e., at a rate of 2.5 species per year). Species whose presence is supported only by sight records, or by unpublished or non-archived tangible evidence, are placed on the Hypothetical List.

These Classification Schemes are still being developed and tested and not all of them have been implemented in this version of the IUCN Red List.
482	U.S. National Vegetation Classification	http://usnvc.org/	Classifying vegetation is a critical to sound ecological science and efficient land assessment, management and planning. The National Vegetation Classification (NVC) is a central organizing framework for how all vegetation in the United States is inventoried and studied, from broad scale formations (biomes) to fine-scale plant communities. The purpose of the NVC is to produce uniform statistics about vegetation resources across the nation, based on vegetation data gathered at local, regional, or national levels. The latest classification standard was published in 2008 by the Federal Geographic Data Committee and provides the basis for ongoing refinement of the NVC. We invite your participation in this dynamic process and hope you will make use of the considerable resources of this web portal.
483	Transporter Classification System	http://www.tcdb.org/	The TC-DB website details a comprehensive classification system for membrane transport proteins known as the Transport Classification (TC) system. The TC system is analogous to the Enzyme Commission (EC) system for classification of enzymes, except that it incorporates both functional and phylogenetic information. Descriptions, TC numbers, and examples of over 600 families of transport proteins are provided. Transport systems are classified on the basis of five criteria, and each of these criteria corresponds to one of the five numbers or letters within the TC# for a particular type of transporter. Thus a TC# normally has five components as follows: V.W.X.Y.Z. V (a number) corresponds to the transporter class (i.e., channel, carrier (porter), primary active transporter or group translocator); W (a lettter) corresponds to the transporter subclass which in the case of primary active transporters refers to the energy source used to drive transport; X (a number) corresponds to the transporter family (sometimes actually a superfamily); Y (a number) corresponds to the subfamily in which a transporter is found, and Z corresponds to the substrate or range of substrates transported. Any two transport systems in the same subfamily of a transporter family that transport the same substrate(s) are given the same TC#, regardless of whether they are orthologues (e.g., arose in distinct organisms by speciation) or paralogues (e.g., arose within a single organism by gene duplication). Sequenced homologues of unknown function are not normally assigned a TC# unless they represent a unique (sub)family or are from an unrepresented organismal kingdom. If multiple dissimilar subunits are present, they are numbered S1, S2, S3...Sn. Classification categories 8 and 9 are reserved for accessory transport proteins and incompletely characterized (families of) transporters, respectively. Mechanisms of bulk transport via endocytosis, exocytosis and intracellular trafficking, observed in eukaryotes and prokaryotes (Lonhienne et al., 2010) are not included in TCDB.
484	Classification of economic activities	https://www.destatis.de/DE/Publikationen/Verzeichnis/KlassifikationWZ08.html	The European Classification of Economic Activity (NACE) is designed to provide a uniform statistical recording of the economic activities of enterprises, establishments and other statistical units in the European Union, which is based on a classification of the economic sectors (WZ) The new system was created with the intensive participation of data users and data producers in the economy, research, administration and society in order to meet the changing requirements and requirements. As a result, a hierarchically structured economic classification with 21 sections, 88 departments, 272 groups, 615 classes and 839 subclasses was created.

Additionally, you may download an xml file of JEL Codes. JEL Codes are 3-digit, but EconLit searches require the use the four digit codes consisting of the 3-digit JEL code plus a 0. The EconLit subject descriptors are the same as the Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) classification codes.
486	Library of Congress Classification	http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcc.html	The Library of Congress Classification (LCC) is a classification system that was first developed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to organize and arrange the book collections of the Library of Congress. Over the course of the twentieth century, the system was adopted for use by other libraries as well, especially large academic libraries in the United States. It is currently one of the most widely used library classification systems in the world. The Library's Cataloging Policy and Support Office maintains and develops the system, posting weekly lists of updates on its Web site. The system divides all knowledge into twenty-one basic classes, each identified by a single letter of the alphabet. Most of these alphabetical classes are further divided into more specific subclasses, identified by two-letter, or occasionally three-letter, combinations. For example, class N, Art, has subclasses NA, Architecture; NB, Sculpture, ND, Painting; as well as several other subclasses. Each subclass includes a loosely hierarchical arrangement of the topics pertinent to the subclass, going from the general to the more specific. Individual topics are often broken down by specific places, time periods, or bibliographic forms (such as periodicals, biographies, etc.). Each topic (often referred to as a caption) is assigned a single number or a span of numbers. Whole numbers used in LCC may range from one to four digits in length, and may be further extended by the use of decimal numbers. Some subtopics appear in alphabetical, rather than hierarchical, lists and are represented by decimal numbers that combine a letter of the alphabet with a numeral , e.g. .B72 or .K535. Relationships among topics in LCC are shown not by the numbers that are assigned to them, but by indenting subtopics under the larger topics that they are a part of, much like an outline. In this respect, it is different from more strictly hierarchical classification systems, such as the Dewey Decimal Classification, where hierarchical relationships among topics are shown by numbers that can be continuously subdivided.

49	FISH Archaeological Objects Thesaurus	http://www.heritagedata.org/blog/vocabularies-provided/	Physical evidence, usually portable, resulting from past human activity or environmental remains that can be recovered from archaeological fieldwork. English Heritage takes a leading role in setting standards for recording the built and buried heritage. By setting standards that can be adopted by everyone, we can make sure that all records are consistent. In other words, if everyone uses the same words to describe the same monument, archaeological object, building material, etc, then anyone using this common language can easily index, retrieve and understand these records. With this aim in mind, English Heritage is continually developing new thesauri to provide structure and guidelines for the standardisation of terms to be used when creating new records of the past. Now, in our drive to disseminate these standards and promote their wider use, we are making available seven separate online thesauri. A tailor-made suite of programs has been developed, which uses a database to create a series of web pages for any chosen thesaurus. These can be easily accessed using a frames-capable browser and regularly updated as new terms are submitted and approved by our Data Standards Unit. National cultural heritage thesauri and vocabularies have acted as standards for use by both national organizations and local authority Historic Environment Records but until now have lacked the persistent Linked Open Data (LOD) URIs that would allow them to act as vocabulary hubs for the Web of Data. The AHRC funded SENESCHAL project aims to make such vocabularies available online as Semantic Web resources. SENESCHAL will start with major vocabularies as exemplars and project partners will continue to make other vocabularies available. Other organizations are welcome to make use of the data and services which will be open licensed. RESTful web services will be developed for the project to make the vocabulary resources programmatically accessible and searchable. These will include the provision to ‘feed back’ new terms (concepts) suggested by users.

492	Australian and New Zealand Standard Offence Classification	http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1234.0	The third edition of the Australian and New Zealand Standard Offence Classification (ANZSOC) has been developed for use within Australia and in New Zealand for the production and analysis of crime and justice statistics. It replaces the second edition of the Australian Standard Offence Classification (ASOC) and incorporates a title change from ASOC to ANZSOC and corrects some minor typographical errors only. The classification content and structure, which was updated in the second edition of ASOC following a review of the first edition of ASOC released in 1997, remains unchanged. The revised title ANZSOC reflects the international use of the framework to classify criminal behaviour and highlights the collaborative work occurring between Australia and New Zealand. The title change from ASOC to ANZSOC is also in accordance with the agreed policy between the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and Statistics New Zealand to harmonise classifications where possible. The objective of the ANZSOC is to provide a uniform national statistical framework for classifying criminal behaviour in the production and analysis of crime and justice statistics. The ANZSOC is used in Australian Bureau of Statistics statistical collections, Statistics New Zealand statistical collections, Australian police, criminal courts and corrective services agencies and New Zealand police and justice agencies.

496	Universal Decimal Classification	https://udc-hub.com/	The Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) is the world's foremost multilingual classification scheme for all fields of knowledge, a sophisticated indexing and retrieval tool. It was adapted by Paul Otlet and Nobel Prizewinner Henri La Fontaine from the Decimal Classification of Melvil Dewey, and first published (in French) between 1904 and 1907. Since then, it has been extensively revised and developed, and has become a highly flexible and effective system for organizing bibliographic records for all kinds of information in any medium (it is well suited to multi-media information collections). It is structured in such a way that new developments and new fields of knowledge can be readily incorporated. The code itself is independent of any particular language or script (consisting of arabic numerals and common punctuation marks), and the accompanying class descriptions have appeared in many translated versions. UDC is in worldwide use, and has been published in whole or in part in 40 different languages. The Multilingual Universal Decimal Classification Summary - UDC Summary (udcS) for short - represents a selection of around 2,600 classes extracted from the UDC Master Reference File (UDC MRF) 2011 which contains over 70,000 classes. The selection comprises main numbers, common auxiliary numbers and special auxiliary numbers and it represents even coverage of all areas of knowledge as contained by the scheme. UDC is updated annually and UDC Summary represents always the latest version of UDC. The UDC Summary is held in a multilingual database that mirrors the structure of the UDC MRF database and in that respect represents the full set of data and can be used as a UDC demonstrator for training, research, various information organization and retrieval purposes.
497	Thesaurus for farm equipment, field orders - Agricultural transport - Utility tools (woodworking)	https://museumsvokabular.de/node/6	Scope: 4 main groups with subdivision up to the 5th hierarchical level.
498	SnowTerm Thesaurus		The project purpose is to develop and maintain a reference structured terminology in the domain of the cryosphere environment. The identification of the potential sources of terminology was carried out with the assistance of experts of the Arabba Avalanche Centre. The result consists of a certain number of lists of terms, usually contained in glossaries where they are supplied with one or more definitions and scarcely organised within a structure. In certain cases they are clustered in thematic areas. The terms of these lists were selected according to their pertinence and relevance. At present we are working on a database of around 3.700 terms. The thematic areas, covered at present, deal with snow and ice physics, snow and ice morphology, snow and ice radiometry, remote sensing and GIS in cryosphere environment, sea ice, avalanches and glaciers. Concerning the vertical structure we adopted the Classification Scheme already in use for the development of the EARTh Thesaurus. The hierarchical setup is based on facets; according to its intrinsic features, the structure can be used as a semantic reference system, stable and partially independent from the context. Since the facet structure tends to scatter the terms under the more general referral category, we are implementing a thematic structure that will cluster the terms in themes representing specific sectors. The possibility of applying different thematic schemes allows the exploration of concepts according to different perspectives, which is able to emphasize particular and contingent aspects.
499	Earth Observation Thesaurus		The project aims at developing a controlled and structured terminology system related to GIS and remote sensing. The first phase corresponds to the identification of potential sources of terminology, the selection of proper terms, their extraction and the creation of a terminology database. Terms have been classified according to the EARTh upper structure. The semantic classification foresees the allocation of each term in a relation tree starting from the more general concept represented by the category. The result is a terminology system containing about 3.500 terms. The system can be considered as a prototype of domain semantic map, open to future integrations and updating. The use of the system by a user community would allow a better management of information and ease the information and data sharing, due both to the use of a common language and to the better semantic comprehension of data.

500	Environmental Applications Reference Thesaurus		The EARTh terminological content is derived form various multilingual and monolingual sources of controlled environmental terminology: GEMET - GEneral Multilingual Environmental Thesaurus; The UNEP-Infoterra EnVoc thesaurus; the Italian Earth Sciences Thesaurus; EnvDev, the Terminological Bulletin for the Rio de Janeiro Conference on Environment and Development, plus other documents concerning specific sectors. The selection, as well as the semantic and morphological processing of this terminology, is still in progress, and requires the management of problems connected with the utilization of multiple sources, developed in different operational fields and characterized by different approaches, concerning conceptual structuring and terminological representation. The thesaurus is constantly updated. At present it contains about 14.500 terms (...).
501	Classification of therapeutic services in medical rehabilitation	http://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/Allgemein/de/Inhalt/5_Services/03_broschueren_und_mehr/01_broschueren/01_national/KTL.html	The classification of therapeutic services (CTD) in medical rehabilitation has been a tried and tested instrument for the documentation of the therapeutic services in the rehabilitation discharge reports since 1997. It contributes significantly to the quality assurance of the medical rehabilitation of the pension insurance as well as to the further development of the rehabilitative care practices Rehabilitation guidelines that provide recommendations for the treatment of therapies for defined patient groups.
502	Process Classification Framework	http://www.apqc.org/knowledge-base/documents/apqc-process-classification-framework-pcf-cross-industry-pdf-version-600	APQC's Process Classification FrameworkSM (PCF) is a taxonomy of business processes that allows organizations to objectively track and compare their performance internally and externally with organizations from any industry. It also forms the basis for a variety of projects related to business processes. APQC's PCF was developed in the early 1990s by APQC and a group of members from a number of industries and countries throughout the world. Originally envisioned as a tool to aid in performance improvement projects, the framework evolved into the broad taxonomy that it is today. Organizations can use the PCF's common terminology to name, organize, and map their processes. It is also helpful as a tool for explaining a business in terms of horizontal processes rather than vertical functions. It is designed as a framework and global standard to be customized for use in any organization. Thus, the PCF does not list all processes within a specific organization, and every process listed in the framework does not exist in all organizations.
503	National Statistics Country Classification	http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/classifications/current-standard-classifications/national-statistics-country-classification/index.html	Country is a key variable for determining a range of social and economic statistics including country of birth, country of residence, migration, international trade and balance of payments. The National Statistics Country Classification, including the definition and coding index is designed to be the standard harmonised framework used by National Statistics' users and producers involved in the collection and processing of country-related statistical data. The National Statistics Country Classification is based on ISO 3166-1, adapted to meet data needs of United Kingdom National Statistics' users and producers.
504	International Standard Classification of Education	http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Pages/international-standard-classification-of-education.aspx	As national education systems vary in terms of structure and curricular content, it can be difficult to benchmark performance across countries over time or monitor progress towards national and international goals. In order to understand and properly interpret the inputs, processes and outcomes of education systems from a global perspective, it is vital to ensure that data are comparable. This can be done by applying the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), the standard framework used to categorise and report cross-nationally comparable education statistics. UNESCO developed the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) to facilitate comparisons of education statistics and indicators across countries on the basis of uniform and internationally agreed definitions. In 2011, a revision to ISCED was formally adopted by UNESCO Member States. The product of extensive international and regional consultations among education and statistical experts, ISCED 2011 takes into account significant changes in education systems worldwide since the last ISCED revision in 1997.

507	Virus Taxonomy	https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy	Taxonomy lies at the uneasy interface between biology and logic. The processing of information follows somewhat different rules in these two systems and the role of taxonomy is to reconcile them as tidily as possible. To this end, the Virology Division of the International Union of Microbiological Societies (IUMS) charged the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) with the task of developing, refining, and maintaining a universal virus taxonomy. The goal of this undertaking is to categorize the multitude of known viruses into a single classification scheme that reflects their evolutionary relationships, i.e. their individual phylogenies.
508	Derwent World Patents Index Classification System	http://ip-science.thomsonreuters.com/scientific/support/patents/dwpiref/reftools/classification/	Companies often use different names for the same invention, and additional variation may be introduced when the patent application is translated into different languages. Also some keywords can appear in many different contexts within patent titles. For example the word 'valve' can be either mechanical or electrical. So a subject classification system is essential for effective patent searching. DWPI categorizes patent documents using a simple classification system for all technologies. This unique classification is consistently applied to all patents by Thomson Scientific subject experts, enabling effective and precise searching in a particular area of technology. Patents are divided into three broad areas: Chemical, Engineering, and Electronic and Electrical Engineering. Each of these is then further divided into Sections and Classes which describe the technical area, or areas, covered by the patent.

510	Worldwide Bioclimatic Classification System	http://www.globalbioclimatics.org/	In the new 'Worldwide Bioclimatic Classification System' proposed, five macrobioclimates, twenty-seven bioclimates and five bioclimatic variants are recognized. The five macrobioclimates are: Tropical, Mediterranean, Temperate, Boreal and Polar. Each of them, and every one of their subordinate units or bioclimates, is represented by a characteristic group of plant formations, biocenosis and plant communities. Within almost every bioclimate, a number of variations in the seasonal rainfall patterns of rain allows us to recognize the bioclimatic variants. Additionally, within every bioclimate, variations in the thermic and ombrothermic values make it possible to distinguish the bioclimatic belts: thermotypes and ombrotypes. If macrobioclimates, bioclimates, bioclimatic variants as well as bioclimatic belts (thermo- and ombrotypes) are taken into account, about three hundred isobioclimates find territorial representation on the Earth.
511	NewsCodes	http://www.iptc.org/site/NewsCodes/View_NewsCodes/	For the news industry - but also far beyond - it is a strict requirement being able to assert something about the content of a news item, to apply so called metadata. This could be achieved either by free-text human language (e.g. by a headline or a caption) or by codes, NewsCodes. Codes have the advantage that they can be easily shared among users and as each code requires an explicit and comprehensive definition not only the codes but also their semantics can be shared among users. Further NewsCodes are language agnostic, thus the code is the same for describing content in different languages, only the definition of the code should be translated to help with understanding its semantics. As the world is only one single big object all codes could be put into a single vocabulary. But such a vocabulary can hardly be managed. For that reason the IPTC decided to split concepts of the same type into a specific controlled vocabulary. Each vocabulary has a description of its scope.
512	International Patent Classification	http://www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/en/	The International Patent Classification (IPC), established by the Strasbourg Agreement 1971, provides for a hierarchical system of language independent symbols for the classification of patents and utility models according to the different areas of technology to which they pertain. The IPC divides technology into eight sections with approximately 70,000 subdivisions. Each subdivision has a symbol consisting of Arabic numerals and letters of the Latin alphabet. The appropriate IPC symbols are indicated on each patent document, of which more than 1,000,000 were issued each year in the last 10 years. The IPC symbols are allotted by the national or regional industrial property office that publishes the patent document. For PCT documents, IPC symbols are allotted by the International Searching Authority (ISA). The Classification is indispensable for the retrieval of patent documents in the search for 'prior art.' Such retrieval is needed by patent-issuing authorities, potential inventors, research and development units, and others concerned with the application or development of technology.
513	United States Patent Classification	http://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/classification/selectnumwithtitle.htm	The USPC is a system for organizing all U.S. patent documents and many other technical documents into relatively small collections based on common subject matter. Each subject matter division in the USPC includes a major component called a class and a minor component called a subclass. A class generally delineates one technology from another. Subclasses delineate processes, structural features, and functional features of the subject matter encompassed within the scope of a class. Every class has a unique alphanumeric identifier, as do most subclasses. A class/subclass pair of identifiers uniquely identifies a subclass within a class (for example, the identifier '2/456' represents Class 2, Apparel, subclass 456, Body cover). This unique identifier is called a classification symbol, or simply a classification, or USPC classification, to distinguish it from classifications of other patent classification schemes. A subclass represents the smallest division of subject matter in the USPC under which documents may be collected.
514	Cooperative Patent Classification	http://worldwide.espacenet.com/classification?locale=en_EP	The Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) effort is a joint partnership between the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the European Patent Office (EPO) where the Offices have agreed to harmonize their existing classification systems (European Classification (ECLA) and United States Patent Classification (USPC) respectively) and migrate towards a common classification scheme.
515	Emergency Classification	http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/emerg-preparedness/about-emerg-preparedness/emerg-classification.html	An Emergency Classification is a set of plant conditions which indicate a level of risk to the public. Both nuclear power plants and research and test reactors use the four emergency classifications listed below in order of increasing severity. The vast majority of events reported to the NRC are routine in nature and do not require activation of our incident response program. Recognizing that security-related events may involve different response actions from the licensees, the NRC issued Bulletin 2005-02, Emergency Preparedness and Response Actions for Security-Based Events. This bulletin identifies minor changes to the emergency classification levels to reflect emphasis of post-9/11 conditions.
516	Biocomplexity Thesaurus	http://www.usgs.gov/core_science_systems/csas/biocomplexity_thesaurus/index.html	Development of the Biocomplexity Thesaurus began in 2002-2003 through a partnership between the former USGS NBII Program and ProQuest (formerly CSA), a worldwide information company with more than 30 years experience as a leading bibliographic database provider. The original Biocomplexity Thesaurus, first made available online in 2003, was a merger of five individual thesauri: * the CSA Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Thesaurus * the CSA Life Sciences Thesaurus * the CSA Pollution Thesaurus * the CSA Sociological Thesaurus * the CERES/NBII Thesaurus In 2004, the CSA Ecotourism Thesaurus was also merged into the Biocomplexity Thesaurus. Merging and reconciliation of the terms in these thesauri was performed by Jessica Milstead, a leading expert in the development of scientific thesauri. In 2007, USGS assumed editorial management of the Biocomplexity Thesaurus, and now leads expansion of the thesaurus, addition or modification of terms, and development of tools and services to enable the use of the Thesaurus in both CSAS and external applications. In 2008, USGS significantly expanded the Biocomplexity Thesaurus to include terminology that supports the fire ecology and management communities. More than 2,000 new concepts were added to the Thesaurus. This expansion was made possible by the very generous contributions of the following terminologies by their managing organizations: * E.V. Komarek Fire Ecology Thesaurus, Tall Timbers Research Station * Fire Effects Information System (FEIS) Glossary * Northwest and Alaska Fire Effects Clearinghouse Glossary * National Wildfire Coordinating Group Glossary of Wildland Fire Terminology * Encyclopedia of Southern Fire Science * Wildland Fire Lessons Learned Center Topics The USGS Core Science Analytics & Synthesis (CSAS) Program is committed to maintaining and expanding the Biocomplexity Thesaurus to support science informatics initiatives within USGS, and externally.

ANZSRC is the collective name for a set of three related classifications developed for use in the measurement and analysis of research and experimental development (R&D) undertaken in Australia and New Zealand. The three constituent classifications included in the ANZSRC are: Type of Activity (TOA), Fields of Research (FOR), and Socio-economic Objective (SEO). ANZSRC replaces the Australian Standard Research Classification (ASRC 1998) and introduces a new framework for measuring research and development activity in New Zealand. The use of the three constituent classifications in the ANZSRC ensures that R&D statistics collected are useful to governments, educational institutions, international organisations, scientific, professional or business organisations, business enterprises, community groups and private individuals in Australia and New Zealand.

521	Soil Taxonomy	http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/soils/survey/class/taxonomy/	The publication Keys to Soil Taxonomy serves two purposes. It provides the taxonomic keys necessary for the classification of soils in a form that can be used easily in the field. It also acquaints users of the taxonomic system with recent changes in the system. The eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy incorporates all changes approved since the publication of the second edition of Soil Taxonomy: A Basic System of Soil Classification for Making and Interpreting Soil Surveys (1999). One of the most significant changes in the eleventh edition is the addition of the suborders Wassents and Wassists for subaqueous Entisols and Histosols. We plan to continue issuing updated editions of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy as changes warrant new editions. Since it was first published 35 years ago, Soil Taxonomy: A Basic System of Soil Classification for Making and Interpreting Soil Surveys has been used to support soil survey efforts in many countries around the world. It has been translated into several languages. Soil scientists from many nations have contributed significantly to the development of the taxonomic system. The authors encourage the continued use of soil taxonomy internationally and look forward to future collaborations with the international soil science community so we can continue to make improvements. Through continued communication and collaboration, we hope that our efforts will eventually result in a truly universal soil classification system.
522	Digital Spectral Classification Atlas	http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Gray/frames.html	"The MK Spectral classification system was founded by W. W. Morgan and P. C. Keenan in the year 1943, with the publication of the first photographic spectral classification atlas, 'An Atlas of Stellar Spectra' (Morgan, Keenan & Kellman 1943). Since that time, the MK system has been extensively revised and refined by Morgan, Keenan and others. In the late 1970's, two important spectral atlases, summarizing the development of the MK system up until that time, were published. These atlases, the Revised MK Spectral Atlas for Stars Earlier than the Sun by Morgan, Abt & Tapscott (1978) and An Atlas of Spectra of the Cooler Stars: Types G, K, M, S and C, by Keenan & McNeil (1976), are the inspiration for this new digital spectral classification atlas. Indeed, some of the pages in this atlas are 'digitized' versions of pages from those two atlases. The MK spectral classification system is a natural, empirical system of spectral classification which uses in the classification process only the directly observable features in the spectrum. The MK system is defined by a set of standard stars, and classification on the system is carried out by the comparison of the program star with the standard stars, taking into account all of the features in the spectrum. The use of standards is vital because it maintains the autonomy of the system as well as ensuring that different observers will classify stars on the same system. When the MK system was first defined, it was based on photographic spectra in the blue-violet part of the spectrum. This was done by necessity, as photographic emulsions in the 1940's were sensitive only to blue-violet light. However, it was a fortunate choice, as the blue-violet portion of the spectrum (essentially from the Ca II K-line to Hbeta) contains a high density of astrophysically important atomic lines and molecular bands, which allow accurate classification of the star in a two-dimensional temperature, luminosity grid. Classification systems can and have been set up in the red, IR and the ultraviolet. These should remain independent of the traditional MK system, as different parts of the spectrum can sample different levels in the atmosphere of the star. The current spectral atlas should be considered an ongoing work which will likely be completed only in a number of years. The spectra in this atlas have been obtained with the Gray/Miller spectrograph on the 0.8 meter telescope of the Dark Sky Observatory, using a CCD detector. Two spectral resolutions have been used in this atlas. Most of the illustrations use spectra obtained with the 1200g/mm grating, which gives a spectral resolution of 1.8 Å/2 pixels and a spectral range of 3800 Å - 4600 Å, but some illustrations, especially those of the later-type stars (K, M, C and S) use spectra obtained with the 600g/mm grating. These have a resolution of 3.6 Å/2 pixels, and a spectral range of 3800 Å - 5600 Å. The higher resolution spectra are presented in a rectified intensity versus wavelength format, in which the spectral continuum has been normalized to unity. The 3.6 Å resolution spectra, for the most part, are presented in a flux versus wavelength format; this format provides additional information on the energy distribution of the star, and is to be preferred for the cooler stars, as these stars have essentially no continuum points in their spectra. For ease of illustration, the fluxes have been normalized to unity at one consistent point in the spectrum. Since the publication of the two most recent photographic spectral atlases mentioned in the paragraphs above, the MK system has undergone extensive revision and refinement. Important work in refining and extending the MK system to dimensions beyond the traditional two-dimensional temperature/luminosity grid has been carried out by Keenan and co-workers in the addition of abundance indices for the late-type stars, by Gray (1989), in the extension of the MK system to metal-weak F and G-type stars, by Henry, Kirkpatrick & coworkers in their careful redefinition and extension of the MK system to the M-type dwarfs and most lately the ""L-type"" stars, and by Walborn in the classification of the O-type stars. Later editions of this atlas will attempt to illustrate more fully these developments."
523	Atlas of Stellar Spectra	http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/ASS_Atlas/frames.html	The Atlas of Stellar Spectra and the accompanying outline have been prepared from the viewpoint of the practical stellar astronomer. Problems connected with the astrophysical interpretation of the spectral sequence are not touched on; as a consequence, emphasis is placed on ``ordinary'' stars. These are the stars most important statistically and the only ones suitable for large-scale investigations of galactic structure. The plan of the Atlas can be stated as follows: a) To set up a classification system as precise as possible which can be extended to stars of the eighth to twelfth magnitude with good systematic accuracy. The system should be as closely correlated with color temperature (or color equivalent) as is possible. The criteria used for classification should be those which change most smoothly with color equivalent. b) Such a system as described under (a) requires a classification according to stellar luminosity, that is, the system should be two-dimensional. We thus introduce a vertical spectral type, or luminosity class; then, for a normal star, the spectrum is uniquely located when a spectral type and a luminosity class are determined. The actual process of classification is carried out in the following manner: (1) an approximate spectral type is determined; (2) the luminosity class is determined; (3) by comparison with stars of similar luminosity an accurate spectral type is found.
524	United Nations Standard Products and Services Code	http://www.unspsc.org/	The United Nations Standard Products and Services Code® (UNSPSC®) provides an open, global multi-sector standard for efficient, accurate classification of products and services. Search the code on this website to locate commodity codes that can be used by your company. The UNSPSC offers a single global classification system that can be used for: Company-wide visibility of spend analysis, Cost-effective procurement optimization, Full exploitation of electronic commerce capabilities. The UNSPSC is a hierarchical classification with five levels. These levels allow analysis by drilling down or rolling up to analyze expenditures. Each level in the hierarchy has its own unique number.
525	Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States	http://hts.usitc.gov/	The HTS comprises a hierarchical structure for describing all goods in trade for duty, quota, and statistical purposes. This structure is based upon the international Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS), administered by the World Customs Organization in Brussels; the 4- and 6-digit HS product categories are subdivided into 8-digit unique U.S. rate lines and 10-digit non-legal statistical reporting categories.
526	National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities	http://nccs.urban.org/classification/NTEE.cfm	The National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) system is used by the IRS and NCCS to classify nonprofit organizations. It is also used by the Foundation Center to classify both grants and grant recipients (typically nonprofits or governments). NCCS and the IRS use the NTEE-CC system, described below, while the Foundation Center uses a slightly different version with more codes, as well as 'population/beneficiary' codes to indicate the type of population served and 'auspice' codes to indicate religious or governmental affiliation. The original NTEE was developed by NCCS during the 1980s with the collaboration of major nonprofit organizations. According to Russy D. Sumariwalla, one of the principal developers of the system, the use of such a system: facilitates the collection, tabulation, presentation, and analysis of data by the types of organizations and their activities; promotes uniformity and comparability in the presentation of statistical and other data collected by various public and private agencies; provides better quality information as the basis for public policy debate and decision-making for the nonprofit sector and for society at large. In the mid-1990s, the IRS decided to begin classifying new organizations using the NTEE system. The 'IRS determination specialists' - the individuals who decide whether or not an organization is eligible to receive federal tax exempt status - would classify the organizations based on descriptive data in the organizations' applications for recognition of tax-exempt status (Forms 1023 and 1024). Before beginning, they requested a simplified version of the NTEE to ease classification and to provide a better fit into the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), the new federal government economic classification system that replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes in 1999. The National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities-Core Codes (NTEE-CC) was created to meet this need. Designed by a team of experts, the NTEE-CC includes approximately two-thirds, or about 400, of the 645 categories in the original NTEE. Though the majority of the differences in the NTEE-CC are a result of collapsing lesser-used codes, improvements were also included. With its ease of use and consistent hierarchical logic, the NTEE-CC serves as the best instrument for tax-exempt status determination, NAICS linkage, and nonprofit organizational classification. Unlike the system used the Foundation Center, the NTEE-CC system eliminated the so-called Common Codes that permitted the 4th character of the NTEE to indicate if an organization primarily serve any of a dozen or so functions other than direct service. These categories include: alliances, advocacy, management and technical assistance, research, policy analysis, fundraising and other types of support for other nonprofit organizations. At the same time, the NTEE-CC system added 3-character categories - all in the 01-19 range within each major group (e.g., A01, B01, A19, B19, etc.) - for organizations that fulfilled these specialized functions.
527	Philanthropy Classification System	http://taxonomy.foundationcenter.org/	In 2012, in order to better meet the needs of the philanthropic sector, the Foundation Center began an extensive revision of our Philanthropy Classification System (PCS), reexamining both the terms included in the taxonomy and the overall structure. The goal was not to create yet another standard, but to work towards creating a more broadly adopted standard that more accurately reflects the work of the field and can serve as a more relevant tool for a 21st Century global philanthropy community. The Center consulted partner organizations, received feedback from the sector to complete the final revisions, and released the first version of the PCS in December 2014. The Center will be recoding our entire database over the next 4 months and the PCS will be reflected in our online products during the second quarter of 2015. Until that time we will continue to publish data using our prior Grants Classification System. The Philanthropy Classification System (PCS) describes the work of grantmakers, recipient organizations and the philanthropic transactions between those entities. The Center’s Classification System in based on the National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) and has been expanded over the last three decades to include the emerging work we have evidenced while capturing and indexing the work of the sector on a global scale. The facets of the PCS illuminate the work and answer the following questions about philanthropy:   Who? = Population Served   What? = Subject and Organization Type   How? = Support Strategy and Transaction Type   Where? = Geographic Area Served (geotree.foundationcenter.org) Our newly designed site lets you explore each facet of the taxonomy through the Visual Navigation tool, Quick Search, A-Z search or a hierarchy view.
529	CLICAPS Shelf Classification	http://www.clicaps.ethz.ch/topics.php	Shelf Classification for the inventory of the Chemistry Biology Pharmacy Information Center, accessible via StarTree, alphabetical lists, search and navigation in the classification. It is based on practical criteria (investigated and mediated knowledge areas, size and segmentation of the stock in the participating departments) And was developed partly in collaboration with the institutes. 1366 Descriptors, 239 Synonyms.
53	Components (EH)	http://www.heritagedata.org/blog/vocabularies-provided/	Elements of a monument relating to the built or buried heritage. English Heritage takes a leading role in setting standards for recording the built and buried heritage. By setting standards that can be adopted by everyone, we can make sure that all records are consistent. In other words, if everyone uses the same words to describe the same monument, archaeological object, building material, etc, then anyone using this common language can easily index, retrieve and understand these records. With this aim in mind, English Heritage is continually developing new thesauri to provide structure and guidelines for the standardisation of terms to be used when creating new records of the past. Now, in our drive to disseminate these standards and promote their wider use, we are making available seven separate online thesauri. A tailor-made suite of programs has been developed, which uses a database to create a series of web pages for any chosen thesaurus. These can be easily accessed using a frames-capable browser and regularly updated as new terms are submitted and approved by our Data Standards Unit. National cultural heritage thesauri and vocabularies have acted as standards for use by both national organizations and local authority Historic Environment Records but until now have lacked the persistent Linked Open Data (LOD) URIs that would allow them to act as vocabulary hubs for the Web of Data. The AHRC funded SENESCHAL project aims to make such vocabularies available online as Semantic Web resources. SENESCHAL will start with major vocabularies as exemplars and project partners will continue to make other vocabularies available. Other organizations are welcome to make use of the data and services which will be open licensed. RESTful web services will be developed for the project to make the vocabulary resources programmatically accessible and searchable. These will include the provision to ‘feed back’ new terms (concepts) suggested by users.
530	Oregon University System Human Resources Classification Specifications	http://www.ous.edu/dept/hr/classification-specs/	Human Resources, within the Finance and Administration Division, provides system-wide leadership, consultative services, and coordination of major human resources functions in cooperation with the seven public universities that comprise the Oregon University System. Human Resource performs a wide range of Chancellor's Office and system-wide responsibilities, including conducting and reporting system wide compensations and benefit survey findings, participating in system wide projects and task forces. The Human Resources department works closely with OUS leadership and Chancellor’s office department heads on CO staffing, compensation, leave administration, and employment policy. The department also disseminates collective bargaining agreement and benefits information to the campuses, and works closely with campus services for Chancellor's office benefits administration.
531	Vocabulary of Basic Terms for Cataloguing Costume	http://www.collectionslink.org.uk/assets/thesaurus_icombts/vbt00e.htm	In the naming of garments we worked always from the objects themselves and their relation to the body and not to any theory of classification which introduced other factors. The terms themselves and their grouping do not take account of special Function, but the naming has to be seen within the context of the list of basic information where function appears as a separate entry, following the name of the object. So the basic term for bathing or wedding dress alike is Dress. The lists of basic information and basic terms are now published as a guide to recording, setting out what information should be recorded from dress to lead into the many different aspects of its study and recommending a vocabulary of basic terms for identifying and recording its garments and accessories. The versions in different languages are not translations but the result of working together with common identification of the main types of garment with appropriate naming in each language.
532	Association of German Prädikatsweingüter e. V. Classification model	http://www.vdp.de/de/der-vdp/klassifikation/	The classification rules of the VDP define the quality of a wine in particular according to the terroir, the origin in connection with the quality, the maintenance of this particular terroir is the focus - and this is accompanied by the renouncement of all area, generic and simple position designations Terroir is defined by a 'magical triangle' of the first quality and character of the vineyard, the second hand of the winemaker, and the 3rd quality of the grapes, which is recognizable in the wine, and the quality of a vineyard is defined Through the soil (topographical location, climate and microclimate), and the use of appropriate grape varieties is defined as a terroir.
533	Regensburger Association Classification	http://rvk.uni-regensburg.de/	The Regensburger Verbundklassifikation (RVK) is a classification scheme for academic libraries. In the 1960s the University of Regensburg Library developed the RVK as an in-house classification scheme for its own extensive holdings on the open shelves. Since then the RVK evolved step by step into a classification which is currently developed cooperatively by a network of 130 academic libraries and institutions in Germany, Austria, Italy and Switzerland. The University of Regensburg Library maintains the RVK as a tool for the organization of knowledge with regard to its technical and organisational requirements.
534	Standard Occupational Classification	http://www.bls.gov/soc/	The 2010 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system is used by Federal statistical agencies to classify workers into occupational categories for the purpose of collecting, calculating, or disseminating data. All workers are classified into one of 840 detailed occupations according to their occupational definition. To facilitate classification, detailed occupations are combined to form 461 broad occupations, 97 minor groups, and 23 major groups. Detailed occupations in the SOC with similar job duties, and in some cases skills, education, and/or training, are grouped together.
535	Structural Classification of Proteins	http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/	SCOP contains the domains of all PDB entries available at the time of the current release's construction. For each of these entries a coordinate file is available and can be displayed via the various graphical interfaces. The sequence of each protein chain has also been extracted. The release also contains many literature references. These are structures that have been published in sufficient detail to be classified in SCOP, but where the coordinates are not yet available from PDB. Whereas PDB entries are identified by a 4 letter code starting with a digit, these literature entries have been given 4 letter codes starting with the letter s followed by 3 digits, e.g. s149. This code is arbitrary and may change between releases. Entries included in SCOP in this way tend only to be those structures that are significantly different from any structure already in PDB. In the absence of a PDB header, a pseudo header file has been constructed. These header files contain the reference; the SWISSPROT identifier for the sequence; the fragment of the sequence for which structural information exists (where known) and the domain classification of each part of this sequence fragment in SCOP. (Note that occassionally some of this information is incomplete where there was insufficient information about the sequence in the orginal reference.)
536	A Synoptical Classification of the Lamiales	http://depts.washington.edu/phylo/classifications/	Estimated # species in Lamiales = 22,000. The goal of this project is to produce a working infraordinal classification of the Lamiales to genus with information on distribution and species richness. All recognized taxa will be clades; adherence to Linnaean ranks is optional. Synonymy is very incomplete (comprehensive synonymy is not a goal of the project, but could be incorporated). Although I anticipate producing a publishable version of this classification at a future date, my near-term goal is to produce a web-accessible version, which will be available to the public and which will be updated regularly through input from systematists familiar with taxa within the Lamiales.
537	The International Classification of Non-profit Organizations	http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/13-015-x/2009000/sect13-eng.htm	Non-profit institutions in the satellite account are classified by primary area of activity according to the International Classification of Non-profit Organizations (ICNPO). It is the classification system recommended in the United Nations (UN) Handbook on Non-profit Institutions in the System of National Accounts. The ICNPO system groups organizations into 12 major activity groups, including a catch-all 'not elsewhere classified' category. These 12 major activity groups are further divided into 24 subgroups. Satellite account estimates are published at the major group level.
538	The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education	http://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/	The Carnegie Classification™ has been the leading framework for recognizing and describing institutional diversity in U.S. higher education for the past four decades. Starting in 1970, the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education developed a classification of colleges and universities to support its program of research and policy analysis. Derived from empirical data on colleges and universities, the Carnegie Classification was originally published in 1973, and subsequently updated in 1976, 1987, 1994, 2000, 2005, and 2010 to reflect changes among colleges and universities. This framework has been widely used in the study of higher education, both as a way to represent and control for institutional differences, and also in the design of research studies to ensure adequate representation of sampled institutions, students, or faculty. To ensure continuity of the classification framework and to allow comparison across years, the 2010 Classification update retains the same structure of six parallel classifications, initially adopted in 2005. They are as follows: Basic Classification (the traditional Carnegie Classification Framework), Undergraduate and Graduate Instructional Program classifications, Enrollment Profile and Undergraduate Profile classifications, and Size & Setting classification. These classifications provide different lenses through which to view U.S. colleges and universities, offering researchers greater analytic flexibility. These classifications were updated using the most recent national data available as of 2010, and collectively they depict the most current landscape of U.S. colleges and universities.
539	Community Engagement Elective Classification		The classification for Community Engagement is an elective classification, meaning it is based on voluntary participation by institutions. Whereas the Foundation's all-inclusive classifications involve secondary analysis of existing national data sources available for all institutions, elective classifications involve additional data collection and documentation, with substantial effort invested by participating institutions. Elective classifications enable the Foundation's classification system to recognize important aspects of institutional mission and action that are not represented in the national data. Because of their voluntary nature, elective classifications do not represent a comprehensive national assessment: an institution's absence from the Community Engagement classification should not be interpreted as reflecting a judgment about the institution's commitment to its community.
54	FISH Event Types Thesaurus	http://www.heritagedata.org/blog/vocabularies-provided/	A development of the ALGAO events wordlist. The thesaurus is an indexing tool to be used for recording archaeological and architectural investigative, data collection exercises; from intrusive interventions into the resource to non damaging survey events. The Event Types Thesaurus includes 128 terms. Of these, there are 83 preferred terms, 37 non-preferred terms and 8 non-index terms. The terms are divided into two classes: INTRUSIVE EVENT and NON INTRUSIVE EVENT. The former covering events that have a physical impact upon the archaeological resource and the latter covering events that record the resource but do not have a physical impact upon it. In order to ease retrieval the terms sit in hierarchies under a number of non index grouping terms, for example ARCHAEOLOGICAL INTERVENTION, ENVIRONMENTAL INTERVENTION, HERITAGE ASSESSMENT and REMOTE SENSING etc. English Heritage takes a leading role in setting standards for recording the built and buried heritage. By setting standards that can be adopted by everyone, we can make sure that all records are consistent. In other words, if everyone uses the same words to describe the same monument, archaeological object, building material, etc, then anyone using this common language can easily index, retrieve and understand these records. With this aim in mind, English Heritage is continually developing new thesauri to provide structure and guidelines for the standardisation of terms to be used when creating new records of the past.

540	National Occupational Classification	http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/noc.asp	The National Occupational Classification (NOC) 2011 provides a standardized language for describing the work performed by Canadians in the labour market. It is used for many applications including defining and collecting statistics, managing information databases, analyzing labour market trends and extracting practical career planning information. More importantly, it gives statisticians, labour market analysts, career counsellors, employers and individual job seekers a consistent way to collect data and describe and understand the nature of work. The NOC is developed in collaboration with Statistics Canada. The NOC tool classifies occupations with a four-digit code according to skill type and skill level. The digits of the NOC code reflect important information about the occupation it represents (e.g., 3113 Dentists - '31' indicates that this is a health occupation and it requires university level education). For a complete overview of the classification system, please consult the on-line NOC Training Tutorial (See related links section). The classification system also supports a variety of career information sources published by the Government of Canada and others. For example, Job Futures, the widely-used source of information about occupational outlooks, and the national JobBank®, an electronic listing of jobs, work or business opportunities provided by Canadian employers are both organized according to NOC definitions. By providing a standard way of organizing labour market information, the NOC helps all Canadians to be better informed about the world of work.

543	Advancing Clinico-Genomic Trials on Cancer Master Ontology	http://www.ifomis.org/acgt/1.0	The intention of the ACGT Master Ontology (MO) is to represent the domain of cancer research and management in a computationally tractable manner. The ACGT MO is built being maintained, using the Protégé-OWL free open-source ontology editor, Version 4. It is written in OWL-DL and presented as an .owl file. The ACGT MO is re-using Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as upper level and the OBO Relation Ontology.
544	Cell Phenotype Ontology	https://code.google.com/archive/p/cell-phenotype/	The Cell Phenotype Ontology (CPO) is an ontology to describe phenotypes on the cellular scale. It contains a rich classification of cellular component abnormalities, including links to morphological and physiological abnormalities. Based on the Gene Ontology's classification of cellular processes, CPO provides a large number of formally as well as textually defined classes to characterize process abnormalities.
545	Neglected Tropical Disease Ontology	http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~ntdo/	The Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are a set of diseases which persist in exactly the physical, psychosocial and economic situation of the poorest, most marginalized populations of the developing world. Most NTDs diseases are chronic diseases which are related to poverty as a promoter of parasitic, bacterial, and also viral or fungal infections. Although of major healthcare impact in developing and threshold countries NTDs are still seen as a rare event in developed countries. In the main target countries of Latin America, Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, the distribution of NTD is controlled by climatic conditions like Temperature (15° C and 40° C), humidity and altitude (below 2200 meters). In these regions, most of the population (around 2.7 billion people) lives on the basis of about $ 2.00 per day. This population is considered the poorest in the world, and is also listed as most vulnerable to NTDs. Among the NTDs, the vector-borne diseases (Dengue fever, Leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, American Trypanosomiasis, African Trypanosomiasis, Lymphatic Filariasis, Yellow Fever, among others) have resulted in a high level of mortality in poorer regions. These infections persist for a long time and can cause severe disability and disfigurement, resulting in fundamental economic, social and political burden. Some of these diseases affect developed countries as well. Envisioning the maintenance of health quality through health policy efforts, ontologies could play an important role in the management of information processed by health systems. If data in Clinical Information Systems and health databases would be standardized via ontologies data mining and even secondary data usage would be easier. Ontologically accessed data is integratively queryable and hence easy to compare. In particular such formalized data, if grouped, could produce new epidemiological information, to help in decision-making process. As keys challenges for infectious disease management the World Health Organization indicated an urgent need for diagnostic tools, new more effective medicines and pesticides, and the promotion of integrated vector management. A prerequisite in the fight against vector-borne diseases it has recently been recognized that efforts are needed to facilitate the access to epidemiological knowledge about these diseases in a structured way. Controlled terminologies supported by ontologies help the user to systematically use this knowledge and permit large scale automated analysis approaches like logical and rule-based machine reasoning. At this level our effort concentrates on the most important point for vector-borne disease control is the transmission path, as it drives prevention strategies and decision support. It is also important to have an integration with tools to improve health policy related outcomes.
546	Minimal Anatomy Terminology	http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray-srv/mat/	The Minimal Anatomy Terminology (MAT) is an OBO format terminology using broader-than relationships designed for annotating and searching tissue-associated data and timelines from organisms. Identifiers from >20 anatomy ontologies are mapped to each MAT term to facilitate access to and interoperability across tissue-associated data resources.
547	A Classification of Mobile Genetic Elements	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC308818/pdf/gkh084.pdf	ACLAME is a database dedicated to the collection and classification of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) from various sources, comprising all known phage genomes, plasmids and transposons. In addition to provide information on the full genomes and genetic entities, it aims at building a comprehensive classification of the functional modules of MGE's at the protein, gene, and higher levels. There are 122154 proteins found in 2326 MGEs. Total number of host is 811 (Version 0.4).
548	Mobile Genetic Element Ontology	http://aclame.ulb.ac.be/Classification/mego.html	MeGO is a Gene Ontology under construction dedicated to the functions of mobile genetic elements.

550	NanoParticle Ontology for Cancer Nanotechnology Research	http://www.nano-ontology.org/	Data generated from cancer nanotechnology research are so diverse and large in volume that it is difficult to share and efficiently use them without informatics tools. In particular, ontologies that provide a unifying knowledge framework for annotating the data are required to facilitate the semantic integration, knowledge-based searching, unambiguous interpretation, mining and inferencing of the data using informatics methods. Here, we discuss the design and development of NanoParticle Ontology (NPO), which is developed within the framework of the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), and implemented in the Ontology Web Language (OWL) using well-defined ontology design principles. The NPO is developed to represent the knowledge underlying the description, preparation, and characterization of nanomaterials in cancer nanotechnology research.
551	Neurobehavior Ontology	http://code.google.com/p/behavior-ontology/	The Neurobehavior Ontology (NBO) consists of two main components, an ontology of behavioral processes and an ontology of behavioral phenotypes. The behavioral process branch of NBO contains a classification of behavior processes complementing and extending GO’s process ontology. The behavior phenotype branch of NBO consists of a classification of both normal and abnormal behavioral characteristics of organisms. NBO’s prime application is to provide the vocabulary that is required to integrate behavior observations within and across species. It is currently being applied by several model organism communities as well as in the description of human behavior-related disease phenotypes.
552	Mental Functioning Ontology	http://code.google.com/p/mental-functioning-ontology/	The Mental Functioning Ontology is an ontology for mental functioning, including mental processes such as cognition and traits such as intelligence, and related diseases and disorders. It is developed in the context of the Ontology for General Medical Science and the Basic Formal Ontology. The project is being developed in collaboration between the University of Geneva, Switzerland, and the University at Buffalo, USA. The project is being developed with full involvement of all relevant communities, following best practices laid out by the OBO Foundry. Efforts are currently underway to align with related projects including the Behaviour Ontology, the Cognitive Atlas, the Cognitive Paradigm Ontology and the Neural Electro Magnetic Ontologies.
553	Ontology for Drug Discovery Investigations	http://code.google.com/p/ddi-ontology/	The goal of DDI project is to develop an ontology for the description of drug discovery investigations. The Pharmaceutical industry is an information based industry. The aim of DDI is to add value to the information generated in the drug pipeline by making the information easier to reuse, integrate, curate, retrieve, and reason with. DDI aims to follow to the Open Biomedical Ontologies Foundry (OBO) principles, to use relations laid down in the OBO Relation Ontology, and to be compliant with Ontology for biomedical investigations (OBI).
554	Ontology for General Medical Science	http://code.google.com/p/ogms/	The Ontology for General Medical Science (OGMS) is an ontology of entities involved in a clinical encounter. OGMS includes very general terms that are used across medical disciplines, including: 'disease', 'disorder', 'disease course', 'diagnosis', 'patient', and 'healthcare provider'. OGMS uses the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as an upper-level ontology. The scope of OGMS is restricted to humans, but many terms can be applied to a variety of organisms. OGMS provides a formal theory of disease that can be further elaborated by specific disease ontologies. This theory is implemented using OWL-DL and OBO Relation Ontology relations and is available in OWL and OBO formats.
555	Ontology of Data Mining	http://ontodm.com/	The domain of data mining (DM) deals with analyzing different types of data. The data typically used in data mining is in the format of a single table, with primitive datatypes as attributes. However, structured (complex) data, such as graphs, sequences, networks, text, image, multimedia and relational data, are receiving an increasing amount of interest in data mining. A major challenge is to treat and represent the mining of different types of structured data in a uniform fashion. A theoretical framework that unifies different data mining tasks, on different types of data can help to formalize the knowledge about the domain and provide a base for future research, unification and standardization. Next, automation and overall support of the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process is also an important challenge in the domain of data mining. A formalization of the domain of data mining is a solution that addresses these challenges. It can directly support the development of a general framework for data mining, support the representation of the process of mining structured data, and allow the representation of the complete process of knowledge discovery. We propose a reference modular ontology for the domain of data mining OntoDM, directly motivated by the need for formalization of the data mining domain. The OntoDM ontology is designed and implemented by following ontology best practices and design principles. Its distinguishing feature is that it uses Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as an upper-level ontology and a template, a set of formally defined relations from Relational Ontology (RO) and other state-of-the-art ontologies, and reuses classes and relations from the Ontology of Biomedical Investigations (OBI), the Information Artifact Ontology (IAO), and the Software Ontology (SWO). This will ensure compatibility and connections with other ontologies and allow cross-domain reasoning capabilities.
556	Ontology for Genetic Interval	https://code.google.com/p/ontology-for-genetic-interval/	"Using realistic ontology BFO as its top ontology's framwork, OGI formalized the genomic element by defining an upper class 'genetic interval'. The definition of 'genetic interval' is ""the spatial continuous physical entity which contains ordered genomic sets(DNA, RNA, Allele, Marker,etc.) between and including two points (Nucleic Acid Base Residue) that have a liner primary sequence sturcture. It is either a proper part of an chromosome or a RNA molecule or an artificial genetic interval."" The 'genetic sequence' is also formalized in OGI, the differences between 'genetic sequence' and 'genetic interval' is that, 'genetic squence' refers to a liner sequence with only primary structure, whereas 'genetic interval' refers to the 3D sequence in reality, which has not only 3D structure, but also need to have the 'genetic sequence' as its primary structure'. From this aspect we make a distinction between a modelled sequence and a real sequence object as realm."
557	International Classification of Primary Care	http://www.kith.no/templates/kith_WebPage____1062.aspx	ICPC (International Classification of Primary Care) is a clinical coding system. The first version of ICPC published in 1987 is referred to as ICPC-1. The version in the 1993 publication “The International Classification of Primary Care in the European Community: With a Multi-Language Layer” is known as ICPC-1. The second version from 1998 is referred to as ICPC-2. ICPC-2e is an electronic version from year 2000 of the revised and corrected chapters 10 and 11 of the ICPC-2 book. The full revision cycle is currently 11 years, however, mapping to other classifications may be reviewed at shorter intervals to adjust for changes in other classifications and changed usage.

56	FISH Building Materials Thesaurus	http://www.heritagedata.org/blog/vocabularies-provided/	Construction materials for monuments relating to the built and buried heritage. English Heritage takes a leading role in setting standards for recording the built and buried heritage. By setting standards that can be adopted by everyone, we can make sure that all records are consistent. In other words, if everyone uses the same words to describe the same monument, archaeological object, building material, etc, then anyone using this common language can easily index, retrieve and understand these records. With this aim in mind, English Heritage is continually developing new thesauri to provide structure and guidelines for the standardisation of terms to be used when creating new records of the past. Now, in our drive to disseminate these standards and promote their wider use, we are making available seven separate online thesauri. A tailor-made suite of programs has been developed, which uses a database to create a series of web pages for any chosen thesaurus. These can be easily accessed using a frames-capable browser and regularly updated as new terms are submitted and approved by our Data Standards Unit.  National cultural heritage thesauri and vocabularies have acted as standards for use by both national organizations and local authority Historic Environment Records but until now have lacked the persistent Linked Open Data (LOD) URIs that would allow them to act as vocabulary hubs for the Web of Data. The AHRC funded SENESCHAL project aims to make such vocabularies available online as Semantic Web resources. SENESCHAL will start with major vocabularies as exemplars and project partners will continue to make other vocabularies available. Other organizations are welcome to make use of the data and services which will be open licensed.  RESTful web services will be developed for the project to make the vocabulary resources programmatically accessible and searchable. These will include the provision to ‘feed back’ new terms (concepts) suggested by users.
560	eagle-i Research Resource Ontology	https://open.med.harvard.edu/wiki/display/eaglei/Ontology	The eagle-i research resource ontology (ERO) models research resources such as instruments, protocols, reagents, animal models and biospecimens. It has been developed in the context of the eagle-i project (http://eagle-i.net/). Currently, ERO consists of over 2100 classes of which 1200 were created within the ERO namespace, while the rest come from existent ontologies such as the Ontology for Biomedical Investigation (OBI), the uber-anatomy ontology (Uberon), VIVO, the Ontology for Clinical Research (OCRe), the Sequence Ontology (SO), the Software Ontology (SWO) and we include terms from the NCBI Taxonomy as well.
561	Emotion Ontology	https://code.google.com/archive/p/emotion-ontology/	The Swiss Centre for Affective Sciences, in collaboration with the University at Buffalo, is developing an Emotion Ontology to describe affective phenomena. This project is a branch of the broader Mental Functioning ontology effort. The Centre brings together scientists from neuroscience and psychology, together with economists, historians, philosophers as well as scholars in the humanities, in a multi-disciplinary effort to understand how affective phenomena, such as motives, attitudes, moods, and emotions, affect the individual and society. Interdisciplinary research is inherently plagued by the difficulties of integration and standardisation of terminology, knowledge and disparate theoretical frameworks in order to compare results across disciplines which historically have evolved separately. In the context of this multi-disciplinary research environment, to assist the integration and computational processing of results in the affective sciences, we are developing the Emotion Ontology to aid in disambiguation and standardised reporting of research results. The ontology will represent all relevant aspects of affective phenomena including their bearers, the different types of emotions, moods, etc., their different parts and dimensions of variation, their facial and vocal expressions, and the role of emotions and affective phenomena in general in influencing human behavior. Proper delineation of the upper levels is essential to ensure the unambiguous interpretation of the entities in the ontology which contributes to the usability and interoperability of the fully populated ontology. To achieve this, we will draw on the Basic Formal Ontology, the domain-independent upper ontology advocated by the OBO Foundry. Subsequent phases of the project will identify, define and place all relevant affective phenomena within the ontology, and link this ontology to neighbouring efforts in the domains of neural and social informatics, such as the Neuroscience Information Framework. Finally, we will develop software applications which make use of the ontology to directly support the work of Affective Science researchers both in Switzerland and globally.
562	Environment Ontology	http://www.environmentontology.org/	"The Environment Ontology (EnvO) provides a controlled, structured vocabulary that is designed to support the annotation of any organism or biological sample with environment descriptors. EnvO contains terms for biomes, environmental features, and environmental material."" EnvO enables ""a concise, standardised, and comprehensive description of environment that is key to the integration, archiving and federated searching of environmental data. As a tool for the life sciences, we see EnvO bringing benefits similar to those of the Gene Ontology (GO). Through promoting consistent annotation grounded in an ontological framework, we hope to facilitate the semantic retrieval of any biological record anchored to EnvO. Records contained in sequence databases, 'omic data repositories, tissue banks and museum collections are prime candidates for EnvO annotation. However, EnvO is also suitable for the annotation of any record that has an environmental component. For example, you can use EnvO terms to provide information on the environment of remote sensing devices or simply to tag a picture that you took at the weekend. Further, the EnvO project is closely tied with GAZ, a first step towards an open source gazetteer constructed on ontological principles. GAZ describes places and place names as well as the relations between them and, when linked with EnvO descriptors, provides a basis to infer environment from place names."
563	Crop Ontology	http://www.cropontology.org/	The Crop Ontology (CO) current objective is to compile validated concepts along with their inter-relationships on anatomy, structure and phenotype of Crops, on trait measurement and methods as well as on Germplasm with the multi-crop passport terms. The concepts of the CO are being used to curate agronomic databases and describe the data. The use of ontology terms to describe agronomic phenotypes and the accurate mapping of these descriptions into databases is important in comparative phenotypic and genotypic studies across species and gene-discovery experiments as it provides harmonized description of the data and therefore facilitates the retrieval of information. Development of crop-specific trait ontologies and the germplasm ontologies began in 2008 for chickpea, maize, Musa, potato, rice and wheat, and in 2010 for cassava. The GCP Crop Ontology is a global public good, available to be used freely by all.
564	Computational Neurosciences Ontology	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/CNO	CNO is a controlled vocabulary composed of classes representing general concepts related to computational neuroscience. These concepts are organized in a hierarchy of concepts and related to each other using logical relations. One of the main relations is the hierarchical relation named “is a” relation. Knowing the relations between classes allows us to create simple sentences such as: “a model is a thing”, “a leaky integrate-and-fire is a model”, “voltage is a elementary model component”, … The first step for CNO development was to create a list of relevant terms and concepts from textbooks and from the different expertise of the MSM Task Force members. Based on this list of terms, we developed a first version of the Computational Neuroscience Ontology (CNO), using the OWL-DL standard proposed by W3C. The core of CNO is currently (January 2013) composed of 221 terms and 2 datatype properties. As Computational Neuroscience model are very diverse, CNO is still in development to integrate the most relevant concepts for annotating as many Computational Neuroscience models as possible. However, CNO aims to be a tool for the community and therefore contribution of the community would be highly valuable to bring CNO to a more mature distribution.
565	Comparative Data Analysis Ontology	http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdao/	"CDAO stands for ""Comparative Data Analysis Ontology"", a formalization of concepts and relations relevant to evolutionary comparative analysis, such as phylogenetic trees, OTUs (operational taxonomic units) and compared characters (including molecular characters as well as other types). CDAO is being developed by scientists in biology, evolution, and computer science. In general, ontologies are designed to support formal or automated reasoning. Our aim in developing CDAO is to provide the language support for representing, and reasoning over, phylogenetic data and metadata. When CDAO is fully developed and supported by software, it will be possible for one researcher to represent information with conceptual richness, and for another research (or a computer) to access that same conceptual richness. The current version of CDAO is a kind of free-floating ontology not linked into an ""upper"" ontology. The reason for this is that, when we first began to develop CDAO, we did not understand where the concepts and relations would fit in terms of available upper ontologies. We're still not entirely sure."

570	Experimental Factor Ontology	http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/	The Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) provides a systematic description of many experimental variables available in EBI databases, and for external projects such as the NHGRI GWAS catalogue. It combines parts of several biological ontologies, such as anatomy, disease and chemical compounds. The scope of EFO is to support the annotation, analysis and visualization of data handled by the EBI Functional Genomics Team. We also add terms for external users when requested.
573	Genomic Clinical Decision Support Ontology		The Genomic Clinical Decision Support (Genomic CDS) project aims to create and maintain an integrated, ontology-based knowledge base of clinically relevant pharmacogenomic information. This knowledge base is used to implement clinical decision support algorithms for improving quality of care, e.g., for providing drug dosage recommendations and comparisons of the efficacy of different treatment options.
575	Glycomics Ontology	http://glycomics.ccrc.uga.edu/core4/informatics-ontologies.html	The Glycomics Ontology (GlycO) focuses on the glycoproteomics domain to model the structure and functions of glycans and glycoconjugates, the enzymes involved in their biosynthesis and modification, and the metabolic pathways in which they participate. GlycO is intended to provide both a schema and a sufficiently large knowledge base, which will allow classification of concepts commonly encountered in the field of glycobiology in order to facilitate automated reasoning and information analysis in this domain. The GlycO schema exploits the expressiveness of OWL-DL to place restrictions on relationships, thus making it suitable to be used as a means to classify new instance data. These logical restrictions are necessary due to the chemical nature of glycans, which have complex, branched structures that cannot be represented in any simple way. Glycans are thus distinguished from DNA (e.g., genes) and proteins, which can be represented (at least in their most basic forms) as simple character strings. The structural knowledge in GlycO is modularized, in that larger structures are semantically composed from smaller canonical building blocks. In particular, glycan instances are modeled by linking together several instances of canonical monosaccharide residues, which embody knowledge of their chemical structure (e.g., β-D-GlcpNAc) and context (e.g., attached directly to the Asn residue of a protein). This bottom-up semantic modeling of large molecular structures using smaller building blocks allows structures in GlycO to be placed in a biochemical context by describing the specific interactions of its component parts with proteins, enzymes and other biochemical entities.
577	Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology	http://www.pombase.org/browse-curation/fission-yeast-phenotype-ontology	The Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology (FYPO) is a formal ontology of phenotypes observed in fission yeast. FYPO is being developed to support the comprehensive and detailed representation of phenotypes in PomBase, the online fission yeast resource. Its scope is similar to that of the Ascomycete Phenotype Ontology (APO), but FYPO includes more detailed pre-composed terms as well as computable definitions.
578	Computer-Based Patient Record Ontology	http://code.google.com/p/cpr-ontology/	The (Computer-Based Patient Record) CPR ontology burrows its name from the Institute of Medicine term used to define medical records systems of the future and the important features that distinguish them for EHRs of today. In particular, it defines a set of requirements including a Record Content category, which states: Uniform core data elements, standardized coding systems and formats, a common data dictionary, and information on outcomes of care and functional status. The requirement of a set of uniform core elements is meant to be directly addressed by this ontology. In addition, it attempts to define a minimal set of terms that provide grounded, ontologically commitment for the representations shared between many of the healthcare information (such as HL7 RIM), process and terminological models via the use of foundational ontologies. In addition, a major influencing principle is that as far as the application of ontology for the benefit of medical informatics is concerned, a pragmatic approach is necessary - one that compromises between a purely 'realist' approach and a cognitive approach that refrains from committing to a representation of the intrinsic nature of the world. For those aspects of reality for which there is significant consensus on the underlying science and use of terminology, an ontology should try as much as possible to capture the constraints that reflect this consensus. However, where such constraints do not provide any direct benefit in the use ontology in a CPR, we should refrain from any further formalization. The general motivation is to allow ontologies to facilitate the use of computer reasoning in playing an important role in the scientific method, but at the same time protect against an excessive attempt to reduce every aspect of clinical medicine to metaphysical distinctions that do not have any legitimate benefit.
579	Cognitive Paradigm Ontology	http://www.cogpo.org/	The use of alternate and even competitive terminologies can often impede scientific discoveries. While the experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience literature may refer to certain behavioral paradigms by name (eg. the Stroop paradigm or the Sternberg paradigm) or by function (a working memory task, a visual attention task), these paradigms can vary tremendously in the stimuli that are presented to the subject, the response expected from the subject, and the instructions given to the subject. This means that an automated reasoning system using names of paradigms would not realize that data from these different experiments could be compared and used. CogPO was developed directly from the taxonomy created for the BrainMap Database. Its design concentrates on what can be observed directly: categorization of each paradigm in terms of (1) the stimulus presented to the subjects, (2) the requested instructions, and (3) the returned response. All paradigms are essentially composed of these three orthogonal components, and formalizing an ontology around them is a clear and direct approach to describing paradigms. CogPO seeks to represent stimuli, responses, and instructions that define the conditions of the experiment in a standardized format, with well-defined terms and relationships between them. CogPO is being built to be compliant with OBO Foundry principles, and uses the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as its upper level ontology.

582	Infectious Disease Ontology	https://code.google.com/p/infectious-disease-ontology/	The IDO ontologies are designed as a set of interoperable ontologies that will together provide coverage of the infectious disease domain. At the core of the set is a general Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO-Core) of entities relevant to both biomedical and clinical aspects of most infectious diseases. Sub-domain specific extensions of IDO-Core complete the set providing ontology coverage of entities relevant to specific pathogens or diseases.
583	Information Artifact Ontology	http://code.google.com/p/information-artifact-ontology/	The Information Artifact Ontology (IAO) is a new ontology of information entities, originally driven by work by the OBI digital entity and realizable information entity branch. An information artifact is, loosely, a dependent continuant or its bearer that is created as the result of one or more intentional processes. Examples: uniprot, the english language, the contents of this document or a printout of it, the temperature measurements from a weather balloon.
584	International Classification of External Causes of Injury		ICECI is a free practical tool for classifying the circumstances in which injuries occur. Thus, it can be used in surveillance and research to support injury and trauma prevention and control efforts throughout the world. Using this tool, one can code the key factors that may be involved in causing injuries. Consequently, injuries can be both counted and described to yield useful information for setting priorities, making policy decisions, and guiding prevention. Purpose/Definition: To enable classifying external causes of injuries. It is designed to help researchers and prevention practitioners to describe, measure and monitor the occurrence of injuries and to investigate their circumstances of occurrence using an internally agreed classification. Criteria underlying the classification are: a separate coding axis for each main concept, usefulness for injury prevention, useability in may types of settings (many parts of the world; emergency departments and other places where data are collected), comparability and complementarity with the ICD-10.
585	Kinetic Simulation Algorithm Ontology	http://biomodels.net/kisao/	To enable the accurate and repeatable execution of a computational simulation task, it is important to identify both the algorithm used and the initial setup. These minimum information requirements are described by the MIASE guidelines. Since the details of some algorithms are not always publicly available, and many are implemented only in a limited number of simulation tools, it is crucial to identify alternative algorithms with similar characteristics that may be used to provide comparable results in an equivalent simulation experiment. The Kinetic Simulation Algorithm Ontology (KiSAO) was developed to address this issue by describing existing algorithms and their inter-relationships through their characteristics and parameters. The use of KiSAO in conjunction with simulation descriptions, such as SED-ML, will allow simulation software to automatically choose the best algorithm available to perform a simulation and unambiguously refer to it.

656	Multiple Alignment Ontology	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1180671/	The goal of the MAO project is to develop a controlled, structured vocabulary, that will provide a common language not only for the construction of multiple alignments, but also for the numerous applications that exploit the information available in an integrated, global multiple alignment of a protein family. An important issue in the development of MAO is the interoperability with existing information sources, in order to maximise its’ applicability and utility. Therefore, links should be provided to other kinds of information, including databases such as UniProt, PDB or InterPro, as well as existing ontologies such as GO or the HUPO Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI). A vocabulary of terms is provided in the form of a hierarchical network of concepts, together with precise, explanatory definitions of each term and the inter-relations between the different concepts. The aim is to include the great majority of the concepts relevant to multiple sequence alignments, ranging from fundamental concepts such as ‘sequence’ or ‘residue’ to more complex concepts such as structural environment, functional activity or evolutionary context. The MAO is represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), in which each node stands for a concept and the links connecting the nodes represent the relationship between them. Two hierarchical relations are defined: ‘is_a’ and ‘part_of’. The nodes can also have other information attached to them in the form of names (defined by the relation ‘is_name’), annotations (defined by ‘is_annotation’) or other attributes. An attribute is generally a simple string or number variable that contains additional information about the concept.
657	COSMO Ontology	http://www.micra.com/COSMO/	The goal of the COSMO working group was to develop a foundation ontology by a collaborative process that will allow it to represent all of the basic (‘primitive’) ontology elements that all members felt were needed for their applications. Interoperability could then be achieved among ontology-based applications using the foundation ontology by creating any specialized domain ontology element as a combination of the primitive ontology elements, and when one system wishes to communicate information to others, it must transmit not only the data, but also any logical specifications of the ontology elements required to interpret the data (if they are not already in the foundation ontology or some public extension). Any system that can properly interpret the primitive elements will be able to properly interpret ontology elements created as a combination of those primitives. The development of COSMO is fully open, and any comments or suggestions from any sources are welcome. After some discussion and input from members in 2006, the development of the COSMO has been continued primarily by Patrick Cassidy, the chairman of the COSMO Working Group (no longer active).  Contributions and suggestions from any interested party are still welcome and encouraged.  Many of the types (OWL classes) in the current COSMO have been taken from the OpenCyc OWL version 0.78, and from the SUMO. Other elements were taken from other ontologies (such as BFO and DOLCE) or developed specifically for COSMO. The development of the COSMO started as a merger of basic elements from Cyc, SUMO, and DOLCE, and continued up to revision 589 (2008-02-19), at which point the names (labels) of the elements of the COSMO were compared with the words in the Longman defining vocabulary, and out of the 2201 Longman words, it was discovered that 1817 were not present as labels for COSMO elements. At this point, a systematic supplementation of the COSMO was begun, to assure that the concepts represented by the Longman vocabulary were all represented in some form in the COSMO. The new elements are being added by alphabetical inspection of the list of missing Longman words. At version 0.65 (April 2010) the COSMO had 7339 types (OWL classes), 808 relations, and 2039 restrictions, and all of the words in the Longman defining vocabulary had some correlated ontology element in the COSMO. The formal mapping of the Longman words to the ontology elements is at present (rev945) only partly complete, and is continuing. The mapping consists of a relation “xxxx” on the ontology element to the Longman word(s) that represent that element in English.

It is used in many Swedish public libraries, school libraries and research libraries. The first edition came in 1921 and was based on the classification used in the accession libraries of the scientific libraries. The system is also called"" SAB System Classification System "","" SAB System ""and"" SAB Classification System "". The abbreviation SAB stands for the"" Swedish Public Library Association. ""SAB collaborated with the Swedish Library Society (SBS) and formed the current Swedish Library Association. To keep up with the development of new subject areas. The Swedish Library Association Committee for Classification Systems for Swedish Libraries (formerly SAB's Cataloging and Classification Committee) decides on changes, corrections and application instructions to SAB's classification system. On which, for example, you specify the contents of a signature or add new topics. Sometimes there are proper audits where the entire system is being revised. The major audits usually result in a new edition of the classification system. The last eighth edition began in 2002 and was taken in autumn 2006."
673	PANTHER Classification System		The PANTHER (Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships) Classification System was designed to classify proteins (and their genes) in order to facilitate high-throughput analysis. Proteins have been classified according to: Family and subfamily: families are groups of evolutionarily related proteins; subfamilies are related proteins that also have the same function. Molecular function: the function of the protein by itself or with directly interacting proteins at a biochemical level, e.g. a protein kinase. Biological process: the function of the protein in the context of a larger network of proteins that interact to accomplish a process at the level of the cell or organism, e.g. mitosis. Pathway: similar to biological process, but a pathway also explicitly specifies the relationships between the interacting molecules. (...) Version 8.1 (release date June 1, 2013) contains 7729 protein families, divided into 68,992 functionally distinct protein subfamilies.

Each subject category is represented by a code.
675	Helvetosaurus	https://helvetosaurus.sozialarchiv.ch/	"This thesaurus was based on EUROVOC, the thesaurus of the European Parliament and the Office for Official Publications of the European Union. The EUROVOC has been 'helvetized', meaning that expressions required in Switzerland have been supplemented, ambiguous or incomprehensible names have been deleted, and in some cases the hierarchical structure changed. Polyhierarchies (more than a generic term for the same sub-term) have been omitted altogether in the interests of clearer use. However, most of the EUROVOC descriptors were adopted, mainly based on version 2, supplemented by version 2.1 and the French version 3 draft. We did not adopt the distinction between domains, microthesauri and descriptors; all descriptors in Helvetosaurus are equivalent keywords that are embedded in a hierarchy. Helvetization was in German; the French version has been deferred for cost-benefit considerations, in agreement with the French-speaking staff of the documentation center. As sources for the Helvetization we mainly used documents of the parliamentary services and the federal administration, such as provisional list of keywords, registers and dossier divisions. In order to check how many times a word had been used, we were able to use databases of the parliamentary services, which are e.g. the parliamentary initiatives since 1983 contained in the full text.""

68	Thesaurus of Women's History		From the beginning, we saw that the thesauri we knew did not solve our specific needs, which is why we decided to create one again: the need to organize and interpret the material, which at first seemed technical And even boring, was the basis of our project.That was when the responsibility for its elaboration was taken up by the whole group of researchers, not to choose and classify words that would name the historical experiences of women Catalonia from the 9th to the 18th centuries, but to design, from the diversity of our experiences, semantic fields and concrete terms of an own language that gave meaning and meaning to the lives of women of the past and of history. Collective needs, converting an amalgam of personal needs into a common desire to make the world. The process of realizing the thesaurus has been Complex and enriching, sometimes harsh, in the sense that it has meant, at least for some of the women we have participated in, a rethinking of our being in history and in the world in political relation with other women, and not just as historians . The work, which originally emerged as a group work, became a work of relationship, through the discussion of individual knowledge and proposals with the rest of the team. We started the thesaurus by creating semantic fields and concepts from criticism to androcentric history, especially from the study of gender relations, in which the past and present social subordination of women is revealed and denounced, and a critical reconstruction is made Of social relations between the sexes, as defined by the patriarchal symbolic order. In this way, we defined a large section of our thesaurus that we call 'patriarchal order'. We did it relatively quickly, since we all knew too well 'the master's house', but arguing a lot, given the diversity of our analyzes and our experiences. 1420 terms. It arose from the need that the specialists in women's history felt - and felt - to be able to count on the basic instruments of work to develop more rigorously our research, and to guide the historians and historians interested in the subject.

69	Thesaurus History of Catalonia	http://www.vocabularyserver.com/historia_catalunya/	The History of Catalonia Thesaurus is a controlled vocabulary of terminology in Catalan, on the history of Catalonia. The ability to create our own documentary language also allows us to make a critical assessment of the terminology used in the Catalan historiography. The compilation of the concepts used and the subsequent analysis of these (equivalence relations, hierarchy and association) allow the reduction of the meanings of the terms to a single meaning, removing ambiguities and synonyms in a donor or other content. terminology included in the first stage of creating the database was collected in the Thesaurus of Contemporary History of Catalonia. the adaptation of the documentary language to the needs of the database extended to all historical periods, implied the incorporation of new terminology and the integration of new subject areas and structures (different types of admin istració, new social movements ...) The terminology contained in different databases county has been the starting point of this restructuring thesaurus in which this working language, as a tool that naixé strict documentary, s it has become a tool that provides information on the nature of the discipline and on important aspects of our history and peculiar. It should be mentioned that the terminology provided for each region reflects in part the particularities of its territory and history and enriches extremely thesaurus. 4395 terms, relations between terms 8142, 1018 equivalent terms.

701	Outline of World Cultures	http://hraf.yale.edu/resources/reference/outline-of-world-cultures-list/	This outline supplements the topical classification of the 'Outline of Cultural Materials' with a new outline organizing and classifying the known cultures of the world. The new system: (1) expedites the beginning of actual processing of information into the Human Relations Area Files, (2) permits excerpting of sources processed that pertain to cultures other than those for which files have been established, and (3) assures that societies selected for processing approach the ideal of a representative sample of the world's cultures. Thus, this outline is a reference to files of materials on 400 cultures covering eight geographical regions of the earth. Used in conjunction with the 'Outline of Cultural Materials', researchers can locate data on a cross-section of the world's cultures in 79 major divisions of information pertaining to cultural background. A sample and index of world cultures are included.

703	PRODCOM List	http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm	PRODCOM is the title of the EU production statistics for Mining, Quarrying and Manufacturing, i.e. Sections B and C of the Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community (NACE Rev. 2). The title comes from the French 'PRODuction COMmunautaire' (Community production). The headings of the PRODCOM list are derived from the Harmonized System (HS) or the Combined Nomenclature (CN), which thus enables comparisons to be made between production statistics and foreign trade statistics. PRODCOM headings are coded using an eight-digit numerical code, the first six digits of which are, in general, identical to those of the CPA code. The PRODCOM list is therefore linked to, and consistent with, the central product classification.
704	Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities	https://github.com/dhtaxonomy/TaDiRAH	This taxonomy of digital research activities in the humanities has been developed for use by community-driven sites and projects that aim to structure information relevant to digital humanities and make it more easily discoverable. The taxonomy is expected to be particularly useful to endeavors aiming to collect information on digital humanities tools, methods, projects, or readings.
705	Vital Sign Ontology		The Vital Sign Ontology (VSO) is an extension of the Ontology for General Medical Science (OGMS). VSO covers the four consensus human vital signs: blood pressure, body temperature, respiration rate, pulse rate.

708	Web Service Interaction Ontology	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/WSIO	Web Service Interaction Ontology (WSIO) enables automated interaction with more complex Web services that are typical for example within life sciences. WSIO is however independent of the application domain and relevant for both SOAP and REST Web services, and for batch execution engines in general. If the interaction scenario with a Web service is nontrivial (and incorporates session handling), annotation with WSIO concepts will enable automatic generation of client programs, scripts, or interactive applications with a graphical user interface. WSIO also enables automation of different ways of data transfer and data un-/compression or en-/decoding. We strongly discourage providers from developing complex interaction and data-transfer/compression scenarios, however when needed, WSIO may enable smooth automated interaction with them. Future versions will support more interaction scenarios. WSIO aims to serve also as a means to standardise the complex interaction scenarios primarily within both SOAP and REST Web services, and secondarily to apply also to batch execution infrastructure in general.
709	Ontology for Biomedical Investigations	http://obi.sourceforge.net/ontologyInformation/	The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) project is developing an integrated ontology for the description of biological and clinical investigations. This includes a set of 'universal' terms, that are applicable across various biological and technological domains, and domain-specific terms relevant only to a given domain. This ontology will support the consistent annotation of biomedical investigations, regardless of the particular field of study. The ontology will represent the design of an investigation, the protocols and instrumentation used, the material used, the data generated and the type analysis performed on it. Currently OBI is being built under the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO).

710	Sport Ontology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/sport/	The Sport Ontology is a simple lightweight ontology for publishing data about competitive sports events. The terms in this ontology allow data to be published about: The structure of sports tournaments as a series of events, the competing of agents in a competition, the type of discipline a event involves, the award associated with the competition and how received it ...etc. Whilst it originates in a specific BBC use case, the Sport Ontology should be applicable to a wide range of competitive sporting events data publishing use cases. Care has been taken to try and ensure interoperability with more general ontologies in use. In particular it draws heavily upon the events ontology.
711	Music Ontology	http://purl.org/ontology/mo/	The Music Ontology Specification provides main concepts and properties fo describing music (i.e. artists, albums and tracks) on the Semantic Web. This vocabulary defines 54 classes and 153 properties. Music Ontology data can be published by anyone as part of a web site or an API and linked with existing data, therefore creating a music-related web of data.
712	Friend of a Friend vocabulary	http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/	FOAF is a project devoted to linking people and information using the Web. Regardless of whether information is in people's heads, in physical or digital documents, or in the form of factual data, it can be linked. FOAF integrates three kinds of network: social networks of human collaboration, friendship and association; representational networks that describe a simplified view of a cartoon universe in factual terms, and information networks that use Web-based linking to share independently published descriptions of this inter-connected world. FOAF does not compete with socially-oriented Web sites; rather it provides an approach in which different sites can tell different parts of the larger story, and by which users can retain some control over their information in a non-proprietary format.
713	Event Ontology	http://motools.sf.net/event/event.html	This ontology is centered around the notion of event, seen here as the way by which cognitive agents classify arbitrary time/space regions (...). This ontology has already been proven useful in a wide range of context, due to its simplicity and usability: from talks in a conference, to description of a concert, or chords being played in a Jazz piece (when used with the Timeline ontology), festivals, etc.
714	Timeline Ontology	http://motools.sf.net/timeline/timeline.html	This ontology is centered around the notion of timeline, seen here as a way to identify a temporal backbone. A timeline may support a signal, a video, a score, a work, etc. This ontology, used with the Event ontology, can be used to annotate sections of a signal, a video, or any temporal object. For example, it can be used to express: This shot holds between this frame and that frame, in this video; This performance happened at that particular date; In this song, the first chorus is before the second verse; A new structural segment starts at 2 minutes and 43 seconds, on this signal; This signal is a sampled version of this one; This part of the score corresponds to this section in an actual performance (in progress...).

72	Thesaurus for the Indexation of Local Archives		The revised thesaurus remains a mono-hierarchical thesaurus, that is, a given descriptor is linked to only one thematic branch. Descriptors for the different modes of transport are in a transport hierarchy in Chapter 3 COMMUNICATIONS, whereas the terms relating to transport infrastructure are in a 'communication channel' hierarchy in Chapter 6 EQUIPMENT. 'Rail transport' is referred to as an associated term in the hierarchy of 'communication channels' and 'railway networks' Is a term associated with 'rail transport' in the 'transport' hierarchy The 1997 edition consisted of 1015 descriptors and non-descriptors. And 460 new descriptors for the thesaurus, 15 new terms for the list of Actions authorities, 64 new document typologies and 122 new descriptors for the historical context. The working group also proposes the deletion of 18 descriptors and 11 non-descriptors, the transformation of 8 descriptors into non-descriptors and 7 non-descriptors into descriptors, the displacement of 36 descriptors in the hierarchy, and the addition of 306 Non-descriptive synonymy terms of the 'employ' type. At the same time, in response to requests from the services for a structured version of the thesaurus for integration into archival software, the Archives of France management has carried out tests to convert the thesaurus to the SKOS format (Simple System d Organization of knowledge), a format allowing the easy publication of structured vocabularies for their use in the semantic Web. The revised thesaurus is not restricted to archives in the strict sense but must in principle be applicable to all resources held by public or private archives (including iconographic collections and libraries).
721	Citation Typing Ontology	http://purl.org/spar/cito/	CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology, is an ontology written in OWL 2 DL to enable characterization of the nature or type of citations, both factually and rhetorically, and to permit these descriptions to be published on the Web. The citations characterized may be either direct and explicit (as in the reference list of a journal article), indirect (e.g. a citation to a more recent paper by the same research group on the same topic), or implicit (e.g. as in artistic quotations or parodies, or in cases of plagiarism). CiTO contains the object property cito:cites and its sub-properties, and its inverse property cito:isCitedBy, from the original Citation Typing Ontology, CiTO v1.6. Upon the creation of version 2.0 of CiTO, a number of new sub-properties of cito:cites were added, and the inverse properties of all the sub-properties of cito:cites were created, all of which are sub-properties of cito:isCitedBy. The ontology has also been integrated with the SWAN Discourse Relationships Ontology by making cito:cites a sub-property of http://purl.org/swan/2.0/discourse-relationships/refersTo. Restrictions of domain and range present in the previous version of CiTO were removed from the object properties when creating CiTO v 2.0, permitting its independent use in other contexts, in addition to conventional bibliographic citations.

726	Publishing Requirements for Industry Standard Metadata	http://prismstandard.org/Pam_1.0/PAMGuide1_0.pdf	PRISM Publishing Requirements for Industry Standard Metadata defines an XML/RDF metadata vocabulary for managing, aggregating, post-processing, multi-purposing and aggregating magazine, news, catalog, book, and mainstream journal content. PRISM recommends the use of certain existing standards, such as XML, RDF, the Dublin Core, and various ISO specifications for locations, languages, and date/time formats. In addition PRISM provides a framework for the interchange and preservation of content and metadata, a collection of elements to describe that content, and a set of controlled vocabularies listing the values for those elements. Metadata is an exceedingly broad category of information covering everything from an article's country of origin to the fonts used in its layout.PRISM's scope is driven by the needs of publishers to receive, track, and deliver multi-part content. The focus is on additional uses for the content, so metadata concerning the content's appearance is outside PRISM's scope.

791	Energy Types Used in Private Dwellings – Standard Classification	http://www.stats.govt.nz/methods/classifications-and-standards/classification-related-stats-standards/energy-privte-dwell.aspx	Information on the types of energy consumed in occupied New Zealand private dwellings is used for marketing research and to monitor changes, over time, in the energy types used by New Zealand households. It is an indicator of the habitability of houses, when used in conjunction with information on dampness and insulation levels and is an important variable in deriving the deprivation index. The information may also be combined with other variables to help forecast and plan energy requirements and distribution, enable natural resource accounting, and monitor trends in energy efficiency and conservation. Energy Types Used in Private Dwellings is a hierarchical classification with 2 levels. It has nine categories at the highest level and 26 categories at the second level – excluding residual categories.

794	Fertility – Standard Classification	http://www.stats.govt.nz/methods/classifications-and-standards/classification-related-stats-standards/fertility.aspx	Fertility is one of the main ways through which the size and/or composition of a population may change. Statistics on fertility are required to provide basic demographic information, and to inform the study of differences and changes in reproductive patterns, family size and structure in various age, ethnic and other sub-groups, including geographic areas, of the New Zealand population. This information provides central government agencies, local authorities, health authorities, researchers, private organisations and businesses with valuable information required for planning current and future social and community services, facilities and products. A statistical standard for fertility is required to clearly define the concepts being measured and to ensure that collections of this data will be consistent across surveys and over time. Fertility is a flat classification in number of children categories from no children to nine children plus a category for ten or more children. The classification has 11 categories – excluding residual categories.
795	Statistical Classification of Financial Assets and Liabilities	http://www.stats.govt.nz/methods/classifications-and-standards/classification-related-stats-standards/financial-assets-and-liabilities-new.aspx	The main purpose of classifying financial assets and liabilities is to provide consistent and relevant statistics that support economic analysis and macroeconomic management for New Zealand. As these classes have economic-based meanings, their definitions can vary from accounting and taxation definitions. Financial assets and liabilities will respond differently to fiscal and monetary policy depending on their type, and under various economic conditions. Financial asset and liability statistics are useful for assessing: liquidity and financial soundness of sectors; exposure to financial risks; sensitivity to monetary and fiscal policy; leverage within the economy or institutional sectors; the composition of a sector’s assets and liabilities; claims on other sectors, including the rest of the world. The Statistical Classification of Financial Assets and Liabilities 2013 (SCFAL), which underpins this statistical standard, is largely based on the classification of financial assets and liabilities in the System of National Accounts 2008 (2008 SNA). Therefore the concepts and definitions within this standard also align closely with the 2008 SNA manual. It provides a standard system for classifying the financial assets and liabilities of all institutional units within the economy. Because of the symmetry of financial assets and liabilities, the same classification is used for both assets and liabilities.
796	New Zealand Framework for Cultural Statistics	http://www.stats.govt.nz/methods/classifications-and-standards/classification-related-stats-standards/framework-for-cultural-statistics.aspx	In 1993, the Ministry of Cultural Affairs approached Statistics New Zealand to discuss strategies for improving the range and quality of statistical information available on New Zealand's cultural sector. With its responsibility for collecting statistics relevant to the needs of government, business and the community, Statistics New Zealand agreed that improvement was needed. In order to define what was meant by 'cultural statistics' and to provide direction for future work, it was agreed that the first priority should be the production of a framework for cultural statistics. The two organisations jointly commenced work on the framework at the beginning of 1994. The standard classification of framework for cultural statistics is a hierarchical classification of three levels. Level 1 of the classification has nine categories, level 2 has 24 categories and level 3 has 70 categories.

Bands reduce respondent burden by providing a simple way to obtain contextual information about income. Income bands are often tabulated with other variables such as age, occupation and education qualifications to provide information on the relationship between these variables and the income distribution of the population. In addition, when income information has been collected as dollar amounts, it may be output as income bands. This provides statistics on the distribution of income across the population, which is not provided by average income. Income band statistics are used extensively within Statistics New Zealand, across government, and by other agencies and academics for: formulating social and economic policy; calculating school deciles; use as an indicator for poverty statistics and the New Zealand Index of Deprivation; research and planning; monitoring programmes.

This is done by grouping economic units that have similar roles and which respond to economic events and interventions in a similar manner. Institutional sector statistics are useful for: monitoring the effects of fiscal and monetary policy; analysing investment and consumption behaviour; studying the source and disposal of incomes and the origin of savings; identifying the direction and method of transfer of savings from one sector to another; recognising the funding sources of investment and, consequently, borrowing and lending between sectors. The statistical standard was developed in 2013. The statistical classification for institutional sectors is a hierarchical classification with three levels. The sector level has six categories. The subsector level has 18 categories. The group level of the classification has 21 categories.

820	Unified Astronomy Thesaurus		The Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT) is an open, interoperable and community-supported thesaurus which unifies the existing divergent and isolated Astronomy & Astrophysics thesauri into a single high-quality, freely-available open thesaurus formalizing astronomical concepts and their inter-relationships. The UAT builds upon the existing IAU Thesaurus with major contributions from the Astronomy portions of the thesauri developed by the Institute of Physics Publishing and the American Institute of Physics. We expect that the Unified Astronomy Thesaurus will be further enhanced and updated through a collaborative effort involving broad community participation. While the AAS has assumed formal ownership of the UAT, the work will be available under a Creative Commons License, ensuring its widest use while protecting the intellectual property of the contributors. We envision that development and maintenance will be stewarded by a broad group of parties having a direct stake in it. This includes professional associations (IVOA, IAU), learned societies (AAS, RAS), publishers (IOP, AIP), librarians and other curators working for major astronomy institutes and data archives. The main impetus behind the creation of a single thesaurus has been the wish to support semantic enrichment of the literature, but we expect that use of the UAT (along with other vocabularies and ontologies currently being developed in our community) will be much broader and will have a positive impact on the discovery of a wide range of astronomy resources, including data products and services.

Let us recall that a thesaurus is a list of organized authority of descriptors and non-descriptors obeying their own terminological rules and linked by semantic relations (hierarchical, associative or equivalence). This controlled set of terms serves not only for the indexing of documents, but also a posteriori facilitates the search for information in these same documents. This is true of the Thesaurus of the Journal des débats. Designed to regularize and standardize the indexing of the Journal of Debates, it can also be used to locate information by suggesting various avenues of research. The Thesaurus of the Journal des débats is an evolving tool. An update is periodically carried out to adapt it to its documentary function. There is addition of descriptors if, during the indexing or the documentary search, one finds that notions or relations between the notions have not been sufficiently specified. A descriptor is removed if it is subsequently found to be inadequate. If this descriptor has been used for indexing and is replaced by another more relevant term, a reference to the preferred term is added.

This part specifies a conceptual data schema that defines the structure of a metadata instance for a learning object. For this standard, a learning object is defined as any entity - digital or non-digital - that may be used for learning, education, or training. For this standard, a metadata instance for a learning object describes relevant characteristics of the learning object to which it applies. Such characteristics may be grouped in general, life cycle, meta-metadata, educational, technical, educational, rights, relation, annotation, and classification categories. The conceptual data schema specified in this part permits linguistic diversity of both learning objects and the metadata instances that describe them. The purpose of this multi-part standard is to facilitate search, evaluation, acquisition, and use of learning objects, for instance by learners or instructors or automated software processes. This multi-part standard also facilitates the sharing and exchange of learning objects, by enabling the development of catalogs and inventories while taking into account the diversity of cultural and lingual contexts in which the learning objects and their metadata are reused.

85	Beethoven Thesaurus	http://bvc.sjlibrary.org/	The Beethoven Thesaurus is a list of approximately 9,000 subject and category (formerly known as genre) terms. The thesaurus groups these terms together in nine sections (or hierarchies). Terms are listed in alphabetical order within each section, with instructions on the scope of the terms, their relationships with other terms in the Thesaurus, and unused synonyms. Each listing might also include instructions to the indexer on how to apply the term to a particular subject area. In order to facilitate use by the largest audience possible, the Thesaurus terms were derived from Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) and subdivisions whenever possible. Additional headings more specific to Beethoven studies were created when necessary to lead users to subjects that they cannot search with LCSHs. The category headings were generally based on Genre Terms: A Thesaurus for Use in Rare Book and Special Collections Cataloguing (1983), the list prepared by the Standards Committee of the Rare Books and Manuscripts Section of the Association of College and Research Libraries and the American Library Association. As needed, these Category terms were supplemented with music and Beethoven-related terms. Used for searching the Beethoven Gateway.

857	BIBFRAME	http://bibframe.org/vocab	The BIBFRAME Model is a conceptual/practical model that balances the needs of those recording detailed bibliographic description, the needs of those describing other cultural materials, and those who do not require such a detailed level of description. There are four high-level classes, or entitities, in the BIBFRAME Model: BIBFRAME Work; BIBFRAME Instance; BIBFRAME Authority; BIBFRAME Annotation. BIBFRAME Work identifies the conceptual essence of something; a BIBFRAME Instance reflects the material embodiment of a Work; a BIBFRAME Authority identifies a thing or concept associated with a BIBFRAME Work or Instance; and a BIBFRAME Annotation provides a new way to expand the description of a BIBFRAME Work, Instance, or Authority. You can read more about the BIBFRAME Model here. The BIBFRAME Vocabulary is the key to the description of resources. Like the MARC format has a defined set of elements and attributes, the BIBFRAME Vocabulary has a defined set of classes and properties. A class identifies a type of BIBFRAME resource (much like a MARC field might bundle a single concept); properties serve a means to further describe a BIBFRAME resource (much like MARC subfields more specifically identify aspects of the concept).

862	Colon Classification	http://www.iskoi.org/doc/colon.htm	Colon classification (CC) is a system of library classification developed by S. R. Ranganathan. It was the first ever faceted (or analytico-synthetic) classification. The first edition was published in 1933. Since then six more editions have been published. It is especially used in libraries in India. Its name 'colon classification' comes from the use of colons to separate facets in class numbers. However, many other classification schemes, some of which are completely unrelated, also use colons and other punctuation in various functions. They should not be confused with colon classification.

864	A Classification System for Libraries of Judaica	https://sites.google.com/site/mtevansco/elazar-classification	While it was conceived in 1952, the first published edition of this classification system appeared in 1962. Since then, its use has spread widely throughout the United States, Israel and other parts of the Jewish world. Libraries of all kinds, in synagogues and community centers, in Hebrew schools, on college campuses and in research institutions, have adopted the scheme and worked with it. As a result, a body of experience in applying the system to all these diverse institutions developed, clearly demonstrating the need for minimal changes in the system from time to time while reaffirming the utility of its basic organizing principles. Meanwhile, the intervening years have been full of events deeply significant in contemporary Jewish history, all of which need to be reflected in an up-to-date classification scheme.
865	Weine Classification Scheme and Relative Index for Judaica Libraries	http://jewishlibraries.org/content.php	The lack of a satisfactory classification scheme for the average Jewish library has long been a problem to the Jewish librarian. Many solutions have been suggested and attempted, with varying degrees of success. The classification scheme of the Library of Congress, which has now been adopted by most of the great scholarly Jewish libraries of the country, suffers from the drawbacks of being unknown to most of the general public. On the other hand, the Dewey Decimal System as it stands, although familiar even to school children, presents certain difficulties when applied to a specialized collection. The excessive subdivision required in certain numbers, the lack of provision for certain subject areas which do not fit satisfactorily into the Dewey system, are drawbacks which librarians in the Jewish field have long struggled with. It was to meet these objections that the author devised the present scheme. Although based upon the Dewey system, certain areas have been drastically revised, most notably in the fields of religion, Jewish education, and history. In every case, whether or not explicitly stated, the number refers only to the Jewish aspect of the subject in question. Since the scheme is intended only for Judaica collections, the letter 'z' has been added throughout, to distinguish it from the regular Dewey system. This will be useful in the case of librarians with 'mixed' collections, i.e., containing books of a general as well as of a Jewish nature. This classification scheme is intended primarily for a small Judaica library, such as one in a synagogue or school. Very large or very scholarly collections will probably find the Library of Congress classification more suited to their needs.

SuDocs numbers consist of a letter, designating the particular issuing agency, followed by numbers identifying subordinate bureaus within the agencies and specific publications.

872	Nigerian Local Government Area Geodemographic Classification System and Profiler	http://www.nigerianlgaclassification.com/	In a nut-shell, a geodemographic classification system is an attempt to simplify a large and complex body of information about people, where and how they live, work or recreate. It is developed on geographical ideas that similar people with similar characteristics are more likely to live within the same locality and that such area types will be distributed in different locations across geographical space. The Nigerian LGA classification system encapsulates spatially referenced datasets for the year 2006 sourced from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) for each of the 774 LGAs in the country. Every LGA has been placed in one of 6 Super-groups, and into one of 23 Groups and finally into one of 57 Sub-groups. This hierarchical structure of Super-groups, Groups and Sub-groups allows for greater flexibility and means that analysis, visualisation and reporting can be done at any of the three levels. The Nigerian system is the first African open source geodemographic classification system recognised in academic literature. It therefore leads the way for a new era of unbiased approach to understanding a wide range of issues within the public sector, private sector and indeed the academia.

875	Road Network Classification	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_in_Kenya	The Current Road Classification System was developed over 30 years ago and has six road classes named from Classes A to E and a Special Purpose Road class. Each class is defined by the functional criteria related to administrative level of centres the roads connect. The system covers only 61,936km of the entire road network of 160,886km while the rest 98,950km are not classified. (...) The current road classification system was developed over 30 years ago. Since then the road network has grown rapidly and changed in character. (...) The new classification system covers all public roads and extends to the presently unclassified rural and urban roads. The main thrust of the approach is to make the classification more objective and consistent by specifying quantifiable parameters (traffic, population, spacing) to guide the selection of appropriate road classes. It is also a dynamic system where road classes can be periodically reviewed to adapt to changes in traffic, function etc. The proposed Road Classification System sees Kenya's road network as being composed of two distinct networks i.e. the Rural Roads Network (outside Cities and Municipalities) and the Urban Roads Network (within Cities and Municipalities) for all public roads with 9m or more road reserves. Although the new classification system retains A,B,C,D and E classes, the system has been extended to include additional classes. It should be noted that presently classified roads do not necessarily retain their road classes under the new classification.

883	HIV/AIDS Thesaurus	http://www.actoronto.org/home.nsf/pages/thesaurusterms	Although there are many specialized thesauri in the health and the social sciences, the HIV/AIDS Thesaurus is unique in its character and focus. 1. Community-based - We have tried as much as possible to make the thesaurus reflect the language and values of community-based AIDS service organizations, rather than the terminology of technical or medical professions. The thesaurus is, therefore, not based on existing systems such as Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) or Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). For example, we use the term 'Poppers' rather than the more technical term 'Amyl Nitrates', and 'Drug Use' rather than the more judgmental term 'Drug Abuse'. 2. Comprehensive - Resource centres in AIDS service organizations tend to collect a broad range of HIV/AIDS material. The thesaurus reflects this broad scope by covering all aspects of HIV/AIDS: everything from basic science and treatment to prevention, the arts and the psychological, social, and political aspects of the epidemic. 3. Based on Literary Warrant - 'Literary warrant' is a concept librarians use to decide whether the creation of a subject term is justified by the quantity of literature available. We only created subject terms when there were sufficient numbers of books, periodical articles, videos, and audio tapes to warrant the heading. Other subject tools take theory as their point of departure not the production and publication of information. We avoided creating terms simply on the basis of theoretical considerations or out of a sense of symmetry. For instance, we allow for the headings 'Hepatitis B' and 'Hepatitis C', but do not include terms for other types of hepatitis (e.g. hepatitis A, hepatitis D, etc.). This decision was made because 'Hepatitis B' and 'Hepatitis C' are warranted by the number of books and videos on that topic, while books specific to other types of hepatitis are rare in our collection. 4. Based on a Psychosocial, Consumer Health Collection - The first edition of the thesaurus was developed to describe the broad subject scope of books. Narrower terms are added to the second edition so that the thesaurus can be used to describe the more specific content of periodical articles. The thesaurus still remains, however, a list of terms used to describe a psychosocial, consumer health focused collection. The overall depth of the thesaurus has not greatly increased and terms are still more general than terms that would be used to describe articles in a medical or treatment focused collection.

889	Furniture Dictionary	http://tesauros.mecd.es/tesauros/mobiliario.html	The furniture has been an important part of the home environment of man throughout history. Although its role has been primarily functional, has been enriched with other meanings of social and cultural aspects that make the furniture an essential element of cultural heritage. This includes thesaurus terminology referring to designations of furniture, their types, specific formal descriptors, as well as materials and processing techniques and decorating them.
89	British Museum Materials Thesaurus		The decision to publish The British Museum materials thesaurus was based on the interest shown in it over the years by visiting documentation specialists, and their requests for copies. In my opinion, the thesaurus is unique, due to the great range of terms included, the inevitable consequence of documenting world-wide collections from almost any historical period, a great variety of cultures, and covering almost any type of object. The eclectic nature of the listing precluded the possibility of importing a thesaurus into our documentation system, and we therefore had to devise our own version. The greatest difficulty lay in providing an overall structure which could accommodate specialised terminology, archaic or local names for certain materials, and everyday nomenclature as well. Our thesaurus indicates one approach, no doubt there are many others (indeed we tried several before settling on the current structure). I am reassured by the fact that our users regularly retrieve records by material, using the thesaurus as a retrieval tool. Three Top Terms are provided - 'Organic', 'Inorganic' and 'Processed Material' and are generally mutually exclusive. 'Organic' is defined as naturally occurring animal and plant material, and naturally occurring substances derived from them. 'Inorganic' is defined as naturally occurring material which, for the purposes of this thesaurus, is not of organic origin, i.e. mainly minerals and stones. 'Processed material' may be regarded as material which has been manufactured or has undergone some form of processing (such as smelting) to alter it from its original natural state. The definitions of the three categories are provided for general guidance, rather than as strict formulations. It is accepted that there are grey areas, particularly in deciding whether a substance is processed or not. However the primary intention is to group materials in a way which is meaningful to the average user. 2129 terms, 513 relations between terms, 284 non-preferred terms. It is stressed that the final listing is not intended as a scientific classification system, rather it is a reflection of the terminology, both current and historical, in use in curatorial departments in The British Museum.
890	Management Thesaurus	http://bibliotheque.tbs-education.fr/thesaurus/thesaurus.html	A long tradition of cooperation brings together documentalists from the major French management schools, and many exchanges and common achievements have made it possible to establish a wide network of information, training and mutual assistance. Are constituted in association (ACIEGE, Association of the managers of the information centers of the schools of management). Most of them use the Management Thesaurus based on the work of the Van Dijk Office and Georges Sandeau for their documentary system, the third edition of which is dated from 1986. As early as 1976, the need for permanent maintenance work , In order to ensure its relevance to the evolution of the fields covered, to adapt it to the requirements of the increasing level of management techniques, without neglecting the pedagogical function in training future managers in research and The rational use of information. The working group composed of representatives of ten grandes écoles is the guarantor of the continuous evolution of the thesaurus and ensures its control, in accordance with the maintenance rules: the proposed amendments are examined at a bi-annual meeting which validates the creation, The deletion of descriptors or equivalent terms and the establishment of judicious links between descriptors. These operations are essential to ensure the operational character of this documentary tool, in constant contact with reality, in the interests of coherence and a proven methodology. Each semantic field has been fully resumed, analyzed, and restructured in depth. This tool is intended to be alive and particularly adapted to the use of the information resources of schools of management. The Management Thesaurus is now available in three languages: French, English and Spanish and in various formats.
891	The panlatine lexicon of economic marketing	http://www.realiter.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Lex_pan_MkEc.pdf	The panlatine lexicon of economic marketing was developed within the Panlatine Network of Terminology (Realiter) and coordinated by Prof. Dr. Angela Bidu Vrănceanu, University of Bucharest. The final synthesis and editing of the material was made by Roxana Cioloaneanu. The field of economic marketing is relatively new and its dynamics is continuous.The applicative interest of this field is complex and refers to aspects of economy, trade, advertising, communication The list of illustrative terms for this field has been selected and limited to about 150 terms, Since marketing is a complex and heterogeneous domain whose limits are difficult to establish, we have tried to cover different areas of marketing by selecting terms belonging to Of its various sub-areas, such as: marketing research, promotion policy, consumer behavior, distribution policy. This selection is also motivated by the diachronic evolution of marketing, discussed in the literature as being carried out in three stages: 1) 1900-1920: marketing deals with selling products on the market (sale); 2) The 1950s added a dimension, namely, the advertisement; 3) Due to the economic growth of the 50s and 60s, which led to an increase in competition, sales orientation of marketing has turned into customer orientation (consumer behavior) (see Zollondz 2007: 14-20). The elaboration of the marketing lexicon had as its starting point the Romanian language, the terms being selected from the Romanian specialized dictionaries and checked in specialized texts (scientific texts, didactic texts) and in economic press articles. For each term, equivalents were given in six languages Romance (taking into account their territorial distribution where appropriate): Catalan, Spanish (Spain, Argentina, Mexico), French (France, Canada), Galician, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil). Also for each term the English equivalent is provided. The terms in the Pantellean Lexicon of Economic Marketing can be consulted in each of the above-mentioned languages ​​by using the alphabetical index for each language. All terms benefit from indicating the appropriate grammatical category. For some terms, quasi (synonyms) and / or writing variants have been recorded. (Cvasi) the synonyms in Romanian appear immediately under the title-term, and for the other Romance languages, they are listed one below the other. The arrow (→) means the reference to another title-term (Quasi) synonym from the list. The inventory of terms includes both simple terms and terminological terms. The latter were taken over as such by the Romanian specialized dictionaries. For some simple terms, with circulation in other specialized languages, as well as in the common language, deconfiguring contexts, extracts from specialized texts and articles in the press and marked In square brackets []. Each of the contributors to the Panlatine Lexicon of Economic Marketing project is responsible for the terms provided as equivalents in that language. We believe that the panlatine lexicon of marketing will facilitate interlingual communication and will satisfy the complex (extralinguistic, linguistic and terminological) interest in this field. The target audience is represented by specialists In several areas: economics, commerce, advertising, media and, last but not least, terminologists and linguists.
892	Thesaurus of Senado Federal	http://www.senado.gov.br/publicacoes/thes/	The Secretariat for Information, the Department of Documentation and Information of the Senate, keeps the terminological control (...)

893	Chinese Library Classification	http://clc.nlc.cn/	"China Library Book Classification"" is a representative of China after the founding of a large-scale comprehensive classification, referred to as ""since the law."" Since the fourth edition in 1999 changed its name to ""China Library Classification ""Abbreviation is unchanged, the English translation of the Chinese Library Classification, the English abbreviation for the CLC."" Chinese law ""and other domestic classification, compared to the preparation of late, but the development of fast, it not only systematically summed up our classification At present, the ""China map"" has been widely used in the various types of libraries, the major domestic large bibliography, search journals, machine readable database, and ""China"" in the preparation of foreign classification of the theory and technology. National Standard Book Number ""and so on are recorded"" in the law ""classification number."
894	Info-Muse Classification System for Ethnology, History and Historical Archaeology Museums	http://www.smq.qc.ca/publicsspec/guidesel/doccoll/en/classificationethno/	The Info-Muse classification system for ethnology, history and historical archaeology museums is largely based on the classification system for Parks Canada Service collections, itself based in part on The Revised Nomenclature for Museum Cataloging. This system is the fruit of collaboration between Parks Canada, the Musée de la civilisation and the Société des musées québécois. The definitions of terms are drawn mainly from the Parks Canada document. The classification system makes it possible to group objects in a collection by their original function. It divides them up into a hierarchy in which the smallest unit is the object name, the intermediate unit is the sub-category and the largest unit is the category. This structure makes it possible to organize information on object identification in a logical, meaningful manner. Using a standardized system to divide up information makes it simpler to search for and access records. To maximize system performance, standardized terms must be used to identify the objects. Using the classification system gives a better overview of collections, so that users can spot similarities and differences, groupings and contrasts within a collection itself. In addition to offering better understanding of the content of collections, the classification system promotes reflection on guidelines for collecting, research options and ideal means of sharing the knowledge gained.
895	Info-Muse Classification System for Fine Arts and Decorative Arts museums	http://www.smq.qc.ca/publicsspec/guidesel/doccoll/en/classificationarts/	Since 1995, the Info-Muse classification system for fine arts and decorative arts collections has been based on the Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), with the approval of AAT authorities. The system is based on painstaking research work done by Thérèse Labbé, at the time a museology consultant, who successfully completed this job for the Info-Muse Network. Representatives of the David M. Stewart Foundation, the Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal, the David M. Stewart Museum, the Montreal Museum of Decorative Arts, the Musée des Sœurs grises de Montréal, the Musée du Québec, CHIN and the Info-Muse Network also contributed. The system was revised again in 2006 to reflect changes relating to the increasing diversity of practices in contemporary art. Thérèse Labbé, researcher-documentalist at the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec, agreed to lead a discussion group on the subject. Representatives of the Leonard & Bina Ellen Gallery, the Ministère de la Culture et des Communications du Québec, the Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and the City of Gatineau were involved in the work. The two subdivisions of the AAT's 'Art' subgroup, namely 'Fine Arts' and 'Decorative Arts', correspond to the categories in the Info-Muse classification system. The 'Fine Arts' sub-categories have to do with the various artistic disciplines and the 'Decorative Arts' sub-categories refer to the various families or groups of applied arts and their use in industry.
896	Classification of Meshblock	http://www.stats.govt.nz/methods/classifications-and-standards/classification-related-stats-standards/meshblock.aspx	The standard classification of Meshblock is a flat classification and contains 46,643 categories in 2014. The classification is released annually on 1 January.
897	Religious Affiliation – New Zealand Standard Classification	http://www.stats.govt.nz/methods/classifications-and-standards/classification-related-stats-standards/religious-affiliation.aspx	Religious affiliation is a variable of strong interest to religious organisations, social scientists, and can be used as an explanatory variable in studies on topics such as marriage formation and dissolution, fertility and income. In Australia and in Britain, religion is a variable that is used to derive measures of ethnicity. In New Zealand, religious affiliation is of particular significance for data users interested in Māori and in Pacific Island peoples. It is a variable of historical interest as well; religious affiliation has been collected in the New Zealand Census of Population and Dwellings since 1851. The standard classification of religious affiliation is a hierarchical classification of three levels. Level 1 of the classification has nine categories, level 2 has 40 categories and level 3 has 84 categories – excluding residual categories.
898	Standard Classification of Territorial Authority	http://www.stats.govt.nz/methods/classifications-and-standards/classification-related-stats-standards/territorial-authority.aspx	The standard classification of territorial authority is a flat classification and contains 68 categories. It is released annually on the 1st of January, and on occasion mid year, but there are not always changes from the previous classification.
899	Zoological Record Thesaurus	https://images.webofknowledge.com/WOK50B6/help/ZOOREC/hsa_zrthesaurus.html	The Zoological Record Thesaurus contains controlled terms used to index records. It also contains uncontrolled terms as entry points to controlled (preferred) terms. The five major hierarchies in the thesaurus are: Subject; Geographical; Palaeontological; Systematic; Taxa Notes. You can expand each hierarchy to browse for controlled terms and to see their positions in the hierarchy. You can also search the entire combined thesaurus to find the appropriate controlled term(s) for your search.
9	Archives in London and the M25 Area Thesaurus	http://www.aim25.ac.uk/browse.htm	AIM25 uses subject terms taken from the UNESCO thesaurus, with the inclusion of terms at a more detailed level or for cross referring purposes from other thesauri where appropriate. These include, for instance, terms from Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH), Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and the Australian Human Services and Health Thesaurus (HSH). The AIM25 version of the UNESCO Thesaurus also includes more specialised subject terms contributed by AIM25 repositories, the Public Record Office, the AIM25 Project team, the British Education Thesaurus, Library of Congress subject terms, and the SOAS Missionary thesaurus, where they are considered to be helpful in locating descriptions. The provenance of subject terms is marked against each term in the alphabetical or hierarchical lists. For example UNESCO terms are marked with a [U] and AIM25 added terms are marked with [A]. Personal and corporate names are formulated according to the Rules for the construction of personal, place and corporate names developed and published by the UK National Council on Archives (1997). Place names are fitted into the country groupings given in section 7 of the UNESCO Thesaurus, with the addition of Seas, Oceans and Arctic Regions. Descriptions are also indexed by subjects and by names of persons, corporate organizations, and places associated with the description and these indexing terms or 'index entries' are listed at the end of each description. Subject thesaurus and Name index assisted searching uses these index entries. The index entries are limited to those available in the database, so they guarantee at least one hit on a relevant description.
90	British Museum Object Names Thesaurus	http://old.collectionstrust.org.uk/assets/thesaurus_bmon/Objintro.htm	A Collections Data Management Section (CDMS) Working Party was set up in the 1980s to analyse the terms used to record object names in the British Museum, and to incorporate them into an on-line thesaurus. Hierarchical and other standard thesaural relationships were added, as well as explanatory notes where appropriate. The thesaurus architecture is based on ISO 2788. Curatorial advice has been sought at all stages of the project, and a number of publications were consulted, which are listed in the bibliography. Members of the Working Party also contributed extensively to the Museum Documentation Association (mda) Terminology Working Group and to the mda Archaeological Objects Thesaurus Working Party. The initial entries were generated from the object name indexes to the databases, consisting of terms taken from a variety of documentary sources (such as registers, file cards and catalogues). Hence the terms in the thesaurus are not full descriptions of the objects; these are entered in the Description field. The choice of Top Terms and Broad Terms was determined by common retrieval enquiries and by the nature of the British Museum's collections, and includes functional object name categories (e.g. vessel) as well as those referring to an activity (e.g. dance equipment) or concept (e.g. religious/ritual equipment). The addition of the word 'equipment' allows for object names describing ancillary equipment to be included in each category. Thus for example, the music equipment hierarchy incorporates music-book as well as musical instrument. The thesaurus reflects the nature of the British Museum collections, and was originally set up as an internal reference tool. Some areas of terminology may be more specific than others, depending on the level of documentation available, or the size of particular collections.

It extends the list of those defined in the IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry, Section E: Stereochemistry (Recommendations 1974) and includes some terms from the Glossary of Terms used in Physical Organic Chemistry (Recommendations 1994). Additional terms have been added from inorganic and macromolecular chemistry. Some misleading terms are included together with guidance on correct usage or acceptable alternatives. Many of the symbols used in stereochemical nomenclature are mentioned but details of their assignment or their incorporation into chemical names are left to the appropriate recommendations. Terminology related to techniques used in the determination of stereochemistry are largely excluded as well as terms used to describe reaction mechanisms.

908	Classification Lenoch		The system comprises forty-six main groups, which are represented by a two letter code. This code is based on the French version of the descriptors. Each main group can be divided into thirty-four subgroups which are represented both by the digits 1 to 9 and the letters A to Z (‘I’ was omitted in order to avoid confusion). The result is a three character code of high mnemonic value, especially since the third character is inheritable in meaning.
909	Lapponica	http://finto.fi/lapponica/	Lapponica thesaurus is within Rovaniemi library's decades-edited a special vocabulary that is used to Lapland collection and the wider pohjoiskalottikokoelman for indexing. A special feature thesaurus is especially terminology in relation to the Sami people. The reason for drawing up Special Case glossary has been the need for the terms that have been difficult to describe the more general subject headings form. Thesauruses is involved also the wider Arctic region and words related somewhat to the northern Finno-Ugric kindred peoples of terms.
91	Canadian Thesaurus of Construction Science and Technology		There are 15,331 files in the TC/CS. Most of the descriptor terms in the TC/CS are in plural form (i.e. cars). The thesaurus uses the convention: if you can answer the question 'how much ____?' (how much rain), then the term will be listed in the singular form. If you can answer the question 'how many ____?' (i.e. how many cars), then it will be listed in the plural form. If you are unsure, then append a '*' wildcard to the desired words in your search strategy; for example 'survey*'. There are 15,331 files in the TC/CS. Each of the descriptor terms in the electronic TC.CS are contained in a self-standing file. That is, a term such as 'thesaurus' is stored in a file named 'thesaurus.html', and the BT,WT,NT, etc. are external crosslinks contained in the file. In all cases, any CTCS descriptor can only point to a BT, GT or WT that is one level above, or a NT or PT that is one level below, or a RT or AT that is on the same level. There are 10 levels in this hierarchy, going from terms such as 'Knowledge' and 'Research' at the top level down to the nuts and bolts at the bottom level.
910	General Finnish Ontology	http://finto.fi/yso/	"General Finnish Upper Ontology YSO is a trilingual ontology consisting mainly of general concepts. YSO has been founded on the basis of concepts in Finnish cultural sphere. As an indexing tool it is best applicable when indexed material is interdiscliplinary and its themes vary to a great extent. YSO's hierarchical construction is founded on parent-child relationships. In addition to this, some concepts are supplemented with associative and part-whole relations. Each concept in YSO is issued to at least one thematic group and some concepts have also been grouped with a non-hierarchical collection label (such as ""clothes by materials""). Following the international standards for thesauri, the terms for concepts are usually plural nouns. Terms in singular are usually mass nouns or terms referring to actions or abstract concepts. Some terms carry a different meaning when used in plural and in singular. For example, ballet refers to an art form and ballets to individual works of art. YSO is based on General Finnish Thesaurus (YSA) and General Finnish Thesaurus in Swedish (Allärs). Concepts in YSO and concepts in YSA and Allärs have been linked to each other with equivalence relationships. YSO has also been linked to Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH)."

""This Standard presents guidelines and conventions for the contents, display, construction, testing, maintenance, and management of monolingual controlled vocabularies. This Standard focuses on controlled vocabularies that are used for the representation of content objects in knowledge organization systems including lists, synonym rings, taxonomies, and thesauri. This Standard should be regarded as a set of recommendations based on preferred techniques and procedures. Optional procedures are, however, sometimes described, e.g., for the display of terms in a controlled vocabulary. The primary purpose of vocabulary control is to achieve consistency in the description of content objects and to facilitate retrieval. Vocabulary control is accomplished by three principal methods: defining the scope, or meaning, of terms; using the equivalence relationship to link synonymous and nearly synonymous terms; and distinguishing among homographs."

94	The Cultural Objects Names Authority	http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/cona/	The focus of CONA is works cataloged in scholarly literature, museum collections, visual resources collections, archives, libraries, and indexing projects with a primary emphasis on art, architecture, or archaeology. There are many fields in CONA, however through titles/names (equivalence relationships), as well as hierarchical and associative relationships, the basic structure of CONA is that of a thesaurus in compliance with ISO and NISO standards. Although it may be displayed as a list, CONA is a hierarchical database; its trees branch from a root called Top of the CONA hierarchy (Subject_ID: 700000000). There may be multiple broader contexts, making CONA polyhierarchical. In addition to the hierarchical relationships (e.g., between a print and the larger volume to which it belongs), CONA has equivalence relationships (between equivalent titles/names) and associative relationships (e.g., between a sketch and the final work). The primary top divisions of CONA are the facets Built Work and Movable Work. With the exception of performance art, CONA records unique physical works. However, CONA may include works that were never built or that no longer exist, for example designs for a building that was not constructed or a work that has been destroyed. The primary users of the Getty vocabularies include museums, art libraries, archives, visual resource collection catalogers, bibliographic projects concerned with art, researchers in art and art history, and the information specialists who are dealing with the needs of these users. In addition, a significant number of users of the Getty vocabularies are students or members of the general public.

948	Multilingual Name Authority List		The multilingual authority table is a controlled vocabulary based on the language authority table. It contains language combinations used for catalogue purposes. The EU publications use two-character codes, the first two positions of the three-character authority code.  The codes are alphanumeric in order to not confuse with ISO codes that are strictly alphabetic.
949	Language Name Authority List		The Language authority table is a controlled vocabulary that lists concepts associated with languages. Its main scope is to support activities associated with publication process. The concepts included are correlated with the ISO 639 international standard. This standard is issued in several parts: ISO 639-1 contains strictly two alphabetic letters (alpha-2), ISO 639-2/B (B = bibliographic) is used for bibliographic purpose (alpha-3), ISO 639-2/T (T = terminology) is used for technical purpose (alpha-3), ISO 639-3 covers all the languages and macro-languages of the world (alpha-3); the values are compliant with ISO 639-2/T. If an authority code is needed for a language without assigned ISO code, an alphanumeric code is created in order to not confuse with ISO codes that are strictly alphabetic. Contributions to the Language authority table are accepted following a review made by EU Vocabularies team of the Publications Office of the EU. The Language authority table is maintained by the Publications Office of the European Union on the EU Vocabularies website.

951	Country Name Authority List	https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/dataset/-/resource?uri=http://publications.europa.eu/resource/dataset/country	"This country codes authority table is intended to provide a code related to the names of the countries – in a short and in a long form – in the 24 official languages of the European Union.These codes are used for the documentary metadata and may present slight differences with those used for the production of documents at a stylistic level. The ""Authority code"" relays on the ISO 3166-1/alpha-3 positions. If the ISO code doesn't exist, an alpha-numeric code is created. A traceability of this codes creation is ensured and historical relationships are also offered as from 1950 till now with the date(s) of event(s). A country code comparison is provided between ISO codes, IANA codes (Internet ccTLDS – Country-code Top-level Domains), and TIR (Transport International par la Route) Vehicle system codes. Codes marked in italic are obsolete and should not be used, excepted in the case of back-log work. ISO 3166 is the International standard for country codes. The purpose of ISO 3166 is to establish codes for the representation of names of countries. This standard exists in three forms: ISO 3166-1 (2006) contains a two-letter code which is recommended as the general purpose code, a three-letter code which has better mnenomic properties and a numeric-3 code which can be useful if script independence of the codes is important. ISO 3166-2 (2007) gives codes for the names of the principal subdivisions (e.g provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1. This code is based on the two-letter code element from ISO 3166-1 followed by a separator and a further string of up to three alphanumeric characters. ISO 3166-3 (1999) contains a four-letter code for those country names which have been deleted from ISO 3166-1 since its first publication in 1974. The code elements for formerly used country names have a length of four alphabetical characters (alpha-4 code elements). The ISO 3166-1 is also used by the EU Geonomenclature of the Statistical Office, the UN/LOCODE, the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Internet Assigned Authority Numbers (IANA) and more other organisations."

The Event AT is part of the core metadata used in the exchange between the institutions involved in the legal decision making process and the Publications Office of the European Union. It is also used by EUR-Lex. It provides an authority code, the start-use date of the concept and labels in all official EU languages. Codes in italic are deprecated and should not be used, except in the case of back-log work. The Event AT is under governance of the Interinstitutional Metadata Maintenance Committee (IMMC) and maintained by the Publications Office of the European Union on EU Vocabularies website.
954	Corporate bodies Name Authority List		"The Corporate bodies name authority list (NAL) or Common Authority Table (CAT) is a controlled vocabulary listing corporate entities such as European institutions and bodies with their authority code and label(s) in the 24 official languages of the EU (when available).

They are classified accordingly in ""EU"" | ""INT (for international)"" | ""Other"". The traceability of the chronological modifications is ensured when possible. For the EU Corporate bodies, the legal basis is also indicated, as far as they are known. As the official languages have changed over the time, the translations are provided in the existing official languages for a given period. The names are provided under the labels and in a longer form (e.g. Committee of the Regions | Committee of the Regions of the European Union). A bi-directional vertical relationship shows how the entities are connected in a parent-child relationship. A bi-directional horizontal relationship is establish between the entities, starting at a given date and, if the case occurs, the link to the successor and the predecessor."
955	Authorized Osteopathic Thesaurus	http://www.aacom.org/news-and-events/publications/osteopathic-thesaurus	Recently, various groups within the osteopathic profession discovered that the current sources of osteopathic terminology were inadequate to meet their needs. They determined that, especially in the digital age, an authoritative osteopathic thesaurus was essential to the increasing number of professional activities requiring accurate, consistent descriptive terminology. (...) The Authorized Osteopathic Thesaurus (AOT) is the official thesaurus for osteopathic medicine, defining the meaning and interrelationships of those terms that have a unique meaning in osteopathic medicine. The goal of the AOT is to standardize the unique diagnostic, therapeutic, and theoretical concepts and terminology of osteopathic philosophy, principles and practice. The Thesaurus includes the preferred form of each term; its definition; references as needed to broader, narrower, and related terms; synonyms; and archaic forms of the term. Abbreviations and acronyms are also included. This first edition of the AOT is derived in part from the September 2003 edition of the Glossary of osteopathic terminology.Published biannually by the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine's Educational Council on Osteopathic Principles (ECOP) since 1981, the Glossary was the largest pre-existing authoritative source of osteopathic terms. The other primary source was the OSTMED ® subject authority file and bibliographic index to the literature of osteopathic medicine. The 2004 Edition is the first edition of the AOT. We anticipate regularly updating and revising the AOT. Future editions will include more terms and reflect further development of modern osteopathic teaching. This edition consists of: Total Number of Terms 471, Uniquely Osteopathic Terms 240, MeSH Terms 27, Non-Preferred Terms (Synonyms) 231.

957	Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System	http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm	The Harmonized System is an international nomenclature for the classification of products. It allows participating countries to classify traded goods on a common basis for customs purposes. At the international level, the Harmonized System (HS) for classifying goods is a six-digit code system. The HS comprises approximately 5,300 article/product descriptions that appear as headings and subheadings, arranged in 99 chapters, grouped in 21 sections. The six digits can be broken down into three parts. The first two digits (HS-2) identify the chapter the goods are classified in, e.g. 09 = Coffee, Tea, Maté and Spices. The next two digits (HS-4) identify groupings within that chapter, e.g. 09.02 = Tea, whether or not flavoured. The next two digits (HS-6) are even more specific, e.g. 09.02.10 Green tea (not fermented)... Up to the HS-6 digit level, all countries classify products in the same way (a few exceptions exist where some countries apply old versions of the HS). The Harmonized System was introduced in 1988 and has been adopted by most of the countries worldwide. It has undergone several changes in the classification of products. These changes are called revisions and happened in 1996, 2002 and 2007.

965	National Vegetation Classification	http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-4259	The National Vegetation Classification (NVC) is one of the key common standards developed for the country nature conservation agencies. The original project aimed to produce a comprehensive classification and description of the plant communities of Britain, each systematically named and arranged and with standardised descriptions for each.  It was originally commissioned in 1975 by the Nature Conservancy Council (NCC) and was intended as a new classification, not an attempt to fit British plant communities into some existing scheme derived from elsewhere in Europe. The general approach adopted was phytosociological and, therefore, concentrated on the rigorous recording of floristic data. It did, nevertheless, try to avoid over-scrupulous selection of samples, rejection of awkward data and preoccupation with the hierarchical taxonomy of vegetation types.
966	New Zealand Threat Classification System	http://www.doc.govt.nz/publications/conservation/nz-threat-classification-system/	The New Zealand Threat Classification System's long-term goal is to list all extant species that exist here according to their threat of extinction.

967	North American Product Classification System	http://www.census.gov/eos/www/napcs/	In February 1999, the statistical agencies of Canada, Mexico, and the United States launched a joint multi-phase initiative (...) to develop a comprehensive demand-oriented product classification system to complement the new supply-oriented industry classification system introduced in 1997. The industry classification system is known as the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS); the product classification is known as the North American Product Classification System (NAPCS). The long-term objective of NAPCS is to develop a market-oriented, or demand-based, hierarchical classification system for products (goods and services) that (a) is not industry-of-origin based but can be linked to the NAICS industry structure, (b) is consistent across the three NAICS countries, and (c) promotes improvements in the identification and classification of service products across international classification systems, such as the Central Product Classification System of the United Nations. (...) The products developed under Phases I - III are assembled into 102 product lists that identify and define the significant products produced by about 370 US service industries. These lists include 98 that are at the trilateral level; three at the bilateral level (US and Mexico for NAICS 55-Management of Companies and Enterprises, NAICS 621210-Offices of Dentists, and NAICS 621610-Home Health Care Services); and one at the US-only level (for NAICS 621-2 (except 6212, 6, and 9)-Health Care Services of Physicians, Health Care Practitioners (except Dentists) and Hospitals). Product lines developed from all 102 lists were incorporated into product collection forms developed for the 2007 and 2012 Economic Censuses, and they are being incorporated incrementally into the Service Annual Survey (beginning in 2001).
968	American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System	http://www.asahq.org/resources/clinical-information/asa-physical-status-classification-system	The purpose of the grading system is simply to assess the degree of a patient’s 'sickness' or 'physical state' prior to selecting the anesthetic or prior to performing surgery. Describing patients’ preoperative physical status is used for recordkeeping, for communicating between colleagues, and to create a uniform system for statistical analysis. The grading system is not intended for use as a measure to predict operative risk.

970	International Standard Classification of Occupations	http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/	ISCO is a tool for organizing jobs into a clearly defined set of groups according to the tasks and duties undertaken in the job. Its main aims are to provide: a basis for the international reporting, comparison and exchange of statistical and administrative data about occupations; a model for the development of national and regional classifications of occupations; and a system that can be used directly in countries that have not developed their own national classifications. It is intended for use in statistical applications and in a variety of client oriented applications. Client oriented applications include the matching of job seekers with job vacancies, the management of short or long term migration of workers between countries and the development of vocational training programmes and guidance. The first version of ISCO was adopted in 1957 by the Ninth International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS). It is known as ISCO-58. This version was superseded by ISCO-68, which was adopted by the Eleventh ICLS in 1966. The third version, ISCO-88, was adopted by the Fourteenth ICLS in 1987. Many current national occupational classifications are based on one of these three ISCO versions. ISCO has recently been updated to take into account developments in the world of work since 1988 and to make improvements in light of experience gained in using ISCO-88. The updating did not change the basic principles and top structure of ISCO-88 but significant structural changes were made in some areas. The updated classification was adopted in December 2007 and is known as ISCO-08. Many countries are now updating their national classification either based on ISCO-08 or to improve alignment with the new international statistical standard.
971	Nursing Interventions Classification		"The Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) is a comprehensive, research-based, standardized classification of interventions that nurses perform. It is useful for clinical documentation, communication of care across settings, integration of data across systems and settings, effectiveness research, productivity measurement, competency evaluation, reimbursement, and curricular design. The Classification includes the interventions that nurses do on behalf of patients, both independent and collaborative interventions, both direct and indirect care. An intervention is defined as ""any treatment, based upon clinical judgment and knowledge, that a nurse performs to enhance patient/client outcomes."" While an individual nurse will have expertise in only a limited number of interventions reflecting on her or his specialty, the entire classification captures the expertise of all nurses. NIC can be used in all settings (from acute care intensive care units, to home care, to hospice, to primary care) and all specialties (from critical care to ambulatory care and long term care). While the entire classification describes the domain of nursing, some of the interventions in the classification are also done by other providers. NIC can be used by other non-physician providers to describe their treatments. NIC interventions include both the physiological (e.g. Acid-Base Management) and the psychosocial (e.g. Anxiety Reduction). Interventions are included for illness treatment (e.g. Hyperglycemia Management), illness prevention (e.g. Fall Prevention), and health promotion (e.g. Exercise Promotion). Most of the interventions are for use with individuals but many are for use with families (e.g. Family Integrity Promotion), and some are for use with entire communities (e.g. Environmental Management: Community). Indirect care interventions (e.g. Supply Management) are also included. Each intervention as it appears in the classification is listed with a label name, a definition, a set of activities to carry out the intervention, and background readings. The 554 interventions in NIC (6th ed.) are grouped into thirty classes and seven domains for ease of use. (...) Each intervention has a unique number (code). The classification is continually updated with an ongoing process for feedback and review. In the back of the book, there are instructions for how users can submit suggestions for modifications to existing interventions or propose a new intervention. All contributors whose changes are included in the next edition are acknowledged in the book. New editions of the classification are planned for approximately every 5 years. The classification was first published in 1992, the second edition in 1996, the third edition in 2000, the fourth edition in 2004, the fifth edition in 2008, and the 6th edition in 2013."
972	Nursing Outcomes Classification	http://www.rncasemanager.com/articles/NursingOutcomesClassificationLabelsDefinitions.pdf	The Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC) is a comprehensive, standardized classification of patient/client outcomes developed to evaluate the effects of interventions provided by nurses or other health care professionals. Standardized outcomes are essential for documentation in electronic records, for use in clinical information systems, for the development of nursing knowledge and the education of professional nurses. An outcome is a measurable individual, family, or community state, behavior or perception that is measured along a continuum and is responsive to nursing interventions. The outcomes are developed for use in all settings and with all patient populations. Clinical sites used to test the NOC included tertiary care hospitals, community hospitals, community agencies, nursing centers, and a nursing home. The outcomes are developed for use in all settings and can be used across the care continuum to follow patient outcomes throughout an illness episode or over an extended period of care. Since the outcomes describe patient/client status, other disciplines may find them useful for the evaluation of their interventions. The 490 outcomes in Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC) (5th ed.) are listed in alphabetical order. Each outcome has a definition, a list of indicators that can be used to evaluate patient status in relation to the outcome, a target outcome rating, scale(s) to measure patient status, and a short list of references used in the development and refinement of the outcome. A five-point Likert scale is used with all outcomes and indicators. A rating of a '5' is always the best possible score and '1' is always the worst possible score. Examples of measurement scales used with the outcomes are: 1=Extremely compromised to 5= Not compromised and 1=Never demonstrated to 5=Consistently demonstrated. The NOC outcomes are grouped in a coded taxonomy that organizes the outcomes within a conceptual framework to facilitate identifying an outcome. The 490 outcomes are grouped into thirty-two classes and seven domains for ease of use. The seven domains are: Functional Health, Physiologic Health, Psychosocial Health, Health Knowledge & Behavior, Perceived Health, Family Health, and Community Health. Each outcome has a unique code number that facilitates its use in computerized clinical information systems and allows manipulation of data to answer questions about nursing care quality and effectiveness. The classification is continually updated to include new outcomes and to revise outcomes based on new research or user feedback.
973	Human Genome Project Glossary	http://web.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/glossary.shtml	The Human Genome Project (HGP) was an international 13-year effort, 1990 to 2003. Primary goals were to discover the complete set of human genes and make them accessible for further biological study, and determine the complete sequence of DNA bases in the human genome.
974	AlgaeBase Taxonomy	http://www.algaebase.org/browse/taxonomy/	You can browse though the hierarchy by clicking on the names below and drilling down. At each level the numbers of current species are given for each taxon. Only currently accepted names are currently included. Should you find any errors, please click on the little envelope icon, and you can send me an e-mail via the site. In order to make calculations of the numbers of species of living algae, note that 68 or so species of flowering plants (seagrasses) are included for the present (under the Phylum Magnoliophyta), and about 2000 fossil algae, mainly calcium- and silica- secreting forms. A few fungal names are included. We are currently revising the classification to take account of some recent phylogenetic studies; however, because of difficulties with the Botanical and Zoological Codes, this may seem very inconsistent in places. Plants vs Animals The age-old question of what is an animal and what is a plant creates classification problems for botanists and zoologists alike, and in many groups the differences are quite unclear. The classification of organisms currently included in AlgaeBase adopted here closely follows a draft classification by Dennis Gordon (Principal Scientist, Aquatic Biodiversity & Biosecurity, National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research, Wellington, New Zealand) and colleagues (including AlgaeBase) in July 2011, with the exception of the euglenoid flagellates and the dinoflagellates for which AlgaeBase has mostly retained the ICBN (botanical) suffixes; however, we have occasionally added the equivalent taxa in zoology. We have largely adopted this classification for the sake of conformity. Flowering Plants For the marine flowering plants we follow Angiosperm Phylogeny Group III system in respect of the Angiosperms in which all seagrasses are in one order, the Alismatales. The family Cymodoceaceae is not recognised currently in this system, but we have retained it for the present. The seagrasses are, of course, not algae, but are included here for convenience.

The taxonomic portion of GRIN provides the classification and nomenclature for these genetic resources and many other economic plants on a worldwide basis. Included in GRIN TAXONOMY are scientific names for 26,968 genera (14,279 accepted) and 1,375 infragenera (1,316 accepted) and 103,161 species or infraspecies (61,241 accepted) with common names, geographical distributions, literature references, and economic impacts. Generally recognized standards for abbreviating author's names and botanical literature have been adopted in GRIN. The scientific names are verified, in accordance with the international rules of botanical nomenclature, by taxonomists of the National Germplasm Resources Laboratory using available taxonomic literature and consultations with taxonomic specialists. Included in GRIN TAXONOMY are federal- and state-regulated noxious weeds and federally and internationally listed threatened and endangered plants.

977	Multilingual Property Thesaurus	http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/x2038f/x2038f00.htm	"In 1999, FAO published the first French version of the multilingual land tenure thesaurus. Its main purpose was to be put to the test of the ground, that is to say, subject to constructive criticism from users Search for new information and insights from land experts, both in terms of substance and form, a number of strengths and gaps have been identified since 1999 by the editorial team and Many other land specialists, and this second version takes into account as much as possible these returns from the land, while the ""land"" discipline, like the disciplines that nourish it, is constantly evolving and a period of five years Can certainly be considered sufficiently long to perceive mutations or trends in the conceptual bases as well as in the approaches.This also justifies the draft of a later version As it also announces the draft of a third version. More than forty new terms have thus been added as main entry or as secondary entry. About the same number of terms have also been completed and exemplified. References to websites where additional information or illustrations can be found are also included. Finally, it is important to mention the recent edition of the 2003 and 2003 versions of the thesaurus, which, more than mere translations of the French version, are real adaptations to the geographic and cultural worlds of Spanish and English. This second French version of course benefited from the editorial experience gained with the preparation of the Spanish and English versions. A Chinese version was also released very recently."

979	FAO Glossary of Biotechnology for Food and Agriculture	http://www.fao.org/biotech/biotech-glossary/	The 'Glossary of Biotechnology for Food and Agriculture' is a revised, augmented version of the 'Glossary of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering' published by FAO in 1999. The idea for such a collection of terminology associated with the rapidly expanding fields related to or deriving from biotechnology and genetic engineering, was stimulated by the difficulty of communicating effectively in discussions at intergovernmental level. On various occasions, simple differences of interpretation of terminology have threatened to de-rail negotiations of international importance. This Glossary tries to provide a consolidated, comprehensive and yet accessible list of terms and acronyms that are used regularly in biotechnology for food and agriculture and that represent a convenient reference source for researchers, students and technicians. (...) The second edition contained 3,196 terms and related definitions (about 450 new terms, about 100 terms were deleted). A number of definitions were improved to enhance the coherence of the Glossary. The second edition also has a slightly modified title, that reflects more precisely the scope of the Glossary, limited to terms involving biotechnology for food and agriculture. (...) However, FAO does not consider that the process is completed, and inputs from users (suggestions of new terms, comments on current terms, etc.) are encouraged. The new glossary management system introduced in 2012 allows the addition of new terms and definitions as well as their simultaneous translation into Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian, and Spanish, enabling us to keep pace with new developments in the fast progressing field of agricultural biotechnologies.

980	Glossary of terms on livestock manure management	http://www.ramiran.net/DOC/Glossary2003.pdf	Manure management, utilisation and the potential impacts on the environment are topics of high relevance across Europe. It is well recognised that internationally coordinated research and development and exchange of experience can greatly benefit science, technology transfer and the development of the corresponding policy framework across Europe. A major handicap in international collaboration, and a major source of misunderstandings, in these areas is the lack of a standardised terminology. This is not only true for the translation between different languages but also within most languages. (...) The glossary comprises mainly terms concerning manures produced by farm livestock but also includes relevant, broader terms concerning fertilisers, crops, feeding livestock and wider environmental issues. There are also some terms concerning other types of organic materials that are commonly applied to agricultural land. Similarly, although it is primarily a glossary of terms used in Europe, some terms in common use in North America are included.
981	Thesaulangue	https://apps.atilf.fr/revues/thesaulangue.pdf	Thesaulangue is above all a documentary tool for scientific indexing, a homogenization of the linguistic indexing on the terminological level, intended to facilitate all bibliographic searches and to promote the relevance of the results of an automated request on the bibliographic database of Documentation and futures center on HAL (hyper online article) which provides an interface allowing authors to deposit manuscripts of scientific articles in all disciplines on the basis of the CCSD (Center for Direct Scientific Communication - UPS 2275). (...) Thesaulangue must be understood by the linguistic community as a terminological reserve of the history of epistemological approaches, such as the conservatory of valuable data accumulated in the course of research, as a place of living memory offered to Future researchers.

988	Thesaurus of Industrial Technology and Applied Sciences	http://www-biblio.inti.gov.ar/index.php	The Thesaurus of Industrial Technology and Applied Sciences developed in the Technical Processes Sector of the INTI Library began to be compiled in 1981, starting with the terminology proper to the monographic works of the technical staff of the Institute.After a first collection Of terms, the respective hierarchical and horizontal relationships mentioned above were compared by comparing the terms selected with their equivalents in other thesauri (eg Root Thesaurus (BSI), Macrothesaurus (OECD), Thesaurus of Engineering and Scientific Terms ), Agrovoc (FAO), FSTA thesaurus, and others), as well as new terms from the books and monographic series found in the bibliographic database of the Library The descriptors or keywords thus compiled were recorded in a Microisis support database. With respect to the thematic areas it covers, they correspond fundamentally to The branches of industrial technology, applied sciences and related areas, covering basically the subjects in which INTI deploys its research, development and technical assistance activities.  Currently the Thesaurus gathers about 5400 descriptors, although it should be mentioned that the update is continuous given that as new material is incorporated, new terms are emerging, which, after an evaluation, are included with the same methodology.
989	Librarianship and Documentation Thesaurus	http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/30255/1/Tesauro%20de%20Biblioteconomia%20y%20Documentacion.pdf	The first version of this Thesaurus of Library and Documentation was published three years ago, specifically in the spring of 2002. Since its publication, this thesaurus has been used in the indexing tasks of the various CINDOC databases and in the Assignment of materials of the articles collected in the journal portal Temaria, which allowed to gather the comments and suggestions of the specialized staff on the terminology used and its hierarchical presentation.These suggestions have served to better develop the version now presented . With respect to the one presented in 2002, in the present version of the Thesaurus of Library and Documentation the following changes have been made: the number of terms in the different thematic areas has increased; Some terms have been relocated in the alphabetical and hierarchical indexes; The presentation of some descriptors has been modified; And more outreach notes have been added to better determine the meaning and use of the terms. A new annex has also been added with the Spanish and Catalan equivalents of the descriptors.
99	The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Taxonomy		The IEEE Taxonomy comprises the first three hierarchical 'levels' under each term-family (or branch) that is formed from the top-most terms of the IEEE Thesaurus. In this document these term-families are arranged alphabetically and denoted by boldface type. Each term family's hierarchy goes to no more than three sublevels, denoted by indents (grouping of four dots) preceding the next level terms. A term can appear in more than one hierarchical branch and can appear more than once in any particular hierarchy. The IEEE Taxonomy is defined in this way so that it is always a subset of the IEEE Thesaurus. The IEEE Thesaurus is a tool to improve and enhance the indexing and retrieval of articles and other material from IEEE periodicals, conferences, standards, and other publications that are made available on IEEE Xplore. It provides a common and consistent language for authors, researchers and online discovery.
990	Thesaurus of Animal Biology	http://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/32544	The ICYT Thesaurus of Animal Biology, developed within the framework of this project, was born from the concrete need to standardize, update and structure the scientific terms used for documentary analysis in the field of Animal Biology.There is no other thesaurus on this This option was more appropriate than the translation and adaptation of a thesaurus in a foreign language, because it was better adapted to the specific needs of that database. As the first results in the development of the thesaurus, were presented at the 46th IDF Congress and Conference, held in Madrid in October 1992. The appearance of this thesaurus presents a multiple interest. On the one hand, it is the first thesaurus on Animal Biology created in Spanish language, and represents an advance in the standardization of scientific terminology in Spanish. Secondly, since it was developed from the documentary language of the ICYT database, it has a practical and immediate practical application, since its implementation in the DBMS facilitates both the documentary analysis and the recovery of the scientific literature Spanish in this field. Finally, it provides documentalists, researchers and users in general with a reference frame of reference and a tool that makes the process of retrieving information from bibliographic databases more user-friendly, while increasing the relevance of such retrieval. The presentation of a scientific work, of the characteristics of the present, generally implies an invitation to make a recapitulation about the avatars that, during its gestation, have been taking place, and the perspectives and future projects related to The same, which, in a necessarily schematic form, will constitute the basic content of this presentation.

997	Italian thesaurus of Earth Sciences	http://www.isprambiente.gov.it/contentfiles/00000000/26-143650-thist.pdf	The objective of creating an Italian thesaurus of earth sciences stems from the desire to do justice to terminology and documentary complexity of our prestigious national heritage, muffled still largely imported from indexing tools and therefore often improper. Such an objective presented at the same time an ambitious and conscious challenge, as it means, resources and expertise, as anything but discounted amount, formed intermediate battles to win for the 'dream realization'. Now the Thist was finally realized with the help of many, technicians and scholars have directed their patient work and their backgrounds in order to collectively prepostoci. The Thist, born precisely at random from the conviction of the need to do justice to the vast and rich Italian expertise in a specific and crucial scientific sector, see today, to the satisfaction of those who have taken care of growth and development, its publication. Being an instrument in constant evolution as a thesaurus, it also wants to be the first of other issues that will follow. We believe we can reasonably say that will be a valuable tool not only for experts, but also for those working in the world of conservation and dissemination of documentary material. (...) At present the Thist presents 10350 103850 descriptors linked by hierarchical relations, membership and equivalence.

999	International Development Research Centre Library Thesaurus	https://idl-bnc-idrc.dspacedirect.org/bitstream/handle/10625/837/IDL-837.pdf	When the IDRC Library began to index the material in its collection and to build a data base using the ISIS computer systems, the OECD's Macrothesaurus was selected as the source of descriptors for indexing and retrieval. At that time it was hoped that the international and other organizations also using the Macrothesaurus would construct a joint operation to keep it up to date and to modify it in the light of experience. These hopes have not so far been realized, and, while there have been considerable ad hoc consultations among some of the major users of the Macrothesaurus, each has had to make modifications unilaterally to meet individual requirements. IDRC's policy has been to stay as close as possible to the Macrothesaurus, and to make changes only when necessary. Nevertheless, hundreds of changes in matters of detail have had to be introduced over the years since operations began; the original structure of the Macrothesaurus has, however, been retained.
