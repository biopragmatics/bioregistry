\caption{An overview on registries covering biomedical ontologies, controlled vocabularies, and databases. A ✓ means the field is required. A ● means it is part of the schema, but not required or incomplete on some entries. A blank cell means that it is not part of the metadata schema. The FAIR column denotes that a structured dump of the data is easily findable, accessible, and in a structured format in bulk. For lookup services, some fields (i.e., Example ID, Default Provider, Alternate Providers) are omitted because inclusion would be redundant. The search column means there is a URL into which a search query can be formatted to show a list of results. The provider column means there is a URL into which a prefix can be formatted to show a dedicated page for its metadata. *Caveats: Several of Wikidata's fields can be accessed indirectly with alternative SPARQL queries. BioPortal's data is locked behind an API that requires a key and has rate limited access. The Crop Ontology Curation Tool does not list homepages because it is the homepage itself. Non-english language registries in the OntoPortal Alliance were not included.}
