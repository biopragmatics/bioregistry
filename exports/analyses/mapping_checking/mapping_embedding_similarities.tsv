opm	fairsharing	FAIRsharing.7c683b	Open Provenance Model The Open Provenance Model (OPM) is a model of provenance that is designed to meet the following requirements: (1) To allow provenance information to be exchanged between systems, by means of a compatibility layer based on a shared provenance model. (2) To allow developers to build and share tools that operate on such a provenance model. (3) To define provenance in a precise, technology-agnostic manner. (4) To support a digital representation of provenance for any 'thing', whether produced by computer systems or not. (5) To allow multiple levels of description to coexist. (6) To define a core set of rules that identify the valid inferences that can be made on provenance representation. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2010.07.005	name,description,homepage	0.14568454027175903

dicom	fairsharing	FAIRsharing.b7z8by	Digital Imaging and COmmunications in Medicine DICOM — Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine — is the international standard for medical images and related information (ISO 12052). It defines the formats for medical images that can be exchanged with the data and quality necessary for clinical use. DICOM is implemented in almost every radiology, cardiology imaging, and radiotherapy device (X-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound, etc.), and increasingly in devices in other medical domains such as ophthalmology and dentistry. With tens of thousands of imaging devices in use, DICOM is one of the most widely deployed healthcare messaging standards in the world. There are literally billions of DICOM images currently in use for clinical care. Since its first publication in 1993, DICOM has revolutionized the practice of radiology, allowing the replacement of X-ray film with a fully digital workflow. Much as the Internet has become the platform for new consumer information applications, DICOM has enabled advanced medical imaging applications that have “changed the face of clinical medicine”. From the emergency department, to cardiac stress testing, to breast cancer detection, DICOM is the standard that makes medical imaging work — for doctors and for patients. http://medical.nema.org/	name,description,homepage	0.43441957235336304

ogms	bartoc	216	"BFO grows out of a philosophical orientation which overlaps with that of DOLCE and SUMO. Unlike these, however, it is narrowly focused on the task of providing a genuine upper ontology which can be used in support of domain ontologies developed for scientific research, as for example in biomedicine within the framework of the OBO Foundry. Thus BFO does not contain physical, chemical, biological or other terms which would properly fall within the special sciences domains.

The BFO project was initiated in 2002. The theory behind BFO was developed initially by Barry Smith and Pierre Grenon and presented in a series of publications listed here. Since then important contributions to BFO have been made by many people, including: Werner Ceusters, Chris Mungall, Fabian Neuhaus, Holger Stenzhorn, Alan Ruttenberg, Mathias Brochausen, Bjoern Peters, Kerry Trentelman, and by more than hundred other members of the BFO Discussion Group. Its development has been carried out under the auspices of the project Forms of Life sponsored by the Volkswagen Foundation. http://www.ifomis.org/bfo/"	description,homepage	0.44455575942993164

The sequencing of several bird genomes and the anticipated sequencing of many more provided the impetus to develop a model organism database devoted to the taxonomic class: Aves. Birds provide model organisms important to the study of neurobiology, immunology, genetics, development, oncology, virology, cardiovascular biology, evolution and a variety of other life sciences. Many bird species are also important to agriculture, providing an enormous worldwide food source worldwide. Genomic approaches are proving invaluable to studying traits that affect meat yield, disease resistance, behavior, and bone development along with many other factors affecting productivity. In this context, BirdBase will serve both biomedical and agricultural researchers. http://birdbase.arizona.edu/birdbase/"	name,description,homepage	0.4512290954589844

gemet	bartoc	16	"General Multilingual Environmental Thesaurus The basic idea for the development of GEMET was to use the best of the presently available excellent multilingual thesauri, in order to save time, energy and funds. GEMET was conceived as a 'general' thesaurus, aimed to define a common general language, a core of general terminology for the environment. Specific thesauri and descriptor systems (e.g. on Nature Conservation, on Wastes, on Energy, etc.) have been excluded from the first step of development of the thesaurus and have been taken into account only for their structure and upper level terminology. The merging has been performed both on conceptual and formal basis. Coinciding concepts in the different thesauri have been identified and scored. Like in other multilingual thesauri, e. g. Infoterra EnVoc, a neutral alphanumerical notation allows the identification of a concept independently on the user's language.

The links with the original thesauri are ensured by the respective identifiers or code notations. Following the identification of the coinciding concepts, a selection was made by the experts of the National Focal Points of the organisations involved. The resulting 6.562 terms have been arranged in a classification scheme made of 3 super-groups, 30 groups plus 5 accessory, instrumental groups. Each descriptor has been arranged in a hierarchical structure headed by a Top Term. The level of poly-hierarchy, i.e. the allocation of a descriptor to more than one group, has been kept to a minimum. Further, to allow a thematic retrieval of terms thematically related but scattered in different groups, a set of 40 themes have been agreed upon with the EEA and each descriptor has been assigned to as many themes as necessary. Thus, the user can access the thesaurus through the group- hierarchical list, through the thematic list or through the alphabetical list. As a complement to the hierarchical 'vertical' relations, an exhaustive series of strong 'horizontal' relations between terms (RT, Related Terms) have been introduced. A progressive Line Number has been assigned to each descriptor of the systematic list, in order to help the user of the lists to identify the descriptor in the different lists. The Line Number is merely a neutral identifier for the present version. The GEMET size, formerly figured at about 200000 descriptors, rose to more than 5.000 in the course of merging, due to the limited overlapping between the different thesauri, to constraints of the selection work carried out by the parental organisations and to a few new additions, mainly from CDS indexing work. The present version 2001* of GEMET is the result of a close collaboration between CNR and UBA under contract and supervision of the ETC/CDS. It presents 5.298 descriptors, including 109 Top Terms, and 1.264 synonyms in English. The 5.524 terms belonging to the parental thesauri and not included in GEMET, constitute an accessory alphabetical list of free terms. GEMET has been developed as an indexing, retrieval and control tool for the European Topic Centre on Catalogue of Data Sources (ETC/CDS) and the European Environment Agency (EEA), Copenhagen. http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/"	name,description,homepage	0.45830976963043213

LIPID Metabolites And Pathways Strategy (LIPID MAPS®) is a multi-institutional effort created in 2003 to identify and quantitate, using a systems biology approach and sophisticated mass spectrometers, all of the major — and many minor — lipid species in mammalian cells, as well as to quantitate the changes in these species in response to perturbation.
The ultimate goal of our research is to better understand lipid metabolism and the active role lipids play in diabetes, stroke, cancer, arthritis, Alzheimer's and other lipid-based diseases in order to facilitate development of more effective treatments.
Since our inception, we have made great strides toward defining the ""lipidome"" (an inventory of the thousands of individual lipid molecular species) in the mouse macrophage. We have also worked to make lipid analysis easier and more accessible for the broader scientific community and to advance a robust research infrastructure for the international research community.

ucum	bartoc	1895	"Unified Code for Units of Measure The Unified Code for Units of Measure is a code system intended to include all units of measures being contemporarily used in international science, engineering, and business. The purpose is to facilitate unambiguous electronic communication of quantities together with their units. The focus is on electronic communication, as opposed to communication between humans. A typical application of The Unified Code for Units of Measure are electronic data interchange (EDI) protocols, but there is nothing that prevents it from being used in other types of machine communication. How does it relate?

The Unified Code for Units of Measure is inspired by and heavily based on ISO 2955-1983, ANSI X3.50-1986, and HL7's extensions called ISO+. The respective ISO and ANSI standards are both entitled Representation of [...] units in systems with limited character sets where ISO 2955 refers to SI and other units provided by ISO 1000-1981, while ANSI X3.50 extends ISO 2955 to include U.S. customary units. Because these standards carry the restriction of limited character sets in their names they seem to be of less value today where graphical user interface and laser printers are in wide-spread use, which is why the european standard ENV 12435 in its clause 7.3 declares ISO 2955 obsolete.

ENV 12435 is dedicated exclusively to the communication of measurements between humans in display and print, and does not provide codes that can be used in communication between systems. It does not even provide a specification that would allow communication of units from one system to the screen or printer of another system. The issue about displaying units in the common style defined by the 9th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM) in 1947 is not just the character set. Although The Unicode Standard and its predecessor ISO/IEC 10646 is the richest character set ever it is still not enough to specify the presentation of units because there are important typographical details such as superscripts, subscripts, roman and italics.""

Several URI namespaces and encoding methods have been proposed to map UCUM codes to URIs. http://unitsofmeasure.org/"	name,description,homepage	0.5559923052787781

hpa	re3data	r3d100010931	The Human Protein Atlas The Swedish Human Protein Atlas project has been set up to allow for a systematic exploration of the human proteome using Antibody-Based Proteomics. This is accomplished by combining high-throughput generation of affinity-purified antibodies with protein profiling in a multitude of tissues and cells assembled in tissue microarrays. Confocal microscopy analysis using human cell lines is performed for more detailed protein localization. The program hosts the Human Protein Atlas portal with expression profiles of human proteins in tissues and cells.  The main objective of the resource centre is to produce specific antibodies to human target proteins using a high-throughput production method involving the cloning and protein expression of Protein Epitope Signature Tags (PrESTs). After purification, the antibodies are used to study expression profiles in cells and tissues and for functional analysis of the corresponding proteins in a wide range of platforms. https://www.proteinatlas.org/	name,description,homepage	0.6101906299591064

giardiadb	re3data	r3d100012458	"GiardiaDB Giardia lamblia is a significant, environmentally transmitted, human pathogen and an amitochondriate protist. It is a major contributor to the enormous worldwide burden of human diarrheal diseases, yet the basic biology of this parasite is not well understood. No virulence factor has been identified. The Giardia lamblia genome contains only 12 million base pairs distributed onto five chromosomes. Its analysis promises to provide insights about the origins of nuclear genome organization, the metabolic pathways used by parasitic protists, and the cellular biology of host interaction and avoidance of host immune systems.
Since the divergence of Giardia lamblia lies close to the transition between eukaryotes and prokaryotes in universal ribosomal RNA phylogenies, it is a valuable, if not unique, model for gaining basic insights into genetic innovations that led to formation of eukaryotic cells. In evolutionary terms, the divergence of this organism is at least twice as ancient as the common ancestor for yeast and man. A detailed study of its genome will provide insights into an early evolutionary stage of eukaryotic chromosome organization as well as other aspects of the prokaryotic / eukaryotic divergence. https://giardiadb.org/giardiadb/app"	name,description,homepage	0.6146448850631714

nlm	bartoc	528	National Library of Medicine Classification The NLM Classification covers the field of medicine and related sciences. The scheme is a system of classification intended to be used for the shelf arrangement of all library materials, regardless of format. Designed as a broad classification, it is suitable for both large and small library collections and may be adapted to handle specialized collections of any size. The NLM Classification is a system of mixed notation patterned after the Library of Congress (LC) Classification where alphabetical letters which denote broad subject categories are further subdivided by numbers. The NLM Classification utilizes schedules QS-QZ and W-WZ, permanently excluded from the LC Classification Schedules and is intended to be used with the LC schedules which supplement the NLM Classification for subjects bordering on medicine and for general reference materials. The LC schedules for Human Anatomy (QM), Microbiology (QR), and Medicine (R) are not used at all by the National Library of Medicine since they overlap the NLM Classification. The headings for the individual schedules are given in brief form (e.g., WE - Musculoskeletal System; WG - Cardiovascular System) and together they provide an outline of the subjects that constitute the NLM Classification. These headings are interpreted broadly and include the physiological system, the specialty or specialties connected with them, the regions of the body chiefly concerned and subordinate related fields. The Classification is hierarchical, and within each schedule, division by organ usually has priority. Each main schedule, as well as some sections within a schedule, begins with a group of form numbers ranging generally from 1-49 which are used to classify materials by publication type, e.g., dictionaries, atlases, laboratory manuals, etc. The main schedules QS-QZ, W-WY, and WZ (excluding WZ 220-270) are used to classify works published after 1913; the 19th century schedule is used for works published 1801-1913; and WZ 220-270 is used to provide century groupings for works published before 1801 and Americana. Geographic subdivision is provided for certain subjects in the NLM schedules by the application of Table G notations. http://www.nlm.nih.gov/class/	name,description,homepage	0.6229051947593689

nmr	ols	nmrcv	nuclear magnetic resonance CV This artefact is an MSI-approved controlled vocabulary primarily developed under COSMOS EU and PhenoMeNal EU governance. The nmrCV is supporting the nmrML XML format with standardized terms. nmrML is a vendor agnostic open access NMR raw data standard. Its primaly role is analogous to the mzCV for the PSI-approved mzML XML format. It uses BFO2.0 as its Top level. This CV was derived from two predecessors (The NMR CV from the David Wishart Group, developed by Joseph Cruz) and the MSI nmr CV developed by Daniel Schober at the EBI.  This simple taxonomy of terms (no DL semantics used) serves the nuclear magnetic resonance markup language (nmrML) with meaningful descriptors to amend the nmrML xml file with CV terms. Metabolomics scientists are encouraged to use this CV to annotrate their raw and experimental context data, i.e. within nmrML. The approach to have an exchange syntax mixed of an xsd and CV stems from the PSI mzML effort. The reason to branch out from an xsd into a CV is, that in areas where the terminology is likely to change faster than the nmrML xsd could be updated and aligned, an externally and decentrallised maintained CV can accompensate for such dynamics in a more flexible way. A second reason for this set-up is that semantic validity of CV terms used in an nmrML XML instance (allowed CV terms, position/relation to each other, cardinality) can be validated by rule-based proprietary validators:  By means of cardinality specifications and XPath expressions defined in an XML mapping file (an instances of the CvMappingRules.xsd ), one can define what ontology terms are allowed in a specific location of the data model. http://nmrml.org/cv/	name,description,homepage	0.6383678317070007

ec	bartoc	671	Enzyme Nomenclature By the late 1950's it had become evident that the nomenclature of enzymology, in the absence of any guiding authority, in a period when the number of known enzymes was increasing rapidly, was getting out of hand. The naming of enzymes by individual workers had proved far from satisfactory in practice. In many cases the same enzymes became known by several different names, while conversely the same name was sometimes given to different enzymes. Many of the names conveyed little or no idea of the nature of the reactions catalysed, and similar names were sometimes given to enzymes of quite different types. To meet this situation, various attempts to bring order into the general nomenclature of enzymes, or into that of particular groups of enzymes, were made by individuals or small groups of specialists, but none of the resulting nomenclatures met with general approval. (...) The Enzyme List in the sixth edition (1992) contains 3540 entries, of which 178 record enzymes which are now transferred elsewhere in the list, and 166 have been deleted completely. Thus the number of enzymes actually listed is 3196, an increase of 29% on the 1984 edition. https://www.abbexa.com/enzyme-commission-number	name,description,homepage	0.6412346363067627

ehdaa2	bioportal	EHDAA2	Human Developmental Anatomy Ontology, abstract version 2 A structured controlled vocabulary of stage-specific anatomical structures of the human. It has been designed to mesh with the mouse anatomy and incorporates each Carnegie stage of development (CS1-20). The abstract version of the human developmental anatomy ontology compresses all the tissues present over Carnegie stages 1-20 into a single hierarchy. The heart, for example, is present from Carnegie Stage 9 onwards and is thus represented by 12 EHDA IDs (one for each stage). In the abstract mouse, it has a single ID so that the abstract term given as just <i>heart</i> really means <i>heart (CS 9-20)</i>. Timing details will be added to the abstract version of the ontology in a future release. http://genex.hgu.mrc.ac.uk/	name,description,homepage	0.6506174802780151

As one of them, the Cassava Ontology is actively used and shared in different databases such as the BMS (Breeding Management system) of the IBP or the CassavaBase. Cassava, a major staple crop, is the main source of calories for 500 million people across the globe. A perennial woody shrub native to Latin America, cassava is primarily grown as an annual crop in the humid tropics. A cash crop as well as a subsistence crop, cassava's large edible starchy roots are a source of low-cost carbohydrates for millions. Cassava end products range from fresh roots cooked, boiled, baked or fried at the household level, to highly processed starch as a food additive. https://cropontology.org/term/CO_334:ROOT	name,description,homepage	0.6514160633087158

ec	fairsharing	FAIRsharing.rfLD2u	Enzyme Commission Number In its report in 1961, the first Enzyme Commission devised a system for enzyme classification that also serves as a basis for assigning code numbers. These code numbers, prefixed by EC, contain four elements separated by points / full stops and are now widely in use. The first number shows to which of the six main divisions (classes) the enzyme belongs and therefore identifies the class of reaction catalysed. The second number indicates the subclass, and generally contains information about the type of compound or group involved. The third figure gives the sub-subclass, which further specifies the type of reaction involved. The fourth figure is the serial number of the enzyme in its sub-subclass. https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/iubmb/enzyme/rules.html	name,description,homepage	0.6575438976287842

ncbitaxon	bartoc	509	"National Center for Biotechnology Information Taxonomy The NCBI Taxonomy database is a curated set of names and classifications for all of the organisms that are represented in GenBank. When new sequences are submitted to GenBank, the submission is checked for new organism names, which are then classified and added to the Taxonomy database. As of April 2003, there were 176,890 total taxa represented.

There are two main tools for viewing the information in the Taxonomy database: the Taxonomy Browser, and Taxonomy Entrez. Both systems allow searching of the Taxonomy database for names, and both link to the relevant sequence data. However, the Taxonomy Browser provides a hierarchical view of the classification (the best display for most casual users interested in exploring our classification), whereas Entrez Taxonomy provides a uniform indexing, search, and retrieval engine with a common mechanism for linking between the Taxonomy and other relevant Entrez databases.

Organismal taxonomy is a powerful organizing principle in the study of biological systems. Inheritance, homology by common descent, and the conservation of sequence and structure in the determination of function are all central ideas in biology that are directly related to the evolutionary history of any group of organisms. Because of this, taxonomy plays an important cross-linking role in many of the NCBI tools and databases.

The NCBITaxon ontology is an automatic translation of the NCBI taxonomy (a taxonomic classification of living organisms and associated artifacts) database into obo/owl. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy"	name,description,homepage	0.6682789325714111

A multi-axial classification of the site, morphology, behaviour, and grading of neoplasms. The topography axis uses the ICD-10 classification of malignant neoplasms (except those categories which relate to secondary neoplasms and to specified morphological types of tumours) for all types of tumours, thereby providing greater site detail for non-malignant tumours than is provided in ICD-10. In contrast to ICD-10, the ICD-O includes topography for sites of haematopoietic and reticuloendothelial tumours. The morphology axis provides five-digit codes ranging from M-8000/0 to M-9989/3. The first four digits indicate the specific histological term. The fifth digit after the slash (/) is the behaviour code, which indicates whether a tumour is malignant, benign, in situ, or uncertain (whether benign or malignant). A separate one-digit code is also provided for histologic grading (differentiation). http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/adaptations/oncology/"	name,description,homepage	0.6719011068344116

bel	fairsharing	FAIRsharing.dp0jvd	Biological Expression Language BEL is a language for representing scientific findings in the life sciences in a reusable, shareable, and computable form. BEL is designed to represent scientific findings by capturing causal and correlative relationships in context, where context can include information about the biological and experimental system in which the relationships were observed, the supporting publications cited and the process of curation. BEL is intended as a knowledge capture and interchange medium, supporting the operation of systems that integrate knowledge derived from independent efforts. The language is designed to be use-neutral, facilitating the storage and use of structured knowledge for inference by applications through a knowledge assembly process that can create computable biological networks. While BEL does not prescribe any particular assembly process or any particular knowledge format for the output of an assembly process, a suite of software components called the BEL Framework provides everything necessary to create, compile, assemble, and deliver computable knowledge models to BEL-aware applications. The current version of BEL provides the means to describe biological interactions qualitatively but not to quantify the magnitude or rate of these interactions. This limitation is by design because this quantitative information has significant variability and is not consistently reported in the literature. It is our hope that future versions of BEL can accommodate these additional data. https://bel.bio	name,description,homepage	0.6897962093353271

These authority data represent and describe entities, i.e. persons, corporate bodies, conferences and events, geographic entities, topics and works relating to cultural and academic collections. Libraries in particular use the GND to catalogue publications. However, archives, museums, cultural and academic institutions, and researchers involved in research projects are also increasingly working with the GND. Authority data make cataloguing easier, offer definitive search entries and forge links between different information resources. Every entity in the GND features a unique and stable identifier (GND ID). This makes it possible to link the authority data with both each other and external data sets and web resources.

cdao	agroportal	CDAO	Comparative Data Analysis Ontology The Comparative Data Analysis Ontology (CDAO) provides a framework for understanding data in the context of evolutionary-comparative analysis. This comparative approach is used commonly in bioinformatics and other areas of biology to draw inferences from a comparison of differently evolved versions of something, such as differently evolved versions of a protein. In this kind of analysis, the things-to-be-compared typically are classes called 'OTUs' (Operational Taxonomic Units). The OTUs can represent biological species, but also may be drawn from higher or lower in a biological hierarchy, anywhere from molecules to communities. The features to be compared among OTUs are rendered in an entity-attribute-value model sometimes referred to as the 'character-state data model'. For a given character, such as 'beak length', each OTU has a state, such as 'short' or 'long'. The differences between states are understood to emerge by a historical process of evolutionary transitions in state, represented by a model (or rules) of transitions along with a phylogenetic tree. CDAO provides the framework for representing OTUs, trees, transformations, and characters. The representation of characters and transformations may depend on imported ontologies for a specific type of character. http://www.evolutionaryontology.org/	name,description,homepage	0.6909362077713013

loinc	bartoc	1897	"LOINC LOINC was initiated in 1994 by Clem McDonald, an investigator at the Regenstrief Institute, which is an internationally respected non-profit medical research organization associated with Indiana University. Regenstrief organized the LOINC committee to develop a common terminology for laboratory and clinical observations because there was a growing trend to send clinical data electronically from laboratories and other data producers to hospitals, physician's offices, and payers who use the data for clinical care and management purposes.

At the time, and still today, most laboratories and clinical services use HL7 to send their results electronically from their reporting systems to their care systems. However, the tests in these messages are identified by means of their internal, idiosyncratic code values. As a result, receiving care system cannot fully ""understand"" and properly file the results they receive unless they either adopt the producer's test codes (which is impossible if they receive results from multiple sources), or invest in the work to map each result producer's code system to their internal code system.

Here's the problem that LOINC solves: LOINC provides universal codes and names that provide the global lingua franca for identifying tests and observations. http://loinc.org/"	name,description,homepage	0.6995835304260254

dbest	re3data	r3d100010648	"Expressed Sequence Tags database dbEST is a division of GenBank that contains sequence data and other information on ""single-pass"" cDNA sequences, or ""Expressed Sequence Tags"", from a number of organisms.  Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) are short (usually about 300-500 bp), single-pass sequence reads from mRNA (cDNA). Typically they are produced in large batches. They represent a snapshot of genes expressed in a given tissue and/or at a given developmental stage. They are tags (some coding, others not) of expression for a given cDNA library.
Most EST projects develop large numbers of sequences. These are commonly submitted to GenBank and dbEST as batches of dozens to thousands of entries, with a great deal of redundancy in the citation, submitter and library information. To improve the efficiency of the submission process for this type of data, we have designed a special streamlined submission process and data format.
dbEST also includes sequences that are longer than the traditional ESTs, or are produced as single sequences or in small batches. Among these sequences are products of differential display experiments and RACE experiments. The thing that these sequences have in common with traditional ESTs, regardless of length, quality, or quantity, is that there is little information that can be annotated in the record.
If a sequence is later characterized and annotated with biological features such as a coding region, 5'UTR, or 3'UTR, it should be submitted through the regular GenBank submissions procedure (via BankIt or Sequin), even if part of the sequence is already in dbEST.
dbEST is reserved for single-pass reads. Assembled sequences should not be submitted to dbEST. GenBank will accept assembled EST submissions for the forthcoming TSA (Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly) division.  The individual reads which make up the assembly should be submitted to dbEST, the Trace archive or the Short Read Archive (SRA) prior to the submission of the assemblies. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/dbest/"	name,description,homepage	0.711646556854248

Modeling the anatomy hierarchically makes it possible to record expression results from assays with differing spatial resolution in a consistent and integrated manner. Organizing the anatomical terms as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), i.e., in which a term can have more than one parent, allows presentation of the anatomy from multiple perspectives.

mzspec	fairsharing	FAIRsharing.b549b8	HUPO-PSI Universal Spectrum Identifier The Universal Spectrum Identifier (USI) is multi-part key identifier for identifying mass spectra contained in public data repositories, primarily focused on proteomics. The USI provides a standardized mechanism for encoding a virtual path to any single mass spectrum generated by a mass spectrometer contained/deposited to public proteomics dataset repositories for enabling greater transparency of spectral evidence. With more than 1 billion USI identifications from over 3 billion spectra already available through ProteomeXchange repositories, Universal Spectrum Identifier encodes the dataset, the MS Run, the scan number and the proposed peptidoform and charge of the ions responsible for the spectrum. The USI identifier is comprised of five key components (and an optional sixth component) in defining an abstract path to a specified spectrum. The USI core components include: 1) the prefix ‘mzspec’ to make clear that the following string is a USI and to aid in automated mapping of a USI string to a URL, 2) the subsequent dataset submission or dataset collection identifier assigned by the primary repository archive, 3) the mass spectrometry run name (or root name of the raw vendor format file) such as an mzML file (with or without the file extension), 4)  a type flag (such as ‘scan’, ‘index’ or ‘nativeId’ as defined in the current mzML specification) for indicating how to interpret the fifth component, 5) the index value (based on the flag type) within the specified MS run, and optionally 6) any relevant information for interpretation of the spectrum if available.  http://psidev.info/usi	name,description,homepage	0.7129850387573242

The concepts of the CO are being used to curate agronomic databases and describe the data. The use of ontology terms to describe agronomic phenotypes and the accurate mapping of these descriptions into databases is important in comparative phenotypic and genotypic studies across species and gene-discovery experiments as it provides harmonized description of the data and therefore facilitates the retrieval of information. https://cropontology.org/term/CO_321:ROOT	name,description,homepage	0.717186450958252

The Dicty Phenotype Ontology is a hierarchical controlled vocabulary used for annotating strains with phenotypes. Terms from the Dicty Phenotype Ontology are required when annotating phenotypes within dictyBase. The phenotype ontology consists of two composite terms: (1) the anatomical part or the biological process changed in the mutant, and (2) a quality describing that modification. For example, a ‘delayed aggregation’ phenotype qualifies the ‘aggregation’ (biological process) as being ‘delayed’, or the ‘decreased spore size’ qualifies the ‘spore’ to be of ‘decreased size’. https://github.com/dictyBase/migration-data/blob/master/ontologies/dicty_phenotypes.obo	name,description,homepage	0.7174180746078491

WikiPathways is an open, collaborative platform dedicated to the curation of biological pathways. WikiPathways thus presents a new model for pathway databases that enhances and complements ongoing efforts, such as KEGG, Reactome and Pathway Commons. Building on the same MediaWiki software that powers Wikipedia, we added a custom graphical pathway editing tool and integrated databases covering major gene, protein, and small-molecule systems. The familiar web-based format of WikiPathways greatly reduces the barrier to participate in pathway curation. More importantly, the open, public approach of WikiPathways allows for broader participation by the entire community, ranging from students to senior experts in each field. This approach also shifts the bulk of peer review, editorial curation, and maintenance to the community. https://www.wikipathways.org/	name,description,homepage	0.7187896370887756

homologene	fairsharing	FAIRsharing.mzc066	"NCBI HomoloGene Database HomoloGene is an automated system for the detection of homologs among the annotated genes of several completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes. HomoloGene takes protein sequences from differing species and compares them to one another (using blastp) and matches are placed into groups, using a tree built from sequence similarity to guide the process, where closer related organisms are matched up first, and then further organisms are added as the tree is traversed toward the root. The protein alignments are mapped back to their corresponding DNA sequences, where distance metrics can be calculated (e.g. molecular distance, Ka/Ks ratio). Sequences are matched using synteny when applicable. Remaining sequences are matched up by using an algorithm for maximizing the score globally, rather than locally, in a bipartite matching. Cutoffs on bits per position and Ks values are set to prevent unlikely ""orthologs"" from being grouped together. These cutoffs are calculated based on the respective score distribution for the given groups of organisms. Paralogs are identified by finding sequences that are closer within species than other species. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/homologene"	name,description,homepage	0.7261003255844116

To obtain these protein fingerprints the SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL databases were scanned repetitively. The motifs are usually located on the protein sequence as separate, but consecutive units with no overlaps. They are more effective in encoding protein folds and determining their function than are single motifs. The database contains 2,156 fingerprints and 12,444 single motifs.

worms	bartoc	720	World Register of Marine Species The aim of a World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) is to provide an authoritative and comprehensive list of names of marine organisms, including information on synonymy. While highest priority goes to valid names, other names in use are included so that this register can serve as a guide to interpret taxonomic literature. The content of WoRMS is controlled by taxonomic experts, not by database managers. WoRMS has an editorial management system where each taxonomic group is represented by an expert who has the authority over the content, and is responsible for controlling the quality of the information. Each of these main taxonomic editors can invite several specialists of smaller groups within their area of responsibility to join them. This register of marine species grew out of the European Register of Marine Species (ERMS), and its combination with several other species registers maintained at the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ). Rather than building separate registers for all projects, and to make sure taxonomy used in these different projects is consistent, VLIZ developed a consolidated database called ‘Aphia’. A list of marine species registers included in Aphia is available below. MarineSpecies.org is the web interface for this database. The WoRMS is an idea that is being developed, and will combine information from Aphia with other authoritative marine species lists which are maintained by others (e.g. AlgaeBase, FishBase, Hexacorallia, NeMys). Resources to build MarineSpecies.org and Aphia were provided mainly by the EU Network of Excellence ‘Marine Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning’ (MarBEF), and also by the EU funded Species 2000 Europe and ERMS projects. Intellectual property rights of the European part of the register is managed through the Society for the Management of Electronic Biodiversity Data (SMEBD). Similar solutions are now being investigated for the other parts of the register. Aphia contains valid species names, synonyms and vernacular names, and extra information such as literature and biogeographic data. Besides species names, Aphia also contains the higher classification in which each scientific name is linked to its parent taxon. The classification used is a ‘compromise’ between established systems and recent changes. Its aim is to aid data management, rather than suggest any taxonomic or phylogenetic opinion on species relationships. Keeping WoRMS up-to-date is a continuous process. New information is entered daily by the taxonomic editors and by the members of our data management team. Often data also come in from contributions of large datasets, such as global or regional species lists. No database of this size is without errors and omissions. We can’t promise to make no errors, but we do promise to follow up and give feedback on any communications pointing out errors. Feedback is very welcome! http://www.marinespecies.org/	name,description,homepage	0.7332236766815186

dto	fairsharing	FAIRsharing.tke3y2	Drug Target Ontology Drug Target Ontology (DTO) is developed as a reference for drug targets with the longer-term goal to create a community standard that will facilitate the integration of diverse drug discovery information from numerous heterogeneous resources. The first version of the DTO consists of asserted class hierarchies of the four IDG protein families, GPCRs, kinases, ion channels, and nuclear hormone receptors. Protein classes are linked to tissue and disease via different levels of confidence. DTO also contains drug target development classifications, a large collection of cell lines from the LINCS project and relevant cell-disease and cell-tissue relations. DTO is modeled in OWL2-DL to enable further classification by inference reasoning and SPARQL queries. DTO is implemented following a modularization approach. DTO will serve as the organizational framework for drug targets in the IDG PHAROS User Interface Portal (https://pharos.nih.gov). http://drugtargetontology.org/	name,description,homepage	0.7357374429702759

col	bartoc	1915	"Catalogue of Life The Catalogue of Life (CoL) is the nearest thing to a comprehensive catalogue of all known species of organisms on Earth. Continuous progress is made towards completion, and this edition contains 1,639,016 living and 5,763 extinct species. Please note that this is probably just over three quarters of the world's known species. This means that for many groups it continues to be deficient, and users will notice that many species are still missing from the Catalogue.

The present Catalogue is compiled with sectors provided by 157 taxonomic databases from around the world. Many of these contain taxonomic data and opinions from extensive networks of specialists, so that the complete work contains contributions from more than 3,000 specialists from throughout the taxonomic profession. Species 2000 and ITIS teams peer review databases, select appropriate sectors and integrate the sectors into a single coherent catalogue with a single hierarchical classification. http://www.catalogueoflife.org/col/"	name,description,homepage	0.735977828502655

No consistent nomenclature exists across different vertebrate species. To correctly represent MHC related data in The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), we built upon a previously established MHC ontology (MaHCO) and created MRO to represent MHC molecules as they relate to immunological experiments. MRO models MHC protein chains from 16 species, deals with different approaches used to identify MHC, such as direct sequencing verses serotyping, relates engineered MHC molecules to naturally occurring ones, connects genetic loci, alleles, protein chains and multichain proteins, and establishes evidence codes for MHC restriction. https://github.com/IEDB/MRO	name,description,homepage	0.7417921423912048

ehdaa2	fairsharing	FAIRsharing.7zxrs6	"Edinburgh human developmental anatomy abstract 2 The EHDAA2 ontology is a human developmental anatomy covering the first 49 days [Carnegie stages (CS)1–20], primarily structured around the parts of organ systems and their development. The ontology includes more than 2000 anatomical entities (AEs) that range from the whole embryo, through organ systems and organ parts down to simple or leaf tissues (groups of cells with the same morphological phenotype), as well as features such as cavities. It represents a complete rebuilding of the EHDA intended to meet current standards. Please note that, while available, the OBO Foundry considers this resource to be inactive, therefore please take this into consideration when reviewing this resource. They state: ""The intention has been to include as much information about human developmental anatomy as is practical and as is available in the literature. This ontology has been inactive for several years, as of 2022. As of yet there is no complete replacement ontology, but OBO users may want to consider potential alternatives: 1. HsapDv contains human-specific embryonic stage terms for Carnegie stages; 2. Uberon: includes embryonic anatomy and developmental stage relations, but is more taxonomically general than EHDAA2, and may be less complete and less precise. Uberon includes EHDAA2 in its composite metazoan build. 3. FMA: now includes some human embryonic anatomy, but is constructed on different principles than EHDAA2, and may be less complete and less precise in places.""

odc.sci	fairsharing	FAIRsharing.M6Ruz3	Open Data Commons for Spinal Cord Injury The Open Data Commons for Spinal Cord Injury is a cloud-based community-driven repository to store, share, and publish spinal cord injury research data. There are several challenges for scientific reproducibility and bench-to-bedside translation. For example, only research and data that are published actually get disseminated, a phenomenon known as publication bias. Published research reflects to only a small fraction of all data collected, and data that do not lead to publication are largely ignored, hidden away in filing cabinets and hard drives. This results in an abundance of inaccessible scientific data known as “dark data”. Even when research is disseminated, it is usually in the form of summary reports of aggregated data (e.g. averages across individual subjects) such as scientific articles. The fact that the individual subject-level data are inaccessible further contributes to dark data. The spinal cord injury (SCI) community created the ODC-SCI to mitigate dark data in SCI research. The ODC-SCI also aims to increase transparency with individual-level data, enhance collaboration, facilitate advanced analytics, and conform to increasing mandates by funders and publishers to make data accessible. Members of the ODC-SCI have access to a private digital lab space managed by the PI or multi-PIs for dataset storage and sharing. The PIs can share their labs’ datasets with the registered members of the ODC-SCI community and make their datasets public and citable. The ODC-SCI implements stewardship principles that scientific data be made FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) and has been widely adopted by the international SCI research community. https://odc-sci.org	name,description,homepage	0.7471388578414917

doi	fairsharing	FAIRsharing.hFLKCn	Digital Object Identifier The digital object identifier (DOI) system originated in a joint initiative of three trade associations in the publishing industry (International Publishers Association; International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers; Association of American Publishers). The system was announced at the Frankfurt Book Fair 1997. The International DOI® Foundation (IDF) was created to develop and manage the DOI system, also in 1997. The DOI system was adopted as International Standard ISO 26324 in 2012. The DOI system implements the Handle System and adds a number of new features. The DOI system provides an infrastructure for persistent unique identification of objects of any type. The DOI system is designed to work over the Internet. A DOI name is permanently assigned to an object to provide a resolvable persistent network link to current information about that object, including where the object, or information about it, can be found on the Internet. While information about an object can change over time, its DOI name will not change. A DOI name can be resolved within the DOI system to values of one or more types of data relating to the object identified by that DOI name, such as a URL, an e-mail address, other identifiers and descriptive metadata. The DOI system enables the construction of automated services and transactions. Applications of the DOI system include but are not limited to managing information and documentation location and access; managing metadata; facilitating electronic transactions; persistent unique identification of any form of any data; and commercial and non-commercial transactions. The content of an object associated with a DOI name is described unambiguously by DOI metadata, based on a structured extensible data model that enables the object to be associated with metadata of any desired degree of precision and granularity to support description and services. The data model supports interoperability between DOI applications. The scope of the DOI system is not defined by reference to the type of content (format, etc.) of the referent, but by reference to the functionalities it provides and the context of use. The DOI system provides, within networks of DOI applications, for unique identification, persistence, resolution, metadata and semantic interoperability. https://www.doi.org	name,description,homepage	0.7494019269943237

While the original database was a manually curated database based on published experiments, new promoter collections are now produced entirely automatically (under the name “EPDnew”) based on high-throughput transcript mapping data and high-quality gene annotation resources. Corresponding functional genomics data can be viewed in a genome browser, queried or analyzed via web interfaces, or exported in standard formats like FASTA or BED for subsequent analysis with other tools; of note, EPD is tightly integrated with two tool suites developed by our group: ChIP-Seq and Signal Search Analysis, for analysis of chromatin context and sequence motif respectively. EPD provides promoter viewers, designed with the aim of integrating and displaying information from different sources about, for instance, histone marks, transcription factor-binding sites or SNPs with known phenotypes. These viewers rely upon the UCSC genome browser as a visualization platform, which enables users to view data tracks from EPD jointly with tracks from UCSC or public track hubs. https://epd.epfl.ch/	name,description,homepage	0.7505209445953369

antibodyregistry	integbio	nbdc01696	Antibody Registry The Antibody Registry exists to give researchers a way to universally identify antibodies used in publications. The registry lists many commercial antibodies from about 200 vendors which have each been assigned a unique identifier. If the antibody that you are using does not appear in the list, an entry can be made by filling in as little as 2 pieces of information: the catalog number and the url of the vendor where our curators can find information and material data sheets. Many optional fields can also be filled in that will help curators identify the reagent. After submitting an antibody, you are given a permanent identifier that can be used in publications. This identifier even if it is later found to be a duplicate, can be quickly traced back in the antibody registry. We never delete records, but we collapse duplicate entries on a regular basis (the old identifiers are kept to help with search). https://antibodyregistry.org/	name,description,homepage	0.7538009881973267

The content includes a few name headings (personal and corporate), such as William Shakespeare, Jesus Christ, and Harvard University, and geographic headings that are added to LCSH as they are needed to establish subdivisions, provide a pattern for subdivision practice, or provide reference structure for other terms. This content is expanded beyond the print issue of LCSH (the 'red books') with inclusion of validation strings. *Validation strings: Some authority records are for headings that have been built by adding subdivisions. These records are the result of an ongoing project to programmatically create authority records for valid subject strings from subject heading strings found in bibliographic records. The authority records for these subject strings were created so the entire string could be machine-validated. The strings do not have broader, narrower, or related terms. Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) has been actively maintained since 1898 to catalog materials held at the Library of Congress. By virtue of cooperative cataloging other libraries around the United States also use LCSH to provide subject access to their collections.

genbank	re3data	r3d100010528	GenBank GenBank® is a comprehensive database that contains publicly available nucleotide sequences for almost 260 000 formally described species. These sequences are obtained primarily through submissions from individual laboratories and batch submissions from large-scale sequencing projects, including whole-genome shotgun (WGS) and environmental sampling projects. Most submissions are made using the web-based BankIt or standalone Sequin programs, and GenBank staff assigns accession numbers upon data receipt. Daily data exchange with the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) ensures worldwide coverage. GenBank is accessible through the NCBI Entrez retrieval system, which integrates data from the major DNA and protein sequence databases along with taxonomy, genome, mapping, protein structure and domain information, and the biomedical journal literature via PubMed. BLAST provides sequence similarity searches of GenBank and other sequence databases. Complete bimonthly releases and daily updates of the GenBank database are available by FTP. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/	name,description,homepage	0.7720856070518494

Biolink Model is designed as a way of standardizing types and relational structures in knowledge graphs (KGs), where the KG may be either a property graph or RDF triple store.

The schema is expressed as a YAML, which may be translated into a number of different representations including OWL, Python dataclasses, GraphQL and more. The schema assumes a property graph, where nodes represent individual entities, and edges represent relationship between entities. Biolink Model provides a schema for representing both nodes and edges. The model itself can be divided into a few parts: Entities (subjects and objects), Predicates (relationships between core concepts), Associations (statements including evidence and provenance), Entity Slots (node properties), and Edge Slots (edge properties). https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/"	name,description,homepage	0.7724837064743042

New concepts and properties are located in the namespace of Metadata4Ing.
Metadata4Ing does not import complete ontologies for the sake of relevance, readability, understandability and usability by and for engineers.
Instead, it tries to make re-use of existing identifiers for classes and properties by re-using all or a relevant subset of the axioms from the original ontology.
These statements have been extracted in different ways, e.g. by using Protégé tools importing an ontology and copying axioms of relevant items to Metadata4Ing or by download from data services or raw files of ontologies and manual copypasting.
In some cases there was a need to extend or modify the original set of statements about an entity, e.g. because labels and definitions were expressed with a different owl:AnnotationProperty than the rest of Metadata4Ing, or because a skos:preflabel or a skos:definition in any of the languages we would like to support was missing.
Any editorial changes on elements from external ontologies are declared in Metadata4Ing by an annotation with skos:editorialNote at item-level.
To get the original set of statements we encourage to visit the original namespace of the respective item.

Utilization of a controlled vocabulary creates opportunities to catalogue genes and expression data for computational searches across research groups and cross-species comparisons, all while establishing a framework for integration of new terms. We created a Planarian Anatomy Ontology containing 327 terms and definitions for cellular organelles, cell types, tissues, organ systems, anatomical entities, life cycle stages and developmental processes described in the literature. Where possible, extant terms and definitions from Uberon and other open source anatomy ontologies were imported into the ontology to strengthen cross-species queries. https://planosphere.stowers.org/anatomyontology	name,description,homepage	0.7772475481033325

pw	bioportal	PW	Pathway Ontology The goal of the Pathway Ontology is to cover all types of biological pathways, including altered and disease pathways, and to capture the relationships between them within the hierarchical structure of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The five nodes of the ontology are: classic metabolic, regulatory, signaling, drug and disease pathways. An extensive survey of the review literature along with searches of existing pathway databases have been used to choose terms and their position within the tree. The ontology is continually expanding along with the development of Pathway and Disease Portals at RGD. Mapping of pathways in other databases to terms in PW as synonyms further increased the content of the ontology. It also provided the means to bring in annotations made by these databases and link to their sites via automatic pipelines built at RGD. The ontology allows for the standardized annotation of rat as well as human and mouse genes to pathway terms. It also serves as a vehicle to connect between genes and ontology reports, between reports and interactive pathway diagrams, between pathways that directly connect to one another within a diagram or between pathways that in some fashion are globally related in pathway suites and suite networks. Metabolic, regulatory or signaling pathway terms have associated terms for the altered version of the pathway and the level at which the alteration(s) may occur. Proteins with mutations known to affect a particular pathway can be annotated to the normal and altered version(s) of the pathway and to a disease pathway, if known. Both the provision of terms for the altered versions of pathways and the representation of disease pathway diagrams as a collection of altered pathways are unique to the PW ontology and RGD's pathway data.

As part of this effort, we are developing MultiCellDB: a repository for a curated library of digital cell lines and peer-reviewed simulation and experimental data. A novel part of MultiCellDS is the digital cell line: a digital analogue of experimental cell lines that will help to collect biophysical cell line measurements coming from many research groups and make them readily accessible to an ecosystem of compatible computational models. You can learn more about digital cell lines and other core ideas on this page. We are currently preparing a draft of the upcoming MultiCellDS 1.0 specification.

The developmental mouse anatomy ontology has subsequently been substantially extended and refined in a collaborative effort between EMAP and the Gene Expression Database (GXD) project, part of the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) resource at The Jackson Laboratory. Both GXD and the Edinburgh Mouse Atlas of Gene Expression (EMAGE) database project currently use this anatomy ontology to describe patterns of gene expression in the mouse embryo.

Previous versions, such as the one posted on the OBO Foundry site under the filename EMAP.obo, listed the anatomical entities for each developmental stage (Theiler Stages 1 through 26) separately. Stage-specific instances were presented as uniparental hierarchical trees organized using part-of relationships only (i.e. as a strict partonomy). These hierarchies have been used for annotation of expression in both the EMAGE and GXD databases, and the associated identifiers for the stage-specific instances are preserved. http://www.obofoundry.org/wiki/index.php/EMAPA:Main_Page"	name,description,homepage	0.7929819822311401

ctcae	bioportal	CTCAE	Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) is widely accepted throughout the oncology community as the standard classification and severity grading scale for adverse events in cancer therapy clinical trials and other oncology settings. Version 5 was published by the NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) in November 2017. It is organized by MedDRA System Organ Class and mapped to MedDRA LLTs with corresponding MedDRA codes, and harmonized with MedDRA at the Adverse Event (AE) level including revised AE terms and severity indicators to reflect clinical effects identified with current oncology interventions.Severity grades are assigned and most are defined to clarify the meaning of the term. CTCAE is designed to integrate into information networks for safety data exchange, and is the primary standard for data management for AE data collection, analysis, and patient outcomes associated with cancer research and care. https://nciterms.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/pages/vocabulary.jsf?dictionary=CTCAE_v5&version=5.0	name,description,homepage	0.7931045293807983

eco	bartoc	1028	Evidence Codes Ontology The Evidence Ontology (ECO) describes types of scientific evidence within the realm of biological research that can arise from laboratory experiments, computational methods, manual literature curation, and other means. Researchers can use these types of evidence to support assertions about things (such as scientific conclusions, gene annotations, or other statements of fact) that result from scientific research. ECO comprises two high-level classes, evidence and assertion method, where evidence is defined as “a type of information that is used to support an assertion,” and assertion method is defined as “a means by which a statement is made about an entity.” Together evidence and assertion method can be combined to describe both the support for an assertion and whether that assertion was made by a human being or a computer. However, ECO can not be used to make the assertion itself; for that, one would use another ontology, free text description, or other means. ECO was originally created around the year 2000 to support gene product annotation by the Gene Ontology. http://code.google.com/p/evidenceontology/	name,description,homepage	0.7967873811721802

BAO is an extensible, knowledge-based, highly expressive (currently SHOIQ(D)) description of biological assays making use of descriptive logic based features of the Web Ontology Language (OWL). BAO currently has over 1000 classes and also makes use of several other ontologies. It describes several concepts related to biological screening, including Perturbagen, Format, Meta Target, Design, Detection Technology, and Endpoint. Perturbagens are perturbing agents that are screened in an assay; they are mostly small molecules. Assay Meta Target describes what is known about the biological system and / or its components interrogated in the assay (and influenced by the Perturbagen). Meta target can be directly described as a molecular entity (e.g. a purified protein or a protein complex), or indirectly by a biological process or event (e.g. phosphorylation). Format describes the biological or chemical features common to each test condition in the assay and includes biochemical, cell-based, organism-based, and variations thereof. The assay Design describes the assay methodology and implementation of how the perturbation of the biological system is translated into a detectable signal. Detection Technology relates to the physical method and technical details to detect and record a signal. Endpoints are the final HTS results as they are usually published (such as IC50, percent inhibition, etc.). BAO has been designed to accommodate multiplexed assays. All main BAO components include multiple levels of sub-categories and specification classes, which are linked via object property relationships forming an expressive knowledge-based representation. http://www.bioassayontology.org/	name,description,homepage	0.7981086373329163

bao	ols	bao	BioAssay Ontology The BioAssay Ontology (BAO) describes biological screening assays and their results including high-throughput screening (HTS) data for the purpose of categorizing assays and data analysis. BAO is an extensible, knowledge-based, highly expressive (currently SHOIQ(D)) description of biological assays making use of descriptive logic based features of the Web Ontology Language (OWL). BAO currently has over 700 classes and also makes use of several other ontologies. It describes several concepts related to biological screening, including Perturbagen, Format, Meta Target, Design, Detection Technology, and Endpoint. Perturbagens are perturbing agents that are screened in an assay; they are mostly small molecules. Assay Meta Target describes what is known about the biological system and / or its components interrogated in the assay (and influenced by the Perturbagen). Meta target can be directly described as a molecular entity (e.g. a purified protein or a protein complex), or indirectly by a biological process or event (e.g. phosphorylation). Format describes the biological or chemical features common to each test condition in the assay and includes biochemical, cell-based, organism-based, and variations thereof. The assay Design describes the assay methodology and implementation of how the perturbation of the biological system is translated into a detectable signal. Detection Technology relates to the physical method and technical details to detect and record a signal. Endpoints are the final HTS results as they are usually published (such as IC50, percent inhibition, etc). BAO has been designed to accommodate multiplexed assays. All main BAO components include multiple levels of sub-categories and specification classes, which are linked via object property relationships forming an expressive knowledge-based representation. http://bioassayontology.org	name,description,homepage	0.7990888357162476

hcpcs	fairsharing	FAIRsharing.x81wz8	Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System Each year, in the United States, health care insurers process over 5 billion claims for payment. For Medicare and other health insurance programs to ensure that these claims are processed in an orderly and consistent manner, standardized coding systems are essential. The HCPCS is divided into two principal subsystems, referred to as level I and level II of the HCPCS. Level I of the HCPCS is comprised of CPT (Current Procedural Terminology), a numeric coding system maintained by the American Medical Association (AMA). Level II of the HCPCS is a standardized coding system that is used primarily to identify products, supplies, and services not included in the CPT codes, such as ambulance services and durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) when used outside a physician's office. https://www.cms.gov/medicare/coding/medhcpcsgeninfo/index.html	name,description,homepage	0.7992587089538574

They are used to express descriptions of resources. RDF datasets are used to organize collections of RDF graphs, and comprise a default graph and zero or more named graphs. RDF 1.1 Concepts and Abstract Syntax also introduces key concepts and terminology, and discusses datatyping and the handling of fragment identifiers in IRIs within RDF graphs. http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-rdf11-concepts-20140225/	name,description,homepage	0.8020728826522827

ppo	agroportal	PPO	Plant Phenology Ontology Plant phenology — the timing of plant life-cycle events, such as flowering or leafing-out — has cascading effects on multiple levels of biological organization, from individuals to ecosystems, and is crucial for understanding the links between climate and biological communities. Plant phenology data are collected and used by many different types of researchers, from plant breeders to ecosystem ecologists. Today, thanks to data digitization and aggregation initiatives, phenology monitoring networks, and the efforts of citizen scientists, more phenologically relevant data is available than ever before. Unfortunately, combining these data in large-scale analyses remains prohibitively difficult, mostly because the individuals and organizations producing the data are using non-standardized terminologies and metrics during data collection and processing. Lack of standardization remains particularly problematic for historical datasets, which are crucial for time-based analyses. The Plant Phenology Ontology (PPO) is a collaborative effort to help solve these problems by developing the standardized terminology, definitions, and relations that are needed for large-scale data integration. The PPO builds on the widely used Plant Ontology (PO) and Phenotype and Trait Ontology (PATO) to promote broad reuse of phenological data. The initial use case for the PPO is integration of citizen science data from the USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN) and the Pan-European Phenology Network (PEP), but work is also planned for integrating data from herbaria., An ontology that defines plant phenological classes and is used to run the plantphenology.org data portal.

lrg	hl7	2.16.840.1.113883.6.283	Locus Reference Genomic Sequences (LRG) In collaboration with NCBI, the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) is developing the Locus Reference Genomic Sequences (LRG) database, which is a database of reference sequences. LRG is a system for providing a genomic DNA sequence representation of a single gene that is idealized, has a permanent ID (with no versioning), and core content that never changes. LRG is not a nomenclature system. More than one LRG could be created for a region of interest, should that need arise.  Additional annotations will be present that may change with time (each item carrying its own date stamp), so that the latest ancillary knowledge about a gene is directly available.  In other words, an LRG sequence and its core annotation are not meant to represent current biology knowledge, but to provide a standard for reporting variation in a stable coordinate system.  The combination of the LRG plus the updatable-annotation layer will be used to support the biological interpretation of variants.LRG identifiers can be used with the HL7 coded data type (code data type that accepts expression data, or a coded expression data type).  This coded data type will be  gene symbols can be used with the HL7 coded data type.  For example, in the HL7 messages specified according to the HL7 V2 Clinical Genomics Fully LOINC-Qualified Genetic Variation Model, LRG identifiers can be used to as the observation values for Genomic Reference Sequence Identifier (LOINC code: 48013-7).

mesh	bartoc	391	Medical Subject Headings MeSH is the National Library of Medicine's controlled vocabulary thesaurus. It consists of sets of terms naming descriptors in a hierarchical structure that permits searching at various levels of specificity. MeSH descriptors are arranged in both an alphabetic and a hierarchical structure. At the most general level of the hierarchical structure are very broad headings such as 'Anatomy' or 'Mental Disorders'. More specific headings are found at more narrow levels of the twelve-level hierarchy, such as 'Ankle' and 'Conduct Disorder'. There are 26,142 descriptors in 2011 MeSH. There are also over 177,000 entry terms that assist in finding the most appropriate MeSH Heading, for example, 'Vitamin C' is an entry term to 'Ascorbic Acid'. In addition to these headings, there are more than 199,000 headings called Supplementary Concept Records (formerly Supplementary Chemical Records) within a separate thesaurus. The MeSH thesaurus is used by NLM for indexing articles from 5,400 of the world's leading biomedical journals for the MEDLINE®/PubMED® database. It is also used for the NLM-produced database that includes cataloging of books, documents, and audiovisuals acquired by the Library. Each bibliographic reference is associated with a set of MeSH terms that describe the content of the item. Similarly, search queries use MeSH vocabulary to find items on a desired topic. http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/	name,description,homepage	0.8096017837524414

aeo	bartoc	181	"Ontology of Anatomical Entities The AEO is an ontology of anatomical structures that expands CARO, the Common Anatomy Reference Ontology, to about 160 classes using the is_a relationship; it thus provides a detailed type classification for tissues. The ~100 new classes were chosen for their use in categorizing the major vertebrate and invertebrate anatomy ontologies at a granularity adequate for tissues of a single cell type.

The AEO is intended to be useful in increasing the amount of knowledge in anatomy ontologies, facilitating annotation and enabling interoperability across anatomy ontologies.

An important subcategory of the AEO is simple tissue (a synonym of the CARO portion of tissue), a recognisable anatomical entity composed predominantly to a single cell type. CARO had a only few epithelial classes here and these are inadequate for capturing the richness of anatomical tissue knowledge. The AEO has ~70 simple tissues and these are linked to their cell types (~100) as detailed in the cell type ontology through a has_part relationship. The AEO thus includes a subset of the cell type ontology.

The AEO has been refined through its use in annotating the ~2500 terms of the new version of the Ontology of Developing Human Anatomy and, while this has improved the ontology, it may have given it a mammalian bias.

The ontology can be used to classify most organisms as its terms are appropriate for most plant and fungal tissues. I plan to improve the ontology to include more non-animal anatomical terms."	name,description	0.8109819889068604

Its creators envision the VIAF as a building block for the Semantic Web to enable switching of the displayed form of names for persons to the preferred language and script of the Web user. VIAF began as a joint project with the Library of Congress (LC), the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek (DNB), the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BNF) and OCLC. It has, over the past decade, become a cooperative effort involving an expanding number of other national libraries and other agencies. (...)

VIAF helps to make library authority files less expensive to maintain and more generally useful to the library domain and beyond. To achieve this, VIAF matches and links the authority files of national libraries and groups all authority records for a given entity into a merged 'super' authority record that brings together the different names for that entity. By linking disparate names for the same person or organization, VIAF provides a convenient means for a wider community of libraries and other agencies to repurpose bibliographic data produced by libraries serving different language communities. http://viaf.org/"	name,description,homepage	0.8114211559295654

sbo	bioportal	SBO	"Systems Biology Ontology The Systems Biology Ontology is a set of controlled, relational vocabularies of terms commonly used in Systems Biology, and in particular in computational modeling. The ontology consists of six orthogonal vocabularies defining: the roles of reaction participants (eg. ""substrate""), quantitative parameters (eg. ""Michaelis constant""), a precise classification of mathematical expressions that describe the system (eg. ""mass action rate law""), the modeling framework used (eg. ""logical framework""), and a branch each to describe entity (eg. ""macromolecule"") and interaction (eg. ""process"") types, and a branch to define the different types of metadata that may be present within a model. SBO terms can be used to introduce a layer of semantic information into the standard description of a model, or to annotate the results of biochemical experiments in order to facilitate their efficient reuse. SBO is an Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) candidate ontology, and is free for use.

edda	fairsharing	FAIRsharing.2ffmsb	EDDA Study Designs Taxonomy Terminology of study designs and publication types (beta version). Developed by the Evidence in Documents, Discovery, and Analysis (EDDA) Group. Tanja Bekhuis (PI); Eugene Tseytlin (Systems Developer); Ashleigh Faith (Taxonomist). Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pennsylvania, US. This work was made possible, in part, by the US National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, grant no. R00LM010943. Based on research described in Bekhuis T, Demner-Fushman D, Crowley RS. Comparative effectiveness research designs: an analysis of terms and coverage in Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Emtree. Journal of the Medical Library Association (JMLA). 2013 April;101(2):92-100. PMC3634392. The terminology appearing in JMLA has been enriched with terms from MeSH, NCI Thesaurus (NCIT), and Emtree, the controlled vocabularies for MEDLINE, the National Cancer Institute, and Embase, respectively, as well as from published research literature. Variants include synonyms for preferred terms, singular and plural forms, and American and British spellings. Definitions, if they exist, are mainly from MeSH, NCIT, Emtree, and medical dictionaries. A class for Publication Type is included because investigators consider type and design when screening reports for inclusion in comparative effectiveness research.

dto	bioportal	DTO	Drug Target Ontology Drug Target Ontology (DTO) is being developed at the University of Miami in the research group of Stephan Schürer. DTO is supported by grant U54CA189205 (Illuminating the Druggable Genome Knowledge Management Center, Tudor Oprea, PI) awarded by the NCI through the NIH Common Fund. It is a component of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project (https://commonfund.nih.gov/idg). The DTO project develops a novel semantic framework to formalize knowledge about drug targets with a focus on the current IDG protein families. The DTO is developed as a reference for drug targets with the longer-term goal to create a community standard that will facilitate the integration of diverse drug discovery information from numerous heterogeneous resources. The first version of the DTO consists of asserted class hierarchies of the four IDG protein families, GPCRs, kinases, ion channels, and nuclear hormone receptors. Protein classes are linked to tissue and disease via different levels of confidence. DTO also contains drug target development level classifications developed in the IDG project (http://targetcentral.ws/), and functional and qualitative annotations and classifications for kinase proteins, GPCR ligands and ion channels. DTO is modeled in OWL2-DL to enable further classification by inference reasoning and SPARQL queries. DTO is implemented following a modularization approach. DTO is used as the organizational framework for drug targets in the IDG PHAROS User Interface Portal (https://pharos.nih.gov) and also the Tin-X Target Importance and Novelty Explorer (http://newdrugtargets.org). http://drugtargetontology.org/	name,description,homepage	0.8193468451499939

Many knowledge organization systems, such as thesauri, taxonomies, classification schemes and subject heading systems, share a similar structure, and are used in similar applications. SKOS captures much of this similarity and makes it explicit, to enable data and technology sharing across diverse applications. The SKOS data model provides a standard, low-cost migration path for porting existing knowledge organization systems to the Semantic Web. SKOS also provides a lightweight, intuitive language for developing and sharing new knowledge organization systems. It may be used on its own, or in combination with formal knowledge representation languages such as the Web Ontology language (OWL). The main objective of SKOS is to enable easy sharing and linking of controlled structured vocabularies for semantic web. http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference	name,description,homepage	0.8301268219947815

encode	fairsharing	FAIRsharing.v0hbjs	Encyclopedia of DNA Elements The ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) Consortium is an international collaboration of research groups funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). The goal of ENCODE is to build a comprehensive parts list of functional elements in the human genome including elements that act at the protein and RNA levels, and regulatory elements that control cells and circumstances in which a gene is active. ENCODE investigators employ a variety of assays and methods to identify functional elements. The discovery and annotation of gene elements is accomplished primarily by sequencing a diverse range of RNA sources, comparative genomics, integrative bioinformatic methods, and human curation. Regulatory elements are typically investigated through DNA hypersensitivity assays, assays of DNA methylation, and immunoprecipitation (IP) of proteins that interact with DNA and RNA, i.e., modified histones, transcription factors, chromatin regulators, and RNA-binding proteins, followed by sequencing. https://www.encodeproject.org/	name,description,homepage	0.8304884433746338
dip	re3data	r3d100010670	Database of Interacting Proteins The DIP database catalogs experimentally determined interactions between proteins. It combines information from a variety of sources to create a single, consistent set of protein-protein interactions. The data stored within the DIP database were curated, both, manually by expert curators and also automatically using computational approaches that utilize the the knowledge about the protein-protein interaction networks extracted from the most reliable, core subset of the DIP data. Please, check the reference page to find articles describing the DIP database in greater detail. The Database of Ligand-Receptor Partners (DLRP) is a subset of DIP (Database of Interacting Proteins). The DLRP is a database of protein ligand and protein receptor pairs that are known to interact with each other. By interact we mean that the ligand and receptor are members of a ligand-receptor complex and, unless otherwise noted, transduce a signal. In some instances the ligand and/or receptor may form a heterocomplex with other ligands/receptors in order to be functional. We have entered the majority of interactions in DLRP as full DIP entries, with links to references and additional information https://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/dip/Main.cgi	name,description,homepage	0.8304893970489502

mdm	fairsharing	FAIRsharing.wnk2eq	Medical Data Models MDM-Portal (Medical Data-Models) is a meta-data registry for creating, analysing, sharing and reusing medical forms, developed by the Institute of Medical Informatics, University of Muenster in Germany. see also http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26868052 Electronic forms for documentation of patient data are an integral part within the workflow of physicians. A huge amount of data is collected either through routine documentation forms (EHRs) for electronic health records or as case report forms (CRFs) for clinical trials. This raises major scientific challenges for health care, since different health information systems are not necessarily compatible with each other and thus information exchange of structured data is hampered. Software vendors provide a variety of individual documentation forms according to their standard contracts, which function as isolated applications. Furthermore, free availability of those forms is rarely the case. Currently less than 5 % of medical forms are freely accessible. Based on this lack of transparency harmonization of data models in health care is extremely cumbersome, thus work and know-how of completed clinical trials and routine documentation in hospitals are hard to be re-used. The MDM-Portal serves as an infrastructure for academic (non-commercial) medical research to contribute a solution to this problem. It already contains more than 6,000 system-independent forms (CDISC ODM Format, www.cdisc.org, Operational Data Model) with more than 470,000 data-elements. This enables researchers to view, discuss, download and export forms in most common technical formats such as PDF, CSV, Excel, SQL, SPSS, R, etc. A growing user community will lead to a growing database of medical forms. In this matter, we would like to encourage all medical researchers to register and add forms and discuss existing forms. https://medical-data-models.org	name,description,homepage	0.8442305326461792

xml	fairsharing	FAIRsharing.b5cc91	Extensible Markup Language The Extensible Markup Language (XML) describes a class of data objects called XML documents and partially describes the behavior of computer programs which process them. XML is an application profile or restricted form of SGML, the Standard Generalized Markup Language [ISO 8879]. By construction, XML documents are conforming SGML documents. XML documents are made up of storage units called entities, which contain either parsed or unparsed data. Parsed data is made up of characters, some of which form character data, and some of which form markup. Markup encodes a description of the document's storage layout and logical structure. XML provides a mechanism to impose constraints on the storage layout and logical structure. https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/	name,description,homepage	0.8463505506515503

Ensembl is a joint project between the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI) to develop a software system that produces and maintains automatic annotation on selected genomes.The Ensembl project was started in 1999, some years before the draft human genome was completed. Even at that early stage it was clear that manual annotation of 3 billion base pairs of sequence would not be able to offer researchers timely access to the latest data. The goal of Ensembl was therefore to automatically annotate the genome, integrate this annotation with other available biological data and make all this publicly available via the web. Since the website's launch in July 2000, many more genomes have been added to Ensembl and the range of available data has also expanded to include comparative genomics, variation and regulatory data. Ensembl is a joint project between European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), an outstation of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI).

inchi	fairsharing	FAIRsharing.ddk9t9	IUPAC International Chemical Identifier Originally developed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChI) is a machine-readable string generated from a chemical structure. InChIs are unique to the compound they describe and can encode absolute stereochemistry making chemicals and chemistry machine-readable and discoverable. A simple analogy is that InChI is the bar-code for chemistry and chemical structures. A hashed fixed-length version of the InChI, the InChIKey, is also widely used.  The InChI format and algorithm are non-proprietary and the software is open source, with ongoing development done by the community. A number of IUPAC working groups are working on extensions and new applications of the standard. https://www.inchi-trust.org/	name,description,homepage	0.8506561517715454

emapa	fairsharing	FAIRsharing.j0fa1d	"Mouse Developmental Anatomy Ontology The ontology of mouse developmental anatomy was originally developed by Jonathan Bard and his colleagues as part of the Edinburgh Mouse Atlas Project (EMAP) in order to provide a structured controlled vocabulary of stage-specific anatomical structures for the developing laboratory mouse.

Initial versions listed anatomical entities for each developmental stage (Theiler Stages 1 through 26) separately. Stage-specific instances were presented as uniparental hierarchies organized solely using part-of relationships (i.e. as a strict partonomy). An ‘abstract’ (i.e. non-stage-specific) representation of the mouse developmental anatomy ontology was subsequently developed.

The mouse developmental anatomy ontology has been substantially extended and refined over many years in a collaborative effort between EMAP and the Gene Expression Database (GXD) project, part of the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) resource at The Jackson Laboratory. The ontology continues to be maintained and expanded by GXD. https://www.informatics.jax.org/vocab/gxd/anatomy"	name,description,homepage	0.8515561819076538

oci	n2t	oci	OpenCitations Each OCI (Open Citation Identifier) has a simple structure: oci:number-number, where &#x201C;oci:&#x201D; is the identifier prefix, and is used to identify a citation as a first-class data entitiy - see https://opencitations.wordpress.com/2018/02/19/citations-as-first-class-data-entities-introduction/ for additional information.  OCIs for citations stored within the OpenCitations Corpus are constructed by combining the OpenCitations Corpus local identifiers for the citing and cited bibliographic resources, separating them with a dash. For example, oci:2544384-7295288 is a valid OCI for the citation between two papers stored within the OpenCitations Corpus.  OCIs can also be created for bibliographic resources described in an external bibliographic database, if they are similarly identified there by identifiers having a unique numerical part. For example, the OCI for the citation that exists between Wikidata resources Q27931310 and Q22252312 is oci:01027931310&#x2013;01022252312.

The database is designed to contain or link three kinds of data: 1) chemical data, 2) clinical data, and 3) molecular biology/biochemistry data. The database contains 220,945 metabolite entries including both water-soluble and lipid soluble metabolites. Additionally, 8,610 protein sequences (enzymes and transporters) are linked to these metabolite entries. Each MetaboCard entry contains 130 data fields with 2/3 of the information being devoted to chemical/clinical data and the other 1/3 devoted to enzymatic or biochemical data. Many data fields are hyperlinked to other databases (KEGG, PubChem, MetaCyc, ChEBI, PDB, UniProt, and GenBank) and a variety of structure and pathway viewing applets. The HMDB database supports extensive text, sequence, chemical structure, MS and NMR spectral query searches. Four additional databases, DrugBank, T3DB, SMPDB and FooDB are also part of the HMDB suite of databases.

The resulting information resources, however, lack extensive and reliable exposure data, which are required to translate molecular insights, elucidate environmental contributions to diseases, and assess human health risks at the individual and population levels. We report our development of an Exposure Ontology, ExO, designed to address this information gap by facilitating centralization and integration of exposure data to inform understanding of environmental health. Like other widely used ontologies, ExO is intended to bridge the gap between exposure science and diverse environmental health disciplines including toxicology, epidemiology, disease surveillance, and epigenetics. https://github.com/CTDbase/exposure-ontology	name,description,homepage	0.8613991737365723
slso	bioportal	SLSO	Space Life Sciences Ontology The Space Life Sciences Ontology is an application ontology and is intended to support the operation of NASA's Life Sciences Data Archive (located at https://nlsp.nasa.gov) and other systems that contain space life science research data. Many kinds of scientific research in space involve specialized equipment, experimental procedures, specimens and specimen collection apparatus, supporting operational structures, and references to specific space environments and their characteristics. Often such research is extremely costly compared with planetary/terrestrial investigations, and the community supporting space life sciences is accustomed to the use of various specialized concepts and terminologies when dealing with this kind of research and data. However, the underlying conceptual models (and especially the specific labeled relationships in these models) have never been made explicit. The SLSO attempts to provide definition and organization of these models for the space research community. The SLSO was developed ab inicio using the Ontology Development Kit and imports an extends many concepts from the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), the Ontology of Biomedical Investigations (OBI), the Environmental Ontology (ENVO), and other OBO Foundry ontologies. Projects at NASA such as the Open Science Data Repository (https://osdr.nasa.gov/) are already using many OBO ontologies, including the Radiation Biology Ontology (https://github.com/Radiobiology-Informatics-Consortium/RBO) and OBI, to index space biology investigation data. With the development of the SLSO, this practice can be extended to include all life science research in space or addressing space effects. Furthermore, the SLSO has a component that imports concepts from the Science Data Discovery Ontology, which was developed to support NASA's Science Discovery Engine (https://sciencediscoveryengine.nasa.gov). These links in the imported SDDO to concepts underlying a broad spectrum of space research (astrophysics, heliophysics, etc.) can ultimately be used to provide key capabilities for discovering and analyzing space life science data and how they relate to other kinds of scientific data regarding space environments. https://github.com/nasa/LSDAO/tree/master/src/ontology	name,description,homepage	0.8614123463630676

icd10	bartoc	447	International Statistical Classification of Diseases The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is the standard diagnostic tool for epidemiology, health management and clinical purposes. This includes the analysis of the general health situation of population groups. It is used to monitor the incidence and prevalence of diseases and other health problems. It is used to classify diseases and other health problems recorded on many types of health and vital records including death certificates and health records. In addition to enabling the storage and retrieval of diagnostic information for clinical, epidemiological and quality purposes, these records also provide the basis for the compilation of national mortality and morbidity statistics by WHO Member States. It is used for reimbursement and resource allocation decision-making by countries. ICD-10 was endorsed by the Forty-third World Health Assembly in May 1990 and came into use in WHO Member States as from 1994. The 11th revision of the classification has already started and will continue until 2015. https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/classification-of-diseases	name,description,homepage	0.8631733655929565

oae	fairsharing	FAIRsharing.tw4q8x	Ontology of Adverse Events The Ontology of Adverse Events (OAE) is a community-driven ontology that is developed to standardize and integrate data on biomedical adverse events (e.g., vaccine and drug adverse events) and support computer-assisted reasoning. As a result of a medical intervention, events may occur which lie outside the intended consequences of the intervention. Some of these events are adverse events, in the sense that they are pathological bodily processes. For many such adverse events it is unclear whether they are causal consequences of the medical intervention which preceded them, since adverse events may also occur due to other reasons (for example a natural viral infection). OAE was created to represent the whole process from initial medical intervention to subsequent outcomes. https://github.com/oae-ontology	name,description,homepage	0.8792797923088074

QUDT provides a unified model of measurable quantities, units for measuring different kinds of quantities, the numerical values of quantities in different units of measure and the data structures and data types used to store and manipulate these objects in software. This OWL schema is a foundation for a basic treatment of units. Originally developed by TopQuadrant for the NASA Exploration Initiatives Ontology Models (NExIOM) project, they now form the basis of the NASA QUDT Handbook.

cellosaurus	re3data	r3d100013293	Cellosaurus The Cellosaurus is a knowledge resource on cell lines. It attempts to describe all cell lines used in biomedical research. Its scope includes: Immortalized cell lines, Naturally immortal cell lines (example: stem cell lines), Finite life cell lines when those are distributed and used widely, Vertebrate cell line with an emphasis on human, mouse and rat cell lines, Invertebrate (insects and ticks) cell lines. Its scope does not include: Primary cell lines (with the exception of the finite life cell lines described above), Plant cell lines.  Cellosaurus was initiated to be used as a cell line controlled vocabulary in the context of the neXtProt knowledgebase, but it quickly become apparent that there was a need for a cell line knowledge resource that would serve the needs of individual researchers, cell line distributors and bioinformatic resources. This leads to an increase of the scope and depth of the content of the Cellosaurus. The Cellosaurus is a participant of the Resource Identification Initiative and contributes actively to the work of the International Cell Line Authentication Committee (ICLAC).

AGROVOC consists of over 40,900 concepts available in up to 42 languages: Arabic, Belarusian, Chinese, Czech, English, Estonian, French, German, Hindi, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Lao, Malay, Norwegian Bokmål, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swahili, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian and others.

You can use AGROVOC to look up the common name of a plant in a language that you do not master, or to find  relations between a commodity and the crop from which it is produced. Your library can use AGROVOC to index its documents, or you can use it from inside your content management system (e.g., Drupal) to organize your documents or web site. You can also use AGROVOC as an hub to access many other vocabularies available on the web.

To date, AGROVOC is used by researchers, librarians and information managers for indexing, retrieving and organizing data in agricultural information systems and Web pages. Currently, AGROVOC is an SKOS-XL concept scheme and a Linked Open Data (LOD) set aligned with 16 other multilingual knowledge organization systems related to agriculture.

One is a ”Food Ontology” consisting of raw foods and multi-component foods while the second is a ”Biomarker Ontology” containing food intake biomarkers classified by their chemical classes. These two sub-ontologies are conceptually independent but interconnected by different properties. This allows data and information regarding foods and food biomarkers to be visualized in a bidirectional way, going from metabolomics to nutritional data or vice versa. Potential applications of this ontology include the annotation of foods and biomarkers using a well-defined and consistent nomenclature, the standardized reporting of metabolomics workflows (e.g. metabolite identification, experimental design), or the application of different enrichment analysis approaches to analyze nutrimetabolomic data. https://github.com/pcastellanoescuder/FoodBiomarkerOntology	name,description,homepage	0.9079188704490662

A fingerprint is a group of conserved motifs used to characterise a protein family; its diagnostic power is refined by iterative scanning of a SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL composite. Usually the motifs do not overlap, but are separated along a sequence, though they may be contiguous in 3D-space. Fingerprints can encode protein folds and functionalities more flexibly and powerfully than can single motifs, full diagnostic potency deriving from the mutual context provided by motif neighbours. http://www.bioinf.manchester.ac.uk/dbbrowser/sprint/ http://www.bioinf.manchester.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbbrowser/sprint/searchprintss.cgi?prints_accn=$1&display_opts=Prints&category=None&queryform=false&regexpr=off	name,description,homepage,uri_format	0.9250825643539429

The mission of the ISNI International Agency (ISNI-IA) is to assign to the public name(s) of a researcher, inventor, writer, artist, performer, publisher, etc. a persistent unique identifying number in order to resolve the problem of name ambiguity in search and discovery; and diffuse each assigned ISNI across all repertoires in the global supply chain so that every published work can be unambiguously attributed to its creator wherever that work is described.

rfam	miriam	rfam	RFAM The Rfam database is a collection of RNA families, each represented by multiple sequence alignments, consensus secondary structures and covariance models (CMs). The families in Rfam break down into three broad functional classes: non-coding RNA genes, structured cis-regulatory elements and self-splicing RNAs. Typically these functional RNAs often have a conserved secondary structure which may be better preserved than the RNA sequence. The CMs used to describe each family are a slightly more complicated relative of the profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) used by Pfam. CMs can simultaneously model RNA sequence and the structure in an elegant and accurate fashion. https://rfam.org/ https://rfam.org/family/$1	name,description,homepage,uri_format	0.954215407371521

mcc	bioportal	MCCL	Cell Line Ontology [by Mahadevan] Ontologies provide a common platform of controlled vocabulary for researchers who need to share information across a particular domain, inclusive of machine-interpretable definitions of basic concepts in the domain and relations among them. The need for ontologies that provide a systematic arrangement of available data and allow cross talk across various related domains is gaining momentum. In this backdrop, we have developed a comprehensive ontology on primary and established cell lines-both normal and pathologic. It covers around 400 cell lines. This ontology has been built to include the major domains in the field of biology like anatomy, bio-molecules, chemicals and drugs, pathological conditions and genetic variations around the cell lines. An extensive network of relations has been built across these concepts to enable different combinations of queries. The ontology covers all cell lines from major sources like ATCC, DSMZ, ECACC, ICLC etc. and is built in OWL format. http://www.molecularconnections.com	name,description,homepage	0.9616444110870361

goldbook	bartoc	1884	"IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology The Compendium is popularly referred to as the 'Gold Book', in recognition of the contribution of the late Victor Gold, who initiated work on the first edition. It is one of the series of IUPAC 'Colour Books' on chemical nomenclature, terminology, symbols and units (see the list of source documents), and collects together terminology definitions from IUPAC recommendations already published in Pure and Applied Chemistry and in the other Colour Books.

Terminology definitions published by IUPAC are drafted by international committees of experts in the appropriate chemistry sub-disciplines, and ratified by IUPAC's Interdivisional Committee on Terminology, Nomenclature and Symbols (ICTNS). In this edition of the Compendium these IUPAC-approved definitions are supplemented with some definitions from ISO and from the International Vocabulary of Basic and General Terms in Metrology; both these sources are recognised by IUPAC as authoritative. The result is a collection of nearly 7000 terms, with authoritative definitions, spanning the whole range of chemistry.

Some minor editorial changes were made to the originally published definitions, to harmonise the presentation and to clarify their applicability, if this is limited to a particular sub-discipline. Verbal definitions of terms from Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry (the IUPAC Green Book, in which definitions are generally given as mathematical expressions) were developed specially for this Compendium by the Physical Chemistry Division of IUPAC. Definitions of a few physicochemical terms not mentioned in the Green Book were added at the same time (referred to here as Physical Chemistry Division, unpublished).

The first reference given at the end of each definition is to the page of Pure Appl. Chem. or other source where the original definition appears; other references given designate other places where compatible definitions of the same term or additional information may be found, in other IUPAC documents. The complete reference citations are given in the appended list of source documents. Highlighted terms within individual definitions link to other entries where additional information is available. http://goldbook.iupac.org/"	name,description,homepage	0.9663516283035278

In the abstract mouse, it has a single ID so that the abstract term given as just <i>heart</i> really means <i>heart (CS 9-20)</i>. Timing details will be added to the abstract version of the ontology in a future release. http://obofoundry.org/ontology/ehdaa.html	name,description,homepage	0.9773348569869995

obib	ols	obib	Ontology for BIoBanking (OBIB) The Ontology for Biobanking (OBIB) is an ontology for the annotation and modeling of the activities, contents, and administration of a biobank. Biobanks are facilities that store specimens, such as bodily fluids and tissues, typically along with specimen annotation and clinical data. OBIB is based on a subset of the Ontology for Biomedical Investigation (OBI), has the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as its upper ontology, and is developed following OBO Foundry principles. The first version of OBIB resulted from the merging of two existing biobank-related ontologies, OMIABIS and biobank ontology. https://github.com/biobanking/biobanking	name,description,homepage	0.9860496520996094

cdno	ols	cdno	Compositional Dietary Nutrition Ontology The CDNO provides structured terminologies to describe nutritional attributes of material entities that contribute to human diet. These terms are intended primarily to be associated with datasets that quantify concentration of chemical nutritional components derived from samples taken from any stage in the production of food raw materials (including from crops, livestock, fisheries) and through processing and supply chains. Additional knowledge associated with these dietary sources may be represented by terms that describe functional, physical and other attributes. Whilst recognising that dietary nutrients within food substrates may be present as complex and dynamic physical and chemical structures or mixtures, CDNO focuses on components typically quantified in an analytical chemistry laboratory. The primary CDNO class ‘dietary nutritional component’ contains hierarchical sets of terms organised to reflect commonly used classifications of chemical food composition. This class does not represent an exhaustive classification of chemical components, but focuses on structuring terms according to widely accepted categories. This class is independent of, but may be used in conjunction with, classes that describe ‘analytical methods’ for quantification, ‘physical properties’ or ‘dietary function’. Quantification data may be used and reported in research literature, to inform food composition tables and labelling, or for supply chain quality assurance and control. More specifically, terms within the ‘nutritional component concentration’ class may be used to represent quantification of components described in the ‘dietary nutritional component’ class. Concentration data are intended to be described in conjunction with post-composed metadata concepts, such as represented by the Food Ontology (FoodOn) ‘Food product by organism’, which derives from some food or anatomical entity and a NCBI organismal classification ontology (NCBITaxon) entity. The common vocabulary and relationships defined within CDNO should facilitate description, communication and exchange of material entity-derived nutritional composition datasets typically generated by analytical laboratories. The organisation of the vocabulary is structured to reflect common categories variously used by those involved in crop, livestock or other organismal production, associated R&D and breeding, as well as the food processing and supply sector, and nutritionists, inlcuding compilers and users of food composition databases. The CDNO therefore supports characterisation of genetic diversity and management of biodiversity collections, as well as sharing of knowledge relating to dietary composition between a wider set of researchers, breeders, farmers, processors and other stakeholders. Further development of the functional class should also assist in understanding how interactions between organismal genetic and environmental variation contribute to human diet and health in the farm to fork continuum. https://cdno.info/	name,description,homepage	0.9917173981666565

The primary CDNO class ‘dietary nutritional component’ contains hierarchical sets of terms organised to reflect commonly used classifications of chemical food composition. This class does not represent an exhaustive classification of chemical components, but focuses on structuring terms according to widely accepted categories. This class is independent of, but may be used in conjunction with, classes that describe ‘analytical methods’ for quantification, ‘physical properties’ or ‘dietary function’. Quantification data may be used and reported in research literature, to inform food composition tables and labelling, or for supply chain quality assurance and control. More specifically, terms within the ‘nutritional component concentration’ class may be used to represent quantification of components described in the ‘dietary nutritional component’ class. Concentration data are intended to be described in conjunction with post-composed metadata concepts, such as represented by the Food Ontology (FoodOn) ‘Food product by organism’, which derives from some food or anatomical entity and a NCBI organismal classification ontology (NCBITaxon) entity. The common vocabulary and relationships defined within CDNO should facilitate description, communication and exchange of material entity-derived nutritional composition datasets typically generated by analytical laboratories. The organisation of the vocabulary is structured to reflect common categories variously used by those involved in crop, livestock or other organismal production, associated R&D and breeding, as well as the food processing and supply sector, and nutritionists, inlcuding compilers and users of food composition databases. The CDNO therefore supports characterisation of genetic diversity and management of biodiversity collections, as well as sharing of knowledge relating to dietary composition between a wider set of researchers, breeders, farmers, processors and other stakeholders. Further development of the functional class should also assist in understanding how interactions between organismal genetic and environmental variation contribute to human diet and health in the farm to fork continuum., None https://cdno.info/	name,description,homepage	0.9917173981666565

At present many parts of the model are exploratory and set to undergo refactoring.  In addition, many classes and properties have GENO URIs but are place holders for classes that will be imported from an external ontology (e.g. SO, ChEBI, OBI, etc).  Furthermore, ongoing work will implement a model of genotype-to-phenotype associations. This will support description of asserted and inferred relationships between a genotypes, phenotypes, and environments, and the evidence/provenance behind these associations.

tgn	bartoc	109	Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names TGN is a structured vocabulary currently containing around 1,106,000 names and other information about places. Names for a place may include names in the vernacular language, English, other languages, historical names, names and in natural order and inverted order. Among these names, one is flagged as the preferred name. TGN is a thesaurus, compliant with ISO and NISO standards for thesaurus construction; it contains hierarchical, equivalence, and associative relationships. Note that TGN is not a GIS (Geographic Information System). While many records in TGN include coordinates, these coordinates are approximate and are intended for reference only. The focus of each TGN record is a place. There are around 912,000 places in the TGN. In the database, each place record (also called a subject) is identified by a unique numeric ID. Linked to the record for the place are names, the place's parent or position in the hierarchy, other relationships, geographic coordinates, notes, sources for the data, and place types, which are terms describing the role of the place (e.g., inhabited place and state capital). The temporal coverage of the TGN ranges from prehistory to the present and the scope is global. The TGN is a hierarchical database; its trees branch from a root called Top of the TGN hierarchies (Subject_ID: 1000000). Currently there are two TGN facets, World and Extraterrestrial Places. Under the facet World, places are arranged in hierarchies generally representing the current political and physical world, although some historical nations and empires are also included. There may be multiple broader contexts, making the TGN polyhierarchical. The primary users of the Getty vocabularies include museums, art libraries, archives, visual resource collection catalogers, bibliographic projects concerned with art, researchers in art and art history, and the information specialists who are dealing with the needs of these users. In addition, a significant number of users of the Getty vocabularies are students or members of the general public. http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/	name,description,homepage	0.9951262474060059

dolce	fairsharing	FAIRsharing.ae8hpt	Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering) is a foundational ontology developed as part of the WonderWeb Foundational Ontologies Library (WFOL).  The development of this library has been guided by the need of a reliable set of foundational ontologies that can serve as 1) astarting point for building other ontologies, 2) a reference point for easy and rigorous comparisons among different ontological approaches, and 3) a rigorous basis for analyzing, harmonizing and integrating existing ontologies and metadata standards (by manually mapping them into some general module(s) in the library). DOLCE is the first module of WFOL and it is not a candidate for a universal standard ontology. Rather, it is intended as a starting point for comparing and elucidating the relationships with the other modules of the library, and also for clarifying the hidden assumptions underlying existing ontologies or linguistic resources such as WordNet.  As reflected by its acronym, DOLCE has a clear cognitive bias, in the sense that it aims at capturing the ontological categories underlying natural language and human commonsense. DOLCE is an ontology that focuses on particulars in the sense that its domain of discourse is restricted to them. The project is complete, though the ontology remains available for use. http://www.loa.istc.cnr.it/dolce/overview.html	name,description,homepage	0.9952034950256348
