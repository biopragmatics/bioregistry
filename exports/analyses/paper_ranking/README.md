# Title TF-IDF Analysis

![](outline.png)

We searched for articles published in 2021 indexed in PubMed that contained one of the following in its title:

1. database
2. ontology
3. vocabulary
4. nomenclature
5. resource

Of the resulting articles, we curated a random 10% as relevant or not based on title. We featurized these titles
using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), trained/evaluated a binary classifier, then predicted
scores for the remaining publications ([`predictions.tsv`](predictions.tsv)). These can be directly curated either by

1. Add the publication to an existing prefix
2. Make a [new prefix request](https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioregistry/issues/new/choose) for the identifier
   resource described by the article

For reference, the relative importance of each feature(i.e., word) is available in [`importances.tsv`](importances.tsv).
This analysis can be re-run with `python -m bioregistry.analysis.title_tfidf`.
A [presentation](https://bit.ly/wpci2022-bioregistry-maintenance) on this workflow was given at
the [2022 Workshop on Prefixes, CURIEs, and IRIs](https://biopragmatics.github.io/workshops/WPCI2022).
