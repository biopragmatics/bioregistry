aberowl	AberOWL	http://aber-owl.net	AberOWL is a framework for ontology-based access to biological data. It consists of a repository of bio-ontologies, a set of webservices which provide access to OWL(-EL) reasoning over the ontologies, and several frontends which utilise the ontology repository and reasoning services to provide access to specific biological datasets.	http://aber-owl.net/api/ontology/?format=json	CHEBI	ali.syed@kaust.edu.sa	http://aber-owl.net/ontology/$1	http://aber-owl.net/ontology/$1/#/Browse/<http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2F$1_$2>	lookup
