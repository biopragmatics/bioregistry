# Contexts Exports

This directory contains fit-for-purpose exports of JSON-LD contexts.

### Generated via Collections

Some are generated based on collections that contain a `context` key
corresponding to the filename `<context>.context.jsonld`. For example,
[`semweb.context.jsonld`](semweb.context.jsonld) groups several semantic web
resources like `dcterms`, `rdf`, and `owl`.

### Generated via code

The rest are generated by specific code written in
the `bioregistry.export.prefix_maps` module. For
example, [`obo.context.jsonld`](oobo.context.jsonld)
contains a mapping with prefixes and URI prefixes prioritized for the OBO
Foundry and ontology contexts.
