# Contexts Exports

This directory contains fit-for-purpose exports of JSON-LD contexts as well
as [SHACL](https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioregistry/issues/305)
formatted exports.

### Generated via Collections

Some are generated based on collections that contain a `context` key
corresponding to the filename `<context>.context.jsonld`. For example,
[`semweb.context.jsonld`](semweb.context.jsonld) groups several semantic web
resources like `dcterms`, `rdf`, and `owl`.

### Generated via code

The rest are generated by specific code written in
the `bioregistry.export.prefix_maps` module.

## Prescriptive Contexts

As a follow-up to https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioregistry/issues/324, the
Bioregistry has updated its context export to be more configurable.

### Governance

To ensure stability and reliability for communities that might want to rely on
these contexts, they were suggested to be only editable by specific people
responsible for the communities that each context is for. To mitigate the
possibility of gridlock due to this bottleneck, we institute the following
rules:

#### Adding a Context

- Anyone is allowed to create a context given they're prepared to follow the
  governance rules.
- A discussion for a new context can be made via the Bioregistry's issue
  tracker, but only a pull request counts as a proposal.
- New contexts must pass all CI tests before being considered.
- The Bioregistry Review Team is responsible for reviewing all new context
  requests and accepts at their discretion.
- Each context must have a unique key. Similar rules to choosing a good prefix
  in the Bioregistry apply.
- Each context must list its maintainers along with their current GitHub, ORCID,
  and optional email.
- Each context must include a name and description
- This README should also be updated to reflect new contexts (though this might
  be automated in the future.)

#### Editing a pre-existing context

- Changes to contexts must always be made via pull requests.
- Changes must pass all CI tests to be considered for acceptance. These tests
  can be updated at the discretion of the Bioregistry Core Development Team.
- Changes can only be accepted and merged with the public consent of at least
  one of the maintainers on either the issue motivating the change or pull
  request substantiating it.
- A maintainer can not consent their own (suggested) changes, i.e., in this
  case, a second maintainer must also publicly agree.
- Maintainers for contexts do not necessarily need to be part of the
  Bioregistry's Review Team.
- If the maintainers publicly state disagreement on a change, then they are
  allowed two (2) weeks for deliberation. If a consensus can not be met, then
  the changes are dismissed.
- If a maintainer is pinged on the Bioregistry issue tracker regarding one of
  the contexts for which they are responsible, they have four (4) weeks to
  respond otherwise they will be removed as a maintainer.
- Changes to the Prescriptive Context Governance must be solicited via the
  Bioregistry's public issue tracker and approved by the Bioregistry Review
  Team.

#### Maintaining a context

- A technical solution based on CI/CD and GitHub's API will be used to randomly
  ping maintainers to check that they are still available on GitHub.
- Maintainers may unanimously nominate additional maintainers to be added at the
  discretion of the Bioregistry Review Team. This discretion is to prevent
  adding maintainers who will likely be non-responsive and/or non-engaged.
- If there are fewer than two maintainers listed for any context, then the
  Bioregistry Review Team automatically gains rights as an interim maintainer
  until there are two or more maintainers.
- If there are no maintainers for a given context, e.g., if all maintainers have
  been unavailable and have lost maintainer rights, then the Bioregistry Review
  Team may assign two maintainers at their discretion and then abdicate its
  responsibility as the maintainer of the context. It is advised not to
  re-assign previous maintainers who abdicated responsibility.

#### Removing a context

- In general, contexts should not be deleted.
- Contexts that are created then immediately abandoned are subject to removal

#### Bootstrapping governance

Governance will go into effect either after the second maintainer is added to
the OBO entry or when a second context is added, after which this notice can be
removed.

#### Updating governance

This governance must updated through the following steps:

1. Create an issue on the
   Bioregistry's [issue tracker](https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioregistry/issues)
   describing the desired change and reasoning
2. Engage potential stakeholders in discussion
3. Solicit the Bioregistry Review Team for a review
4. The Bioregistry Review Team will accept changes at their discretion.

This procedure doesn't apply to cosmetic or ergonomics changes, which are
allowed to be done in a more *ad-hoc* manner. The Bioregistry Review Team may
later make explicit criteria for accepting changes to this governance.

### How to Edit

The `contexts.json` file can be edited in the following ways:

1. Click [here](https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioregistry/edit/main/src/bioregistry/data/collections.json)
   to edit on GitHub. This will automatically create a fork and prompt you to issue
   a pull request (just press the green buttons).
2. Make a fork and issue a pull request.
3. Open an issue.

Be sure to tag the maintainers listed in the context in all issues and pull
requests.
