To achieve this goal SNP-Ontology enables (1) to represent one variation in accordance with various ways that exist for describing it, (2) to represent the equivalence between two distinct descriptions of one variation, and (3) to represent correspondence between a genomic variation and its outcome at the transcriptome and proteome levels.","documentation":null,"publication":"http://hal.inria.fr/inria-00067863/en","publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2017-03-14T00:00:00","date_created":"2009-01-16T00:19:40","home_page":"https://members.loria.fr/ACoulet/files/snpontology1.6_description.html","version":"version: full 1.6\nrelease: 14/03/2017","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":0,"nb_individuals":0,"nb_properties":0,"max_depth":0,"max_children":0,"avg_children":0,"classifiable":false,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":false,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"MDDB","name":"Master Drug Data Base Clinical Drugs","status":"Unloadable","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":282,"download_url":"media/ontologies/MDDB/9/mddb.umls","submission_id":9,"domain":null,"description":"Master Drug Data Base, 2009_08_05","documentation":"http://www.medispan.com","publication":"http://www.medispan.com","publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2017-02-06T21:26:10","date_created":"2017-02-06T21:26:11","home_page":"http://www.medispan.com","version":"2016AB","has_ontology_language":"UMLS","nb_classes":13651,"nb_individuals":0,"nb_properties":1,"max_depth":0,"max_children":0,"avg_children":0,"classifiable":false,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":false,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"TESTUDEM2222","name":"TestUdeM2222","status":"Unknown","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":null},{"acronym":"EXACT","name":"An ontology for experimental actions","status":"Unloadable","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":671,"download_url":"media/ontologies/EXACT/2/exact.owl","submission_id":2,"domain":null,"description":"EXACT aims to explicitly define the semantics of experimental protocols in order to ensure their reproducibility, and to support computer applications that assist biologists in the preparation, maintenance, submission and sharing of experimental protocols.

It facilitates tracking specific pandemic cases, detailing how patients may have been infected, and identifying potential contacts at risk due to their connection with the infected individual. CODO also enables monitoring of clinical tests, travel history, available resources, and actual needs like ICU beds and invasive ventilators. With capabilities for advanced analytics, contact tracing, trend studies, and growth projections based on daily COVID-19 data, CODO supports the organization and representation of COVID-19 data on a daily basis. It allows semantic querying and data retrieval and aids in behavior analysis of the disease and transmission routes.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, Version 1.4, also known as CODO_COVIDRO 1.4 or COVID-19 Drug and Risk Ontology (COViDRO), presents a formal model specifically designed to tackle the multifaceted challenges associated with COVID-19 treatment, risk factors, and drug interactions. The knowledge embedded in the COViDRO model is extracted from diverse medical literature and treatment guidelines provided by reputable organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The model incorporates information on therapeutics, adverse effects, and drug interactions from authoritative medical literature, making a significant contribution to patient care, research, and public health strategies.\r\n\r\nCOViDRO, or COVID-19 Drug and Risk Ontology 1.4, seamlessly integrates into knowledge graph information systems or recommender systems. It assists healthcare professionals in suggesting appropriate treatments by considering a comprehensive set of factors, abbreviated as \"PRADiCT\" (Patient Risk factors, Adverse effects, Drug interaction, Clinical findings, and Treatment procedure). These factors encompass patient risk level, risk factors (such as underlying health conditions, age, immunocompromised state, and occupation), drug interactions, drug adverse effects, clinical findings (including diagnosis, signs, symptoms, and status), and treatment procedures.\r\n\r\nBy offering a standardized framework for organizing and integrating data from diverse sources like clinical trials, medical literature, and real-world patient data, COViDRO enhances informed decision-making, thereby elevating the quality of patient care. It stands as a patient-centric solution, facilitating COVID-19 treatment options and personalized care based on individual patient characteristics. \r\n\r\nCODO V1.5 extends the previous CODO V1.4 with the focus on COVID-19 Virus Genomics for representation of genomic sequence data. VGO model comprises 261 classes, 55 object properties, and 14 data properties. Designed to streamline the use and dissemination of COVID-19 genomic sequence data, VGO serves as a robust resource for researchers and healthcare professionals. It incorporates data from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), which facilitates efficient querying and visualization of genomic data, thereby improving both accessibility and usability. VGO includes a variety of classes that represent COVID-19-related data such as variants, mutations, amino acids, genes, proteins, genome sequencing, samples, hosts, sampling strategies, and assembly methods. Furthermore, VGO supports automated reasoning, enhancing its functionality for in-depth analysis and interpretation. By integrating GISAID data into the VGO knowledge graph, the model not only enriches its conceptual representation but also optimizes the querying and visualization processes, making genomic data more accessible and usable for the scientific and medical communities.","documentation":"https://w3id.org/codo","publication":"https://www.isibang.ac.in/~bisu/covid19project.html","publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2023-07-26T00:00:00","date_created":"2024-05-29T11:20:14","home_page":"https://github.com/biswanathdutta/CODO","version":"1.5","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":385,"nb_individuals":767,"nb_properties":214,"max_depth":7,"max_children":37,"avg_children":3,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"COHSI2STUDY","name":"cohsi2study","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":5352,"download_url":"media/ontologies/COHSI2STUDY/27/cohsi2study.skos","submission_id":27,"domain":null,"description":"These ontologies are created under the CoHSI2 Study.","documentation":null,"publication":null,"publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2021-11-26T00:00:00","date_created":"2022-09-12T05:59:40","home_page":null,"version":"0.2.8","has_ontology_language":"SKOS","nb_classes":2,"nb_individuals":83,"nb_properties":0,"max_depth":1,"max_children":2,"avg_children":2,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"COHSI2TERMSWEEKX","name":"cohsi2termsweekx","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":5348,"download_url":"media/ontologies/COHSI2TERMSWEEKX/1/cohsi2termsweekx.skos","submission_id":1,"domain":null,"description":"Vocabularies are created to descibe week X report for CoHSI2 study","documentation":null,"publication":null,"publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2022-09-11T00:00:00","date_created":"2022-09-11T20:59:45","home_page":null,"version":null,"has_ontology_language":"SKOS","nb_classes":2,"nb_individuals":32,"nb_properties":0,"max_depth":1,"max_children":2,"avg_children":2,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"SPRUCHE","name":"All Germany ontology","status":"Unknown","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":null},{"acronym":"D3O","name":"DSMZ Digital Diversity Ontology","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":6890,"download_url":"media/ontologies/D3O/3/d3o.owl","submission_id":3,"domain":null,"description":"The DSMZ Digital Diversity Ontology (D3O) is an ontology designed to standardize and integrate data related to microbial diversity and associated resources within the context of the DSMZ’s Digital Diversity Knowledge Graph.

To this aim, data producers need to master data management and reporting\r\nthrough standard and rich metadata, as encouraged by open data initiatives such as\r\nthe FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) guidelines. This helps data re-users to understand and reuse the shared data with confidence. Therefore, dedicated frameworks are required. The provenance reporting throughout a biomedical study lifecycle has been proposed as a way to increase confidence in data while reusing it. The Biomedical Study - Lifecycle Management (BMS-LM) data model has implemented provenance and lifecycle traceability for several multimodal-imaging techniques but this is not enough for data understanding while reusing it. Actually, in the large scope of biomedical research, a multitude of metadata sources, also called Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs), are available for data annotation. In addition, data producers uses local terminologies or KOSs, containing vernacular\r\nterms for data reporting. The result is a set of heterogeneous KOSs (local and published) with different formats and levels of granularity. To manage the inherent heterogeneity, semantic interoperability is encouraged by the Research Data\r\nManagement (RDM) community. Ontologies, and more specifically top ontologies such as BFO and DOLCE, make explicit the metadata semantics and enhance semantic interoperability. Based on the BMS-LM data model and the BFO top ontology, the BioMedical Study - Lifecycle Management (BMS-LM) core ontology is proposed together with an associated framework for semantic interoperability between heterogeneous KOSs. It is made of four ontological levels: top/core/domain/local and\r\naims to build bridges between local and published KOSs. In this paper, the conversion of the BMS-LM data model to a core ontology is detailed. The implementation of its semantic interoperability in a specific domain context is explained and illustrated with examples from small animal preclinical research.","documentation":null,"publication":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2022.104007","publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2022-02-01T00:00:00","date_created":"2023-02-01T11:42:37","home_page":null,"version":"Version 1.1","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":154,"nb_individuals":22,"nb_properties":98,"max_depth":9,"max_children":12,"avg_children":2,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"HPV","name":"HPV Cancer Dictionary","status":"Unknown","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":null},{"acronym":"ADW","name":"Animal Natural History and Life History Ontology","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":616,"download_url":"media/ontologies/ADW/2/adw.owl","submission_id":2,"domain":null,"description":"An ontology for animal life history and natural history characteristics suitable for populations and higher taxonomic entities.","documentation":"http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/about/technology/index.html","publication":null,"publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2010-08-31T07:00:00","date_created":"2010-09-01T05:37:48","home_page":"http://www.animaldiversity.org","version":"10/11/04","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":364,"nb_individuals":26,"nb_properties":81,"max_depth":4,"max_children":21,"avg_children":6,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"BT-ONTOLOGY","name":"BrainTeaser Ontology (BTO)","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":6770,"download_url":"media/ontologies/BT-ONTOLOGY/3/bt-ontology.owl","submission_id":3,"domain":null,"description":"BrainTeaser Ontology (BTO) whose purpose is to jointly model both Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS).\r\n\r\nThe BTO serves multiple purposes:\r\n\r\n- to provide a unified and comprehensive conceptual view about ALS and MS, which are typically dealt with separately, allowing us to coherently integrate the data coming from the different medical partners in the project;\r\n- to seamlessly represent both retrospective data and prospective data, produced during the lifetime of BRAINTEASER\r\n- to allow for sharing and re-using the BRAINTEASER datasets according to Open Science and FAIR principles.\r\n\r\nFor more details, visit the BTO documentation page: https://brainteaser.dei.unipd.it/ontology/","documentation":"https://brainteaser.dei.unipd.it/ontology/","publication":null,"publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2024-07-22T01:00:44","date_created":"2024-07-22T01:00:48","home_page":"https://brainteaser.dei.unipd.it/ontology/","version":"2.0","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":180,"nb_individuals":816,"nb_properties":68,"max_depth":5,"max_children":42,"avg_children":3,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"CARELEX","name":"Content Archive Resource Exchange Lexicon","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":769,"download_url":"media/ontologies/CARELEX/43/carelex.owl","submission_id":43,"domain":null,"description":"Contains controlled vocabulary terms from National Cancer Institute used to classify clinical trial electronic content (documents, images, etc).

The CCF Ontology consists of three major ontologies. The Biological Structure Ontology records anatomical structures, cell types, and biomarkers (ASCT+B) and the relationships between them.  The ASCT+B tables are authored by human experts using templated Google Sheets. The biomarkers, cell types, and anatomical structures are mapped to existing ontologies (Uberon/FMA, CL, HGNC) whenever possible.  All relationships between anatomical structures and from cell types to anatomical structures are valid Uberon and CL relationships. The Spatial Ontology defines the shape, size, location, and rotation of experimental tissue and data major anatomical structures in the 3D Reference Object Library. The Specimen Ontology captures the sex, age, and other information on donors that provided tissue data used in the construction of the HRA.","documentation":"https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf/pages/ccf-ontology.html","publication":"https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf/","publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2024-06-14T00:00:00","date_created":"2024-06-14T18:30:58","home_page":"https://lod.humanatlas.io/vocab/ccf/latest","version":"3.0.0","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":41,"nb_individuals":9,"nb_properties":3,"max_depth":2,"max_children":21,"avg_children":4,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"QUDT2-1","name":"Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Types (QUDT Version 2.1)","status":"Unknown","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":null},{"acronym":"URLO","name":"Uniform Resource Locator Ontology","status":"Unknown","topics":[],"species":[],"submission":null},{"acronym":"OGCO","name":"OriGinal Chemical Ontology","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":7111,"download_url":"media/ontologies/OGCO/1/ogco.owl","submission_id":1,"domain":null,"description":"The Original Chemical Ontology was developed by Michael Ashburner & Pankaj Jaiswal in 2002, before development shifted to CHEBI.

Ontologies are an adequate framework to overcome this limitation, through their axiomatic definitions and logical reasoning prop-erties.

It is a component of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project (https://commonfund.nih.gov/idg). The DTO project develops a novel semantic framework to formalize knowledge about drug targets with a focus on the current IDG protein families. The DTO is developed as a reference for drug targets with the longer-term goal to create a community standard that will facilitate the integration of diverse drug discovery information from numerous heterogeneous resources. The first version of the DTO consists of asserted class hierarchies of the four IDG protein families, GPCRs, kinases, ion channels, and nuclear hormone receptors. Protein classes are linked to tissue and disease via different levels of confidence. DTO also contains drug target development level classifications developed in the IDG project (http://targetcentral.ws/), and functional and qualitative annotations and classifications for kinase proteins, GPCR ligands and ion channels. DTO is modeled in OWL2-DL to enable further classification by inference reasoning and SPARQL queries. DTO is implemented following a modularization approach. DTO is used as the organizational framework for drug targets in the IDG PHAROS User Interface Portal (https://pharos.nih.gov) and also the Tin-X Target Importance and Novelty Explorer (http://newdrugtargets.org).","documentation":"http://drugtargetontology.org/","publication":"http://drugtargetontology.org/","publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2017-12-08T02:01:34","date_created":"2017-12-08T02:01:35","home_page":"http://drugtargetontology.org/","version":"1.1","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":10075,"nb_individuals":3,"nb_properties":42,"max_depth":11,"max_children":636,"avg_children":4,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"EFO","name":"Experimental Factor Ontology","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":87,"download_url":"media/ontologies/EFO/168/efo.owl","submission_id":168,"domain":null,"description":"The Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) is an application focused ontology modelling the experimental variables in multiple resources at the EBI and Open Targets.

The domain that has been chosen is human nervous system (HNS) disorders. It is hypothesized here that an ontology-based patient records management system is more effective in meeting and addressing complex information needs of health-care personnel. Therefore, this study has been based on the premise that developing an ontology and using it as a component of the search interface in hospital records management systems will lead to more efficient and effective management of health-care. It is proposed here to develop an ontology of the domain of HNS disorders using a standard vocabulary such as MeSH or SNOMED CT. The principal classes of an ontology include facet analysis for arranging concepts based on their common characteristics to build mutually exclusive classes. We combine faceted theory with description logic, which helps us to better query and retrieve data by implementing an ontological model. Protégé 5.2.0 was used as ontology editor. The use of ontologies for domain modelling will be of acute help to doctors for searching patient records. In this paper we show how the faceted approach helps us to build a flexible model and retrieve better information.

BAO is an extensible, knowledge-based, highly expressive (currently SHOIQ(D)) description of biological assays making use of descriptive logic based features of the Web Ontology Language (OWL).  BAO currently has over 1000 classes and also makes use of several other ontologies.  It describes several concepts related to biological screening, including Perturbagen, Format, Meta Target, Design,  Detection Technology, and Endpoint.  Perturbagens are perturbing agents that are screened in an assay; they are mostly small molecules. Assay Meta Target describes what is known about the biological system and / or its components interrogated in the assay (and influenced by the Perturbagen).  Meta target can be directly described as a molecular entity (e.g. a purified protein or a protein complex), or indirectly by a biological process or event (e.g. phosphorylation).  Format describes the biological or chemical features common to each test condition in the assay and includes biochemical, cell-based, organism-based, and variations thereof.  The assay Design describes the assay methodology and implementation of how the perturbation of the biological system is translated into a detectable signal.  Detection Technology relates to the physical method and technical details to detect and record a signal.  Endpoints are the final HTS results as they are usually published (such as IC50, percent inhibition, etc.).  BAO has been designed to accommodate multiplexed assays.  All main BAO components include multiple levels of sub-categories and specification classes, which are linked via object property relationships forming an expressive knowledge-based representation.","documentation":"http://www.bioassayontology.org/","publication":"http://www.bioassayontology.org/","publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2017-10-05T01:00:16","date_created":"2017-10-05T01:00:16","home_page":"http://www.bioassayontology.org/","version":"2.3.3","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":7125,"nb_individuals":1,"nb_properties":223,"max_depth":13,"max_children":178,"avg_children":3,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"ACGT-MO","name":"Cancer Research and Management ACGT Master Ontology","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":571,"download_url":"media/ontologies/ACGT-MO/2/acgt-mo.owl","submission_id":2,"domain":null,"description":"The intention of the ACGT Master Ontology (MO) is to represent the domain of cancer research and management in a computationally tractable manner.","documentation":"http://www.ifomis.org/acgt","publication":"http://www.ifomis.org/acgt","publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2010-01-03T08:00:00","date_created":"2010-03-17T10:04:50","home_page":"http://www.ifomis.org/acgt","version":"1.1","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":1770,"nb_individuals":61,"nb_properties":260,"max_depth":18,"max_children":66,"avg_children":3,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"iceci-descriptor_for_intent","name":"iceci-descriptor_for_intent","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":273,"download_url":"media/ontologies/iceci-descriptor_for_intent/3/iceci-descriptor_for_intent.owl","submission_id":3,"domain":null,"description":"ICECI Descriptors for Intent V.1 - V.7","documentation":null,"publication":null,"publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2010-05-10T07:00:00","date_created":"2010-05-10T22:17:13","home_page":null,"version":"1.02","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":217,"nb_individuals":214,"nb_properties":7,"max_depth":4,"max_children":9,"avg_children":5,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"BAO-GPCR","name":"G Protein-Coupled Receptor BioAssays Ontology","status":"Unloadable","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":182,"download_url":"media/ontologies/BAO-GPCR/23/bao-gpcr.owl","submission_id":23,"domain":null,"description":"The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) ontology (http://www.bioassayontology.org/bao_gpcr) describes pharmacology, biochemistry and physiology of these important and therapeutically promising class of academic and pharmaceutical research targets.

In order to bridge the gap between the overflow of HTS data and the bottleneck of integrated analysis tools, herein, we provide the first comprehensive GPCR ontology. The development and utility of GPCR ontology was based on previously developed BioAssay Ontology (BAO). The GPCR ontology contains information about biochemical, pharmacological, and functional properties of individual GPCRs as well as GPCR-selective ligands inclusive of their HTS screening results and other records. This provides the first all-inclusive GPCR ontology with all available data to model the relationship between the GPCR binding sites and their physiologic and pharmacologic role in physiology via small molecule chemical structures. We developed this system using emerging semantic technologies, by leveraging existing and descriptive domain level ontologies.","documentation":"https://github.com/BioAssayOntology","publication":"http://www.schurerlab.org/home/publications","publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2013-10-28T23:31:51","date_created":"2013-10-28T23:31:54","home_page":"http://www.bioassayontology.org/","version":"1.1","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":904,"nb_individuals":345,"nb_properties":36,"max_depth":4,"max_children":321,"avg_children":9,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"iceci-details_for_activity","name":"iceci-details_for_activity","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":33,"download_url":"media/ontologies/iceci-details_for_activity/3/iceci-details_for_activity.owl","submission_id":3,"domain":null,"description":"ICICI Details for activity O1-O2 and S1-S2","documentation":null,"publication":null,"publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2010-05-10T07:00:00","date_created":"2010-05-10T22:19:04","home_page":null,"version":"1.02","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":333,"nb_individuals":330,"nb_properties":7,"max_depth":3,"max_children":34,"avg_children":11,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"iceci-details_for_mechanism","name":"iceci-details_for_mechanism","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":118,"download_url":"media/ontologies/iceci-details_for_mechanism/2/iceci-details_for_mechanism.owl","submission_id":2,"domain":null,"description":"ICECI Details for Mechanism T1 - T4","documentation":null,"publication":null,"publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2010-05-07T07:00:00","date_created":"2010-05-07T20:57:20","home_page":null,"version":"1.02","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":159,"nb_individuals":156,"nb_properties":7,"max_depth":4,"max_children":17,"avg_children":5,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"iceci-details_for_place_of_occurrence","name":"iceci-details_for_place_of_occurrence","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":397,"download_url":"media/ontologies/iceci-details_for_place_of_occurrence/2/iceci-details_for_place_of_occurrence.owl","submission_id":2,"domain":null,"description":"ICECI Details for place of occurrence P1-P7","documentation":null,"publication":null,"publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2010-05-07T07:00:00","date_created":"2010-05-07T20:58:40","home_page":null,"version":"1.02","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":61,"nb_individuals":58,"nb_properties":7,"max_depth":2,"max_children":24,"avg_children":6,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"BCI-O","name":"Brain-Computer Interaction (BCI) Ontology","status":"Unloadable","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":1557,"download_url":"media/ontologies/BCI-O/6/bci-o.owl","submission_id":6,"domain":null,"description":"The BCI ontology specifies a foundational metadata model set for real-world multimodal Brain-Computer Interaction (BCI) data capture activities.

For creating such an ontology, information was obtained from a wide range of information sources involved with brain tumour study and research. The information thus obtained was compiled and analysed to provide a standard, reliable and relevant information base to aid our proposed system. Facet-based methodology has been used for ontology formalization for quite some time. Ontology formalization involves different steps such as identification of the terminology, analysis, synthesis, standardization and ordering. A vast majority of the ontologies being developed nowadays lack flexibility. This becomes a formidable constraint when it comes to interoperability. We found that a facet-based method provides a distinct guideline for the development of a robust and flexible model concerning the domain of brain tumours. Our attempt has been to bridge library and information science and computer science, which itself involved an experimental approach. It was discovered that a faceted approach is really enduring, as it helps in the achievement of properties like navigation, exploration and faceted browsing. Computer-based brain tumour ontology supports the work of researchers towards gathering information on brain tumour research and allows users across the world to intelligently access new scientific information quickly and efficiently.","documentation":"https://github.com/subhashishhh/BTO-Ontology","publication":"Das, Subhashis, and Sayon Roy. \"Faceted Ontological Model for Brain Tumour Study.\" KO KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION 43, no. 1 (2016): 3-12.","publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2016-01-01T00:00:00","date_created":"2020-05-04T09:51:06","home_page":"https://github.com/subhashishhh/BTO-Ontology/blob/master/BrainTumour_ontology.owl","version":"1","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":28,"nb_individuals":146,"nb_properties":9,"max_depth":4,"max_children":11,"avg_children":4,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"IDQA","name":"Image and Data Quality Assessment Ontology","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":417,"download_url":"media/ontologies/IDQA/8/idqa.obo","submission_id":8,"domain":null,"description":"Image and Data Quality Assessment for scientific data management","documentation":null,"publication":null,"publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2013-08-25T07:00:00","date_created":"2013-12-05T22:14:47","home_page":"http://idqa.wordpress.com","version":"v50","has_ontology_language":"OBO","nb_classes":260,"nb_individuals":0,"nb_properties":2,"max_depth":8,"max_children":18,"avg_children":3,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"IFAR","name":"Fanconi Anemia Ontology","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":720,"download_url":"media/ontologies/IFAR/5/ifar.owl","submission_id":5,"domain":null,"description":"An application ontology devoted to the standardized recording of data related to Fanconi Anemia (FA).

The thesaurus combines both genres and forms. Form is defined as a characteristic of works with a particular format and/or purpose. A \"short\" is a particular form, for example, as is \"animation.\" Genre refers to categories of works that are characterized by similar plots, themes, settings, situations, and characters.

The annotation of natural science texts is more challenging than in other domains. Biomedical language is replete with ambiguity distinct from that observed in news articles or informal text online. In biomedical texts, alternative meanings are not always clearly separated.\r\n\r\nFor example, in some biomedical contexts, the words for a named entity may refer to a gene or a protein with nearly equal probability; for example, “a mutant hemoglobin α_2” can refer to either a gene or a protein. If the author meant gene-or-protein A, and we force an annotator to choose either interpretation gene A or protein A, the resulting annotation is of limited utility because the choice between gene and protein is random if the meanings are equally likely based on context.

Examples of genome editing technology applications with global significance include human cell-based therapeutics, agriculture, microbial based therapeutics, synthetic biology and biomanufacturing. While genome editing technology is being actively utilized, there is a need for international standardization in terms and definitions for this field, so as to enhance interpretation and communication of concepts, data and results. This document has been developed to provide a unified standard set of terms and definitions that serve the needs of biotechnology stakeholders and act as a reference for genome editing technology.","documentation":"https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/nist-genome-editing-lexicon","publication":"https://www.iso.org/standard/80679.html?browse=tc","publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2020-11-23T00:00:00","date_created":"2022-01-06T17:01:17","home_page":"https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/nist-genome-editing-lexicon","version":"2.1","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":52,"nb_individuals":0,"nb_properties":9,"max_depth":5,"max_children":9,"avg_children":4,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"ORDO_FR","name":"ORDO FRENCH","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":7049,"download_url":"media/ontologies/ORDO_FR/15/ordo_fr.owl","submission_id":15,"domain":null,"description":"This ontology is the french version of ORDO with definition, labels and synonyms in french.\r\nCette ontologie est la version française d'ORDO avec les définitions, labels et synonymes en français.","documentation":"https://www.orphadata.com/ordo/","publication":null,"publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2024-12-04T00:00:00","date_created":"2024-12-05T15:11:09","home_page":"https://www.orphadata.com/ordo/","version":"4.6","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":15579,"nb_individuals":0,"nb_properties":13,"max_depth":11,"max_children":4403,"avg_children":15,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"NMDCO","name":"NMDC Ontology","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":6469,"download_url":"media/ontologies/NMDCO/8/nmdco.owl","submission_id":8,"domain":null,"description":"The NMDC Ontology (NMDCO) is used by the National Microbiome Data Collaborative (NMDC, https://microbiomedata.org) to annotate multi-omic microbiome metadata.

It includes an extensive set of unit definitions (e.g., grams of carbon per liter of seawater), and can facilitate automatic unit conversions (e.g., pounds to kilograms).

In this study, we focus on the development and proposal of an ontology dedicated to the description of these experimental procedures, regardless of the scientific questions that prompted the assays. This ontology includes entities from three distinct realms (biological, physical and data), which include both experimental products, their relations and the protocols describing their manipulation.

The classes of PDO also capture the habitat, environmental conditions and expand the general characteristics of plants, completing the instances richness for plant species, geographical, classification and morphology. Furthermore, PDO builds the relationships among species, region, morphology, plant organs, developmental stage, revealing the list of species in an area, the morphology and life form of plants, and development process of species. In sum, PDO shows a growth process or development stage of a species and its structure characteristics in particular space and time scale, realizing the description of species diversity, ecosystem diversity and genetic diversity.

The ontology is available in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) format, and can be browsed and downloaded online: https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ISSVA\r\n\r\nHow to Use the ISSVA Ontology?\r\n\r\nThe ISSVA ontology does not substitute the ISSVA classification, instead, it should be used as an additional component to facilitate interoperability. Every concept in the ISSVA ontology has a unique code that should be attached to the corresponding data element. In the context of databases, the ISSVA ontology codes could be added as an extra column to the existing data. \r\n\r\nMappings to Other Ontologies?\r\n\r\nThe ISSVA ontology contains machine-readable mappings to equivalent concepts in other ontologies, namely: the Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO), SNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), National Cancer Institute thesaurus (NCIT), and the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). This means that data annotated with codes from the ISSVA ontology are interoperable with data annotated with the aforementioned ontologies, without any extra effort, as long as there exists a mapping between the concepts.\r\n\r\nIssue Reporting\r\n\r\nPlease contact ISSVA at info@issva.org in case you have any issues and/or feature requests for the ISSVA ontology. The ontology can then be updated accordingly.","documentation":"https://github.com/brunasv/ISSVA","publication":null,"publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2021-02-19T00:00:00","date_created":"2021-04-29T16:05:21","home_page":"https://www.issva.org","version":"1.1.3","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":194,"nb_individuals":5,"nb_properties":1,"max_depth":8,"max_children":40,"avg_children":6,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"NMOSP","name":"NeuroMorpho.Org species ontology","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":883,"download_url":"media/ontologies/NMOSP/18/nmosp.owl","submission_id":18,"domain":null,"description":"The species ontology of NeuroMorpho.Org was updated (OntoSearch v1.3) to map the new species and strains added in  NeuroMorpho.Org v6.3 release.","documentation":null,"publication":null,"publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2017-11-28T02:12:14","date_created":"2017-11-28T02:12:14","home_page":"NeuroMorpho.Org","version":"1.3","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":1562,"nb_individuals":191,"nb_properties":0,"max_depth":40,"max_children":408,"avg_children":3,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"RH-MESH","name":"Robert Hoehndorf Version of MeSH","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":253,"download_url":"media/ontologies/RH-MESH/3/rh-mesh.owl","submission_id":3,"domain":null,"description":"Medical Subjects Headings Thesaurus 2014, Modified version.\r\n\r\nThis is an OWL representation of MeSH so that it can be integrated with other ontologies represented in OWL.

two main goals MENELAS contributes to are to (i) Provide better account of and better access to medical information through natural languages in order to help physicians in their daily practice, and to (ii) Enhance European cooperation by multilingual access to standardised medical nomenclatures. The major achievements of MENELAS are the realisation of its two functional systems: (i) The Document Indexing System encodes free text PDSs into both an internal representation (a set of Conceptual Graphs) and international nomenclature codes (ICD-9-CM). Instances of the Document Indexing System have been realised for French, English and Dutch ; (ii) The Consultation System allows users to access the information contained in PDSs previously indexed by the Document Indexing System. The test domain for the project was coronary diseases. The existing prototype shows promising results for information retrieval from natural language PDSs and for automatically encoding PDSs into an existing classification such as ICD-9-CM.

We have adopted a bottom-up approach to modeling and we have revised the structure of SCO upon investigation of a few research studies (11 to be precise) from the Pharmacological Interventions (Chapter 8) and Cardiovascular Complications (Chapter 9) of the American Diabetes Association (ADA)’s Standards of Medical Care 2018 CPG. We enable deep drive visualizations driven off queries to knowledge graphs modeled on SCO, to help assist physician visualize the similarity of a patient to a study group, at a quick glance. We welcome contributions and suggestions to extend SCO to represent cohort descriptions of publications targeted to other diseases, and we plan to release set of tools to make this process seamless.","documentation":"https://tetherless-world.github.io/study-cohort-ontology/ontology-resource","publication":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-30796-7_4","publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2019-04-18T00:00:00","date_created":"2020-07-02T20:24:40","home_page":"https://tetherless-world.github.io/study-cohort-ontology/","version":"1.1.0","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":3542,"nb_individuals":128,"nb_properties":560,"max_depth":14,"max_children":118,"avg_children":3,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"CHEMINF","name":"Chemical Information Ontology","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":7196,"download_url":"media/ontologies/CHEMINF/50/cheminf.owl","submission_id":50,"domain":"chemistry and biochemistry","description":"Includes terms for the descriptors commonly used in cheminformatics software applications and the algorithms which generate them.","documentation":null,"publication":null,"publications":[{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21991315","title":"The chemical information ontology: provenance and disambiguation for chemical data on the biological semantic web"}],"products":[{"id":"cheminf.owl","ontology_purl":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/cheminf.owl"}],"taxon":null,"date_released":"2025-02-24T12:23:41.572214","date_created":"2025-02-24T12:23:41.572219","home_page":"https://github.com/semanticchemistry/semanticchemistry","version":null,"has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":855,"nb_individuals":20,"nb_properties":111,"max_depth":12,"max_children":39,"avg_children":11,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":15,"indexed":true,"md5sum":"e2a8909ffd3d0d37f327b2b9ca114672"}},{"acronym":"LOINC","name":"Logical Observation Identifier Names and Codes","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":302,"download_url":"media/ontologies/LOINC/12/loinc.umls","submission_id":12,"domain":null,"description":"Logical Observation Identifier Names and Codes (LOINC)","documentation":"http://loinc.org/downloads","publication":"http://loinc.org/downloads","publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2017-02-06T21:26:07","date_created":"2017-02-06T21:26:07","home_page":"http://loinc.org/downloads","version":"2016AB","has_ontology_language":"UMLS","nb_classes":192372,"nb_individuals":0,"nb_properties":152,"max_depth":16,"max_children":10786,"avg_children":5,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":0,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"LONGCOVID","name":"Long Covid Phenotype Ontology","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":4588,"download_url":"media/ontologies/LONGCOVID/2/longcovid.owl","submission_id":2,"domain":null,"description":"Long Covid phenotype ontology","documentation":null,"publication":null,"publications":null,"products":null,"taxon":null,"date_released":"2021-10-06T00:00:00","date_created":"2021-10-05T16:48:57","home_page":null,"version":"20211006","has_ontology_language":"OWL","nb_classes":12,"nb_individuals":0,"nb_properties":0,"max_depth":4,"max_children":6,"avg_children":3,"classifiable":true,"nb_inconsistent":6,"indexed":true,"md5sum":null}},{"acronym":"LPT","name":"Livestock Product Trait Ontology","status":"Classified","topics":null,"species":null,"submission":{"id":283,"download_url":"media/ontologies/LPT/3/lpt.obo","submission_id":3,"domain":null,"description":"The Livestock Product Trait Ontology is a controlled vocabulary for the description of traits (measurable or observable characteristics) pertaining to products produced by or obtained from the body of an agricultural animal or bird maintained for use and profit.
