# Collections Exports

This directory contains derived files from the collections. The reference file
can be accessed
[here](https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioregistry/raw/main/src/bioregistry/data/collections.json).

### [`collections.yml`](collections.yml)

This is exactly the same as the source `collections.json` file, but converted to
the YAML format.

### [`collections.tsv`](collections.tsv)

This is an alternative representation of the `collections.json` but in TSV.
Pipes are used to concatenate several fields together, such as the list of
resources and authors associated with each collection.
