ccf	Human Reference Atlas Common Coordinate Framework Ontology	https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/CCF	The Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) Ontology is an application ontology built to support the development of the Human Reference Atlas (HRA).  It unifies vocabulary for HRA construction and usage—making it possible to ingest external data sources; supporting uniform tissue sample registration that includes the spatial positioning and semantic annotations within 3D reference organs; and supporting user-formulated cross-domain queries over tissue donor properties, anatomical structures, cell types, biomarkers, and 3D space. The CCF Ontology consists of three major ontologies. The Biological Structure Ontology records anatomical structures, cell types, and biomarkers (ASCT+B) and the relationships between them.  The ASCT+B tables are authored by human experts using templated Google Sheets. The biomarkers, cell types, and anatomical structures are mapped to existing ontologies (Uberon/FMA, CL, HGNC) whenever possible.  All relationships between anatomical structures and from cell types to anatomical structures are valid Uberon and CL relationships. The Spatial Ontology defines the shape, size, location, and rotation of experimental tissue and data major anatomical structures in the 3D Reference Object Library. The Specimen Ontology captures the sex, age, and other information on donors that provided tissue data used in the construction of the HRA.	^\S+$	extraction_set	katy@indiana.edu	https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/CCF/?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Fccf%2F$1				False	CCF				CCF										ccf				r3d100012657

cdao	Comparative Data Analysis Ontology	https://github.com/evoinfo/cdao	The Comparative Data Analysis Ontology (CDAO) provides a framework for understanding data in the context of evolutionary-comparative analysis.  This comparative approach is used commonly in bioinformatics and other areas of biology to draw inferences from a comparison of differently evolved versions of something, such as differently evolved versions of a protein.  In this kind of analysis, the things-to-be-compared typically are classes called 'OTUs' (Operational Taxonomic Units).  The OTUs can represent biological species, but also may be drawn from higher or lower in a biological hierarchy, anywhere from molecules to communities.  The features to be compared among OTUs are rendered in an entity-attribute-value model sometimes referred to as the 'character-state data model'.  For a given character, such as 'beak length', each OTU has a state, such as 'short' or 'long'.  The differences between states are understood to emerge by a historical process of evolutionary transitions in state, represented by a model (or rules) of transitions along with a phylogenetic tree.  CDAO provides the framework for representing OTUs, trees, transformations, and characters.  The representation of characters and transformations may depend on imported ontologies for a specific type of character.	^\d{7}$	0000072	balhoff@renci.org	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CDAO_$1				False	CDAO	CDAO		CDAO	CDAO									cdao	cdao	CDAO

The CIViC Assertion (AID) summarizes a collection of Evidence Items (EIDs) that covers predictive/therapeutic, diagnostic, prognostic or predisposing clinical information for a variant in a specific cancer context. CIViC currently has two main types of Assertions: those based on variants of primarily somatic origin (predictive/therapeutic, prognostic, and diagnostic) and those based on variants of primarily germline origin (predisposing). When the number and quality of Predictive, Prognostic, Diagnostic or Predisposing Evidence Items (EIDs) in CIViC sufficiently cover what is known for a particular variant and cancer type, then a corresponding assertion be created in CIViC.	^[0-9]+$	3		https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/$1				False												civic.aid											civic

For example, an Evidence Item might describe a line of evidence supporting the notion that tumors with a somatic BRAF V600 mutation generally respond well to the drug dabrafenib. A Variant may be a single nucleotide substitution, a small insertion or deletion, an RNA gene fusion, a chromosomal rearrangement, an RNA expression pattern (e.g. over-expression), etc. Each clinical Evidence statement corresponds to a single citable Source (a publication or conference abstract).	^[0-9]+$	1199		https://civicdb.org/links/evidence/$1				False												civic.eid											civic

civic.vid	CIViC variant	https://civicdb.org/	CIViC variants are usually genomic alterations, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertion/deletion events (indels), copy number alterations (CNV’s such as amplification or deletion), structural variants (SVs such as translocations and inversions), and other events that differ from the “normal” genome. In some cases a CIViC variant may represent events of the transcriptome or proteome. For example, ‘expression’ or ‘over-expression’ is a valid variant. Regardless of the variant, it must have a Predictive, Prognostic, Predisposing, Diagnostic, Oncogenic, or Functional relevance that is clinical in nature to be entered in CIViC. i.e. There must be some rationale for why curation of this variant could ultimately aid clinical decision making.	^[0-9]+$	12		https://civicdb.org/links/variant/$1				False												civic.vid										P3329	civic

commoncoreontology	Common Core Ontologies	http://www.ontologyrepository.com	"The Common Core Ontologies (CCO) comprise twelve ontologies that are designed to represent and integrate taxonomies of generic classes and relations across all domains of interest.

CCO is a mid-level extension of Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), an upper-level ontology framework widely used to structure and integrate ontologies in the biomedical domain (Arp, et al., 2015). BFO aims to represent the most generic categories of entity and the most generic types of relations that hold between them, by defining a small number of classes and relations. CCO then extends from BFO in the sense that every class in CCO is asserted to be a subclass of some class in BFO, and that CCO adopts the generic relations defined in BFO (e.g., has_part) (Smith and Grenon, 2004). Accordingly, CCO classes and relations are heavily constrained by the BFO framework, from which it inherits much of its basic semantic relationships."

dolce	Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering	http://www.loa.istc.cnr.it/dolce/overview.html	DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering) is a foundational ontology developed as part of the WonderWeb Foundational Ontologies Library (WFOL).  The development of this library has been guided by the need of a reliable set of foundational ontologies that can serve as 1) astarting point for building other ontologies, 2) a reference point for easy and rigorous comparisons among different ontological approaches, and 3) a rigorous basis for analyzing, harmonizing and integrating existing ontologies and metadata standards (by manually mapping them into some general module(s) in the library). DOLCE is the first module of WFOL and it is not a candidate for a universal standard ontology. Rather, it is intended as a starting point for comparing and elucidating the relationships with the other modules of the library, and also for clarifying the hidden assumptions underlying existing ontologies or linguistic resources such as WordNet.  As reflected by its acronym, DOLCE has a clear cognitive bias, in the sense that it aims at capturing the ontological categories underlying natural language and human commonsense. DOLCE is an ontology that focuses on particulars in the sense that its domain of discourse is restricted to them. The project is complete, though the ontology remains available for use.

interlex	InterLex	https://www.fdilab.org	InterLex is a dynamic lexicon, initially built on the foundation of NeuroLex (PMID: 24009581), of biomedical terms and common data elements designed to help improve the way that biomedical scientists communicate about their data, so that information systems can find data more easily and provide more powerful means of integrating data across distributed resources and datasets. InterLex allows for the association of data fields and data values to common data elements and terminologies enabling the crowdsourcing of data-terminology mappings within and across communities. InterLex provides a stable layer on top of the many other existing terminologies, lexicons, ontologies, and common data element collections and provides a set of inter-lexical and inter-data-lexical mappings. 	^[0-9]+$	0101963		https://scicrunch.org/scicrunch/interlex/view/ilx_$1			ILX	False												ilx										P696

In this backdrop, we have developed a comprehensive ontology on primary and established cell lines-both normal and pathologic. It covers around 400 cell lines. This ontology has been built to include the major domains in the field of biology like anatomy, bio-molecules, chemicals and drugs, pathological conditions and genetic variations around the cell lines. An extensive network of relations has been built across these concepts to enable different combinations of queries. The ontology covers all cell lines from major sources like ATCC, DSMZ, ECACC, ICLC etc. and is built in OWL format.

OGMS includes very general terms that are used across medical disciplines, including: 'disease', 'disorder', 'disease course', 'diagnosis', 'patient', and 'healthcare provider'. OGMS uses the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as an upper-level ontology. The scope of OGMS is restricted to humans, but many terms can be applied to a variety of organisms. OGMS provides a formal theory of disease that can be further elaborated by specific disease ontologies. This theory is implemented using OWL-DL and OBO Relation Ontology relations and is available in OWL and OBO formats.

OGMS is based on the papers Toward an Ontological Treatment of Disease and Diagnosis and On Carcinomas and Other Pathological Entities. The ontology attempts to address some of the issues raised at the Workshop on Ontology of Diseases (Dallas, TX) and the Signs, Symptoms, and Findings Workshop(Milan, Italy).
