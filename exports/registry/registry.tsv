cdao	Comparative Data Analysis Ontology	https://github.com/evoinfo/cdao	The Comparative Data Analysis Ontology (CDAO) provides a framework for understanding data in the context of evolutionary-comparative analysis.  This comparative approach is used commonly in bioinformatics and other areas of biology to draw inferences from a comparison of differently evolved versions of something, such as differently evolved versions of a protein.  In this kind of analysis, the things-to-be-compared typically are classes called 'OTUs' (Operational Taxonomic Units).  The OTUs can represent biological species, but also may be drawn from higher or lower in a biological hierarchy, anywhere from molecules to communities.  The features to be compared among OTUs are rendered in an entity-attribute-value model sometimes referred to as the 'character-state data model'.  For a given character, such as 'beak length', each OTU has a state, such as 'short' or 'long'.  The differences between states are understood to emerge by a historical process of evolutionary transitions in state, represented by a model (or rules) of transitions along with a phylogenetic tree.  CDAO provides the framework for representing OTUs, trees, transformations, and characters.  The representation of characters and transformations may depend on imported ontologies for a specific type of character.		0000072	balhoff@renci.org	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CDAO_$1				False			CDAO							CDAO	cdao	CDAO		CDAO

ogms	Ontology for General Medical Science	https://github.com/OGMS/ogms	"The Ontology for General Medical Science (OGMS) is an ontology of entities involved in a clinical encounter. OGMS includes very general terms that are used across medical disciplines, including: 'disease', 'disorder', 'disease course', 'diagnosis', 'patient', and 'healthcare provider'. OGMS uses the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as an upper-level ontology. The scope of OGMS is restricted to humans, but many terms can be applied to a variety of organisms. OGMS provides a formal theory of disease that can be further elaborated by specific disease ontologies. This theory is implemented using OWL-DL and OBO Relation Ontology relations and is available in OWL and OBO formats.

OGMS is based on the papers Toward an Ontological Treatment of Disease and Diagnosis and On Carcinomas and Other Pathological Entities. The ontology attempts to address some of the issues raised at the Workshop on Ontology of Diseases (Dallas, TX) and the Signs, Symptoms, and Findings Workshop(Milan, Italy). OGMS was formerly called the clinical phenotype ontology.

om	Ontology of units of Measure	https://github.com/HajoRijgersberg/OM	The OM ontology provides classes, instances, and properties that represent the different concepts used for defining and using measures and units. It includes, for instance, common units such as the SI units meter and kilogram, but also units from other systems of units such as the mile or nautical mile. For many application areas it includes more specific units and quantities, such as the unit of the Hubble constant: km/s/Mpc, or the quantity vaselife.  OM defines the complete set of concepts in the domain as distinguished in the textual standards. As a result the ontology can answer a wider range of competency questions than the existing approaches do. The following application areas are supported by OM:  Geometry; Mechanics; Thermodynamics; Electromagnetism; Fluid mechanics; Chemical physics; Photometry; Radiometry and Radiobiology; Nuclear physics; Astronomy and Astrophysics; Cosmology; Earth science; Meteorology; Material science; Microbiology; Economics; Information technology; Typography; Shipping; Food engineering; Post-harvest; technology; Dynamics of texture and taste; Packaging		Dimension	hajo.rijgersberg@wur.nl					False			OM								om

Depending on the database, the homology information is structured in different ways. ORTH ontology accommodates these disparate data structures namely Hierarchical Orthologous Group (HOG), cluster of homologous sequences and homologous-pairwise relations between sequences. In addition to the specific ORTH terms, this specification includes terms of the imported ontologies (e.g. Semanticscience Integrated Ontology, SIO) which are pertinents to represent the information from various orthology databases in a homogeneous way.

prints	PRINTS compendium of protein fingerprints	http://www.bioinf.manchester.ac.uk/dbbrowser/sprint/	PRINTS is a compendium of protein fingerprints. A fingerprint is a group of conserved motifs used to characterise a protein family; its diagnostic power is refined by iterative scanning of a SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL composite. Usually the motifs do not overlap, but are separated along a sequence, though they may be contiguous in 3D-space. Fingerprints can encode protein folds and functionalities more flexibly and powerfully than can single motifs, full diagnostic potency deriving from the mutual context provided by motif neighbours.	^PR\d{5}$	PR00001		http://www.bioinf.manchester.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbbrowser/sprint/searchprintss.cgi?prints_accn=$1&display_opts=Prints&category=None&queryform=false&regexpr=off				False								prints	prints					PRINTS		PRINTS

The TXPO contains an is-a hierarchy that is organized into three layers: the top layer contains general terms, mostly derived from the Basic Formal Ontology. The intermediate layer contains biomedical terms in OBO foundry from UBERON, Cell Ontology, NCBI Taxon, ChEBI, Gene Ontology, PATO, OGG, INOH, HINO, NCIT, DOID and Relational ontology (RO). The lower layer contains toxicological terms.

In applied work, we have developed a prototype of TOXPILOT, a TOXic Process InterpretabLe knOwledge sysTem.
