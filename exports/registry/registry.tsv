They identify anything digital, physical, or abstract. ARKs are open, mainstream, non-paywalled, decentralized persistent identifiers that can be created by an organization as soon as it is registered with a NAAN (Name Assigning Authority Number). Once registered, an ARK organization can create unlimited numbers of ARKs and publicize them via the n2t.net global resolver or via their own local resolver.	^/*[0-9A-Za-z]+(?:/[\w/.=*+@\$-]*)?(?:\?.*)?$	/53355/cl010066723	jakkbl@gmail.com	http://n2t.net/ark:$1				False				ARK										ark	ark

It unifies vocabulary for HRA construction and usage—making it possible to ingest external data sources; supporting uniform tissue sample registration that includes the spatial positioning and semantic annotations within 3D reference organs; and supporting user-formulated cross-domain queries over tissue donor properties, anatomical structures, cell types, biomarkers, and 3D space. The CCF Ontology consists of three major ontologies. The Biological Structure Ontology records anatomical structures, cell types, and biomarkers (ASCT+B) and the relationships between them.  The ASCT+B tables are authored by human experts using templated Google Sheets. The biomarkers, cell types, and anatomical structures are mapped to existing ontologies (Uberon/FMA, CL, HGNC) whenever possible.  All relationships between anatomical structures and from cell types to anatomical structures are valid Uberon and CL relationships. The Spatial Ontology defines the shape, size, location, and rotation of experimental tissue and data major anatomical structures in the 3D Reference Object Library. The Specimen Ontology captures the sex, age, and other information on donors that provided tissue data used in the construction of the HRA.	^\S+$	extraction_set	katy@indiana.edu	https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/CCF/?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Fccf%2F$1				False	CCF				CCF												ccf					r3d100012657

cdno	Compositional Dietary Nutrition Ontology	https://cdno.info/	The CDNO provides structured terminologies to describe nutritional attributes of material entities that contribute to human diet. These terms are intended primarily to be associated with datasets that quantify concentration of chemical nutritional components derived from samples taken from any stage in the production of food raw materials (including from crops, livestock, fisheries) and through processing and supply chains. Additional knowledge associated with these dietary sources may be represented by terms that describe functional, physical and other attributes. Whilst recognising that dietary nutrients within food substrates may be present as complex and dynamic physical and chemical structures or mixtures, CDNO focuses on components typically quantified in an analytical chemistry laboratory. The primary CDNO class ‘dietary nutritional component’ contains hierarchical sets of terms organised to reflect commonly used classifications of chemical food composition. This class does not represent an exhaustive classification of chemical components, but focuses on structuring terms according to widely accepted categories. This class is independent of, but may be used in conjunction with, classes that describe ‘analytical methods’ for quantification, ‘physical properties’ or ‘dietary function’. Quantification data may be used and reported in research literature, to inform food composition tables and labelling, or for supply chain quality assurance and control. More specifically, terms within the ‘nutritional component concentration’ class may be used to represent quantification of components described in the ‘dietary nutritional component’ class. Concentration data are intended to be described in conjunction with post-composed metadata concepts, such as represented by the Food Ontology (FoodOn) ‘Food product by organism’, which derives from some food or anatomical entity and a NCBI organismal classification ontology (NCBITaxon) entity. The common vocabulary and relationships defined within CDNO should facilitate description, communication and exchange of material entity-derived nutritional composition datasets typically generated by analytical laboratories. The organisation of the vocabulary is structured to reflect common categories variously used by those involved in crop, livestock or other organismal production, associated R&D and breeding, as well as the food processing and supply sector, and nutritionists, inlcuding compilers and users of food composition databases. The CDNO therefore supports characterisation of genetic diversity and management of biodiversity collections, as well as sharing of knowledge relating to dietary composition between a wider set of researchers, breeders, farmers, processors and other stakeholders. Further development of the functional class should also assist in understanding how interactions between organismal genetic and environmental variation contribute to human diet and health in the farm to fork continuum.	^\d{7}$	0000013	landreshdz@gmail.com	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CDNO_$1				False	CDNO	CDNO			CDNO											cdno	cdno	CDNO

civic.aid	CIViC Assertion	https://civicdb.org/	A CIViC assertion classifies the clinical significance of a variant-disease relationship under recognized guidelines. The CIViC Assertion (AID) summarizes a collection of Evidence Items (EIDs) that covers predictive/therapeutic, diagnostic, prognostic or predisposing clinical information for a variant in a specific cancer context. CIViC currently has two main types of Assertions: those based on variants of primarily somatic origin (predictive/therapeutic, prognostic, and diagnostic) and those based on variants of primarily germline origin (predisposing). When the number and quality of Predictive, Prognostic, Diagnostic or Predisposing Evidence Items (EIDs) in CIViC sufficiently cover what is known for a particular variant and cancer type, then a corresponding assertion be created in CIViC.	^[0-9]+$	3	mgriffit@wustl.edu	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/$1			civic.assertion	False														civic.aid														civic		
civic.did	CIViC Disease	https://civicdb.org/	Within the CIViC database, the disease should be the cancer or cancer subtype that is a result of the described variant.

civic.eid	CIViC Evidence	https://civicdb.org/	Evidence Items are the central building block of the Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer (CIViC) knowledgebase. The clinical Evidence Item is a piece of information that has been manually curated from trustable medical literature about a Variant or genomic ‘event’ that has implications in cancer Predisposition, Diagnosis (aka molecular classification), Prognosis, Predictive response to therapy, Oncogenicity or protein Function. For example, an Evidence Item might describe a line of evidence supporting the notion that tumors with a somatic BRAF V600 mutation generally respond well to the drug dabrafenib. A Variant may be a single nucleotide substitution, a small insertion or deletion, an RNA gene fusion, a chromosomal rearrangement, an RNA expression pattern (e.g. over-expression), etc. Each clinical Evidence statement corresponds to a single citable Source (a publication or conference abstract).	^[0-9]+$	1199	mgriffit@wustl.edu	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence/$1			civic.evidence	False														civic.eid														civic		
civic.gid	CIViC gene	https://civicdb.org/	A CIViC Gene Summary is created to provide a high-level overview of clinical relevance of cancer variants for the gene. Gene Summaries in CIViC focus on emphasizing the clinical relevance from a molecular perspective rather than describing the biological function of the gene unless necessary to contextualize its clinical relevance in cancer. Gene Summaries include relevant cancer subtypes, specific treatments for the gene’s associated variants, pathway interactions, functional alterations caused by the variants in the gene, and normal/abnormal functions of the gene with associated roles in oncogenesis	^[0-9]+$	272	mgriffit@wustl.edu	https://civicdb.org/links/gene/$1			civic.gene	False														civic.gid												P11277		civic		
civic.mpid	CIViC Molecular Profile	https://civicdb.org/	CIViC Molecular Profiles are combinations of one or more CIViC variants. Most Molecular Profiles are “Simple” Molecular Profiles comprised of a single variant. In most cases, these can be considered equivalent to the CIViC concept of a Variant. However, increasingly clinical significance must be considered in the context of multiple variants simultaneously. Complex Molecular Profiles in CIViC allow for curation of such variant combinations. Regardless of the nature of the Molecular Profile (Simple or Complex), it must have a Predictive, Prognostic, Predisposing, Diagnostic, Oncogenic, or Functional clinical relevance to be entered in CIViC.	^[0-9]+$	559	mgriffit@wustl.edu	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profile/$1			civic.molecularprofile	False														civic.mpid																
civic.sid	CIViC Source	https://civicdb.org/	In CIViC, each Evidence Item must be associated with a Source Type and Source ID, which link the Evidence Item to the original source of information supporting clinical claims. Currently, CIViC accepts publications indexed on PubMed OR abstracts published through the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). Each such source entered into CIViC is assigned a unique identifier and expert curators can curate guidance that assists future curators in the interpretation of information from this source.	^[0-9]+$	62	mgriffit@wustl.edu	https://civicdb.org/links/sources/$1			civic.source	False														civic.sid														civic		
civic.tid	CIViC Therapy	https://civicdb.org/	Therapies (often drugs) in CIViC are associated with Predictive Evidence Types, which describe sensitivity, resistance or adverse response to therapies when a given variant is present. The Therapy field may also be used to describe more general treatment types and regimes, such as FOLFOX or Radiation, as long as the literature derived Evidence Item makes a scientific association between the Therapy (treatment type) and the presence of the variant.	^[0-9]+$	14	mgriffit@wustl.edu	https://civicdb.org/links/drugs/$1			civic.therapy	False														civic.tid														civic		
civic.vgid	CIViC Variant Group	https://civicdb.org/	Variant Groups in CIViC provide user-defined grouping of Variants within and between genes based on unifying characteristics. CIViC curators are required to define a cohesive rationale for grouping these variants together, summarize their relevance to cancer diagnosis, prognosis or treatment and highlight any treatments or cancers of particular relevance	^[0-9]+$	16	mgriffit@wustl.edu	https://civicdb.org/links/variant_group/$1			civic.variantgroup	False														civic.vgid																
civic.vid	CIViC variant	https://civicdb.org/	CIViC variants are usually genomic alterations, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertion/deletion events (indels), copy number alterations (CNV’s such as amplification or deletion), structural variants (SVs such as translocations and inversions), and other events that differ from the “normal” genome. In some cases a CIViC variant may represent events of the transcriptome or proteome. For example, ‘expression’ or ‘over-expression’ is a valid variant. Regardless of the variant, it must have a Predictive, Prognostic, Predisposing, Diagnostic, Oncogenic, or Functional relevance that is clinical in nature to be entered in CIViC. i.e. There must be some rationale for why curation of this variant could ultimately aid clinical decision making.	^[0-9]+$	12	mgriffit@wustl.edu	https://civicdb.org/links/variant/$1			civic.variant	False														civic.vid												P3329		civic

commoncoreontology	Common Core Ontologies	http://www.ontologyrepository.com	"The Common Core Ontologies (CCO) comprise twelve ontologies that are designed to represent and integrate taxonomies of generic classes and relations across all domains of interest.

CCO is a mid-level extension of Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), an upper-level ontology framework widely used to structure and integrate ontologies in the biomedical domain (Arp, et al., 2015). BFO aims to represent the most generic categories of entity and the most generic types of relations that hold between them, by defining a small number of classes and relations. CCO then extends from BFO in the sense that every class in CCO is asserted to be a subclass of some class in BFO, and that CCO adopts the generic relations defined in BFO (e.g., has_part) (Smith and Grenon, 2004). Accordingly, CCO classes and relations are heavily constrained by the BFO framework, from which it inherits much of its basic semantic relationships."

dolce	Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering	http://www.loa.istc.cnr.it/dolce/overview.html	DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering) is a foundational ontology developed as part of the WonderWeb Foundational Ontologies Library (WFOL).  The development of this library has been guided by the need of a reliable set of foundational ontologies that can serve as 1) astarting point for building other ontologies, 2) a reference point for easy and rigorous comparisons among different ontological approaches, and 3) a rigorous basis for analyzing, harmonizing and integrating existing ontologies and metadata standards (by manually mapping them into some general module(s) in the library). DOLCE is the first module of WFOL and it is not a candidate for a universal standard ontology. Rather, it is intended as a starting point for comparing and elucidating the relationships with the other modules of the library, and also for clarifying the hidden assumptions underlying existing ontologies or linguistic resources such as WordNet.  As reflected by its acronym, DOLCE has a clear cognitive bias, in the sense that it aims at capturing the ontological categories underlying natural language and human commonsense. DOLCE is an ontology that focuses on particulars in the sense that its domain of discourse is restricted to them. The project is complete, though the ontology remains available for use.

OGMS includes very general terms that are used across medical disciplines, including: 'disease', 'disorder', 'disease course', 'diagnosis', 'patient', and 'healthcare provider'. OGMS uses the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as an upper-level ontology. The scope of OGMS is restricted to humans, but many terms can be applied to a variety of organisms. OGMS provides a formal theory of disease that can be further elaborated by specific disease ontologies. This theory is implemented using OWL-DL and OBO Relation Ontology relations and is available in OWL and OBO formats.

OGMS is based on the papers Toward an Ontological Treatment of Disease and Diagnosis and On Carcinomas and Other Pathological Entities. The ontology attempts to address some of the issues raised at the Workshop on Ontology of Diseases (Dallas, TX) and the Signs, Symptoms, and Findings Workshop(Milan, Italy).

psdo	Performance Summary Display Ontology	https://github.com/Display-Lab/psdo	"Performance Summary Display Ontology (PSDO) is an application ontology about motivating information in performance summaries and the visual and textual entities that are used to communicate about performance. Motivating information includes performance comparisons and changes that motivate improvement or sustainment, such as improvement towards a goal, loss of high performer status, or the presence of a performance gap. Visual and textual entities include charts, tables, and graphs that display performance information. PSDO's domain focus is healthcare organizations that use clinical quality dashboards and feedback interventions for healthcare professionals and teams. Performance information is commonly about the quality of care and health outcomes that have been derived from clinical data using performance measures (aka metrics, process indicators, quality measures, etc). PSDO uses Basic Formal Ontology as its upper level ontology. This work is supported by the NIH, National Library of Medicine (1K01LM012528-01, 1R01LM013894-01).

tgn	Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names	https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/	TGN is a structured vocabulary currently containing around 1,106,000 names and other information about places. Names for a place may include names in the vernacular language, English, other languages, historical names, names and in natural order and inverted order. Among these names, one is flagged as the preferred name. TGN is a thesaurus, compliant with ISO and NISO standards for thesaurus construction; it contains hierarchical, equivalence, and associative relationships. Note that TGN is not a GIS (Geographic Information System). While many records in TGN include coordinates, these coordinates are approximate and are intended for reference only. The focus of each TGN record is a place. There are around 912,000 places in the TGN. In the database, each place record (also called a subject) is identified by a unique numeric ID. Linked to the record for the place are names, the place's parent or position in the hierarchy, other relationships, geographic coordinates, notes, sources for the data, and place types, which are terms describing the role of the place (e.g., inhabited place and state capital). The temporal coverage of the TGN ranges from prehistory to the present and the scope is global. The TGN is a hierarchical database; its trees branch from a root called Top of the TGN hierarchies (Subject_ID: 1000000). Currently there are two TGN facets, World and Extraterrestrial Places. Under the facet World, places are arranged in hierarchies generally representing the current political and physical world, although some historical nations and empires are also included. There may be multiple broader contexts, making the TGN polyhierarchical. The primary users of the Getty vocabularies include museums, art libraries, archives, visual resource collection catalogers, bibliographic projects concerned with art, researchers in art and art history, and the information specialists who are dealing with the needs of these users.
