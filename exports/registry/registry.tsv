cdao	Comparative Data Analysis Ontology	https://github.com/evoinfo/cdao	The Comparative Data Analysis Ontology (CDAO) provides a framework for understanding data in the context of evolutionary-comparative analysis.  This comparative approach is used commonly in bioinformatics and other areas of biology to draw inferences from a comparison of differently evolved versions of something, such as differently evolved versions of a protein.  In this kind of analysis, the things-to-be-compared typically are classes called 'OTUs' (Operational Taxonomic Units).  The OTUs can represent biological species, but also may be drawn from higher or lower in a biological hierarchy, anywhere from molecules to communities.  The features to be compared among OTUs are rendered in an entity-attribute-value model sometimes referred to as the 'character-state data model'.  For a given character, such as 'beak length', each OTU has a state, such as 'short' or 'long'.  The differences between states are understood to emerge by a historical process of evolutionary transitions in state, represented by a model (or rules) of transitions along with a phylogenetic tree.  CDAO provides the framework for representing OTUs, trees, transformations, and characters.  The representation of characters and transformations may depend on imported ontologies for a specific type of character.	^\d{7}$	0000072	balhoff@renci.org	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CDAO_$1				False	CDAO	CDAO	CDAO	CDAO								cdao	cdao	CDAO

CIViC currently has two main types of Assertions: those based on variants of primarily somatic origin (predictive/therapeutic, prognostic, and diagnostic) and those based on variants of primarily germline origin (predisposing). When the number and quality of Predictive, Prognostic, Diagnostic or Predisposing Evidence Items (EIDs) in CIViC sufficiently cover what is known for a particular variant and cancer type, then a corresponding assertion be created in CIViC.	^[0-9]+$	3		https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/$1				False										civic.aid

For example, an Evidence Item might describe a line of evidence supporting the notion that tumors with a somatic BRAF V600 mutation generally respond well to the drug dabrafenib. A Variant may be a single nucleotide substitution, a small insertion or deletion, an RNA gene fusion, a chromosomal rearrangement, an RNA expression pattern (e.g. over-expression), etc. Each clinical Evidence statement corresponds to a single citable Source (a publication or conference abstract).	^[0-9]+$	1199		https://civicdb.org/links/evidence/$1				False										civic.eid

InterLex allows for the association of data fields and data values to common data elements and terminologies enabling the crowdsourcing of data-terminology mappings within and across communities. InterLex provides a stable layer on top of the many other existing terminologies, lexicons, ontologies, and common data element collections and provides a set of inter-lexical and inter-data-lexical mappings. 	^[0-9]+$	0101963		https://scicrunch.org/scicrunch/interlex/view/ilx_$1			ILX	False										ilx

OCIs can also be created for bibliographic resources described in an external bibliographic database, if they are similarly identified there by identifiers having a unique numerical part.

OGMS includes very general terms that are used across medical disciplines, including: 'disease', 'disorder', 'disease course', 'diagnosis', 'patient', and 'healthcare provider'. OGMS uses the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as an upper-level ontology. The scope of OGMS is restricted to humans, but many terms can be applied to a variety of organisms. OGMS provides a formal theory of disease that can be further elaborated by specific disease ontologies. This theory is implemented using OWL-DL and OBO Relation Ontology relations and is available in OWL and OBO formats.

OGMS is based on the papers Toward an Ontological Treatment of Disease and Diagnosis and On Carcinomas and Other Pathological Entities. The ontology attempts to address some of the issues raised at the Workshop on Ontology of Diseases (Dallas, TX) and the Signs, Symptoms, and Findings Workshop(Milan, Italy).
