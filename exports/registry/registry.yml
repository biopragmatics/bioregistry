  description: The Comparative Data Analysis Ontology (CDAO) provides a framework
    for understanding data in the context of evolutionary-comparative analysis.  This
    comparative approach is used commonly in bioinformatics and other areas of biology
    to draw inferences from a comparison of differently evolved versions of something,
    such as differently evolved versions of a protein.  In this kind of analysis,
    the things-to-be-compared typically are classes called 'OTUs' (Operational Taxonomic
    Units).  The OTUs can represent biological species, but also may be drawn from
    higher or lower in a biological hierarchy, anywhere from molecules to communities.  The
    features to be compared among OTUs are rendered in an entity-attribute-value model
    sometimes referred to as the 'character-state data model'.  For a given character,
    such as 'beak length', each OTU has a state, such as 'short' or 'long'.  The differences
    between states are understood to emerge by a historical process of evolutionary
    transitions in state, represented by a model (or rules) of transitions along with
    a phylogenetic tree.  CDAO provides the framework for representing OTUs, trees,
    transformations, and characters.  The representation of characters and transformations
    may depend on imported ontologies for a specific type of character.

    DANDI references electrical and optical cellular neurophysiology recordings and
    associated MRI and/or optical imaging data.

    These data will help scientists uncover and understand cellular level mechanisms
    of brain function. Scientists will study the formation of neural networks, how
    cells and networks enable functions such as learning and memory, and how these
    functions are disrupted in neurological disorders.'

  description: The Ontology for Biobanking (OBIB) is an ontology for the annotation
    and modeling of the activities, contents, and administration of a biobank. Biobanks
    are facilities that store specimens, such as bodily fluids and tissues, typically
    along with specimen annotation and clinical data. OBIB is based on a subset of
    the Ontology for Biomedical Investigation (OBI), has the Basic Formal Ontology
    (BFO) as its upper ontology, and is developed following OBO Foundry principles.
    The first version of OBIB resulted from the merging of two existing biobank-related
    ontologies, OMIABIS and biobank ontology.

  description: 'The Ontology for General Medical Science (OGMS) is an ontology of
    entities involved in a clinical encounter. OGMS includes very general terms that
    are used across medical disciplines, including: ''disease'', ''disorder'', ''disease
    course'', ''diagnosis'', ''patient'', and ''healthcare provider''. OGMS uses the
    Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as an upper-level ontology. The scope of OGMS is restricted
    to humans, but many terms can be applied to a variety of organisms. OGMS provides
    a formal theory of disease that can be further elaborated by specific disease
    ontologies. This theory is implemented using OWL-DL and OBO Relation Ontology
    relations and is available in OWL and OBO formats.


    OGMS is based on the papers Toward an Ontological Treatment of Disease and Diagnosis
    and On Carcinomas and Other Pathological Entities. The ontology attempts to address
    some of the issues raised at the Workshop on Ontology of Diseases (Dallas, TX)
    and the Signs, Symptoms, and Findings Workshop(Milan, Italy). OGMS was formerly
    called the clinical phenotype ontology. Terms from OGMS hang from the Basic Formal
    Ontology.'

    etc.). By sequence homology data, we mostly mean gene region, gene and protein
    centric orthology, paralogy, and xenology information. Depending on the database,
    the homology information is structured in different ways. ORTH ontology accommodates
    these disparate data structures namely Hierarchical Orthologous Group (HOG), cluster
    of homologous sequences and homologous-pairwise relations between sequences. In
    addition to the specific ORTH terms, this specification includes terms of the
    imported ontologies (e.g. Semanticscience Integrated Ontology, SIO) which are
    pertinents to represent the information from various orthology databases in a
    homogeneous way.'

prints:
  description: PRINTS is a compendium of protein fingerprints. A fingerprint is a
    group of conserved motifs used to characterise a protein family; its diagnostic
    power is refined by iterative scanning of a SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL composite. Usually
    the motifs do not overlap, but are separated along a sequence, though they may
    be contiguous in 3D-space. Fingerprints can encode protein folds and functionalities
    more flexibly and powerfully than can single motifs, full diagnostic potency deriving
    from the mutual context provided by motif neighbours.

    displays in clinical dashboards and feedback interventions for healthcare professionals
    and teams. The displays commonly show information about the quality of care and
    health outcomes that has been derived from clinical data using performance measures
    (aka metrics, process indicators, quality measures, etc). PSDO uses Basic Formal
    Ontology as its upper level ontology. This work is not peer-reviewed.

    imaging filters. Due to a recent collaboration with the IBSI (International Biomarkers
    Standardization Initiative), the ontology has been expanded (v 1.6) and it includes
    all the entities presented in the IBSI document. Therefore, a broad coverage of
    not only radiomics features, but also every entity (e.g. software properties,
    filter properties, features extraction parameters) involved into radiomics computation
    has been added. In the latest version (v2.0), the ontology URIs have been updated
    to reflect the codes avaialble in the IBSI latest manual. [bioportal]

    Typically these functional RNAs often have a conserved secondary structure which
    may be better preserved than the RNA sequence. The CMs used to describe each family
    are a slightly more complicated relative of the profile hidden Markov models (HMMs)
    used by Pfam. CMs can simultaneously model RNA sequence and the structure in an

  description: 'Elucidating the mechanism of toxicity is crucial in drug safety evaluations.
    TOXic Process Ontology (TXPO) systematizes a wide variety of terms involving toxicity
    courses and processes. The first version of TXPO focuses on liver toxicity.


    The TXPO contains an is-a hierarchy that is organized into three layers: the top
    layer contains general terms, mostly derived from the Basic Formal Ontology. The
    intermediate layer contains biomedical terms in OBO foundry from UBERON, Cell
    Ontology, NCBI Taxon, ChEBI, Gene Ontology, PATO, OGG, INOH, HINO, NCIT, DOID
    and Relational ontology (RO). The lower layer contains toxicological terms.


    In applied work, we have developed a prototype of TOXPILOT, a TOXic Process InterpretabLe
    knOwledge sysTem. TOXPILOT provides visualization maps of the toxic course, which
    facilitates capturing the comprehensive picture for understanding toxicity mechanisms.

  description: Veterinary pharmaceuticals are biologically active and potentially
    persistent substances which are recognised as a continuing threat to environmental
    quality. Whilst the environmental risk of agricultural pesticides has had considerable
    attention in recent decades, risks assessments for veterinary pharmaceuticals
    have only relatively recently began to be addressed. Risk assessments and risk
    modelling tend to be inherently data hungry processes and one of the main obstacles
    to consistent, accurate and efficient assessments is the need for a reliable,
    quality and comprehensive data source.

  description: The Yeast Resource Center Public Data Repository (YRC PDR) serves as
    a single point of access for the experimental data produced from many collaborations
    typically studying Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast). The experimental
    data include large amounts of mass spectrometry results from protein co-purification
    experiments, yeast two-hybrid interaction experiments, fluorescence microscopy
    images and protein structure predictions.
