    description: The BioAssay Ontology (BAO) describes biological screening assays
      and their results including high-throughput screening (HTS) data for the purpose
      of categorizing assays and data analysis. BAO is an extensible, knowledge-based,
      highly expressive (currently SHOIQ(D)) description of biological assays making
      use of descriptive logic based features of the Web Ontology Language (OWL).
      BAO currently has over 700 classes and also makes use of several other ontologies.
      It describes several concepts related to biological screening, including Perturbagen,
      Format, Meta Target, Design, Detection Technology, and Endpoint. Perturbagens
      are perturbing agents that are screened in an assay; they are mostly small molecules.
      Assay Meta Target describes what is known about the biological system and /
      or its components interrogated in the assay (and influenced by the Perturbagen).
      Meta target can be directly described as a molecular entity (e.g. a purified
      protein or a protein complex), or indirectly by a biological process or event
      (e.g. phosphorylation). Format describes the biological or chemical features
      common to each test condition in the assay and includes biochemical, cell-based,
      organism-based, and variations thereof. The assay Design describes the assay
      methodology and implementation of how the perturbation of the biological system
      is translated into a detectable signal. Detection Technology relates to the
      physical method and technical details to detect and record a signal. Endpoints
      are the final HTS results as they are usually published (such as IC50, percent
      inhibition, etc). BAO has been designed to accommodate multiplexed assays. All
      main BAO components include multiple levels of sub-categories and specification
      classes, which are linked via object property relationships forming an expressive
      knowledge-based representation.

    description: The Comparative Data Analysis Ontology (CDAO) provides a framework
      for understanding data in the context of evolutionary-comparative analysis.  This
      comparative approach is used commonly in bioinformatics and other areas of biology
      to draw inferences from a comparison of differently evolved versions of something,
      such as differently evolved versions of a protein.  In this kind of analysis,
      the things-to-be-compared typically are classes called 'OTUs' (Operational Taxonomic
      Units).  The OTUs can represent biological species, but also may be drawn from
      higher or lower in a biological hierarchy, anywhere from molecules to communities.  The
      features to be compared among OTUs are rendered in an entity-attribute-value
      model sometimes referred to as the 'character-state data model'.  For a given
      character, such as 'beak length', each OTU has a state, such as 'short' or 'long'.  The
      differences between states are understood to emerge by a historical process
      of evolutionary transitions in state, represented by a model (or rules) of transitions
      along with a phylogenetic tree.  CDAO provides the framework for representing
      OTUs, trees, transformations, and characters.  The representation of characters
      and transformations may depend on imported ontologies for a specific type of
      character.

    description: The VEuPathDB ontology is an application ontology developed to encode
      our understanding of what data is about in the public resources developed and
      maintained by the Eukaryotic Pathogen, Host and Vector Genomics Resource (VEuPathDB;
      https://veupathdb.org). The VEuPathDB ontology was previously named the EuPathDB
      ontology prior to EuPathDB joining with VectorBase.The ontology was built based
      on the Ontology of Biomedical Investigations (OBI) with integration of other
      OBO ontologies such as PATO, OGMS, DO, etc. as needed for coverage. Currently
      the VEuPath ontology is primarily intended to be used for support of the VEuPathDB
      sites. Terms with VEuPathDB ontology IDs that are not specific to VEuPathDB
      will be submitted to OBO Foundry ontologies for subsequent import and replacement
      of those terms when they are available.

    description: 'This artefact is an MSI-approved controlled vocabulary primarily
      developed under COSMOS EU and PhenoMeNal EU governance. The nmrCV is supporting
      the nmrML XML format with standardized terms. nmrML is a vendor agnostic open
      access NMR raw data standard. Its primaly role is analogous to the mzCV for
      the PSI-approved mzML XML format. It uses BFO2.0 as its Top level. This CV was
      derived from two predecessors (The NMR CV from the David Wishart Group, developed
      by Joseph Cruz) and the MSI nmr CV developed by Daniel Schober at the EBI.  This
      simple taxonomy of terms (no DL semantics used) serves the nuclear magnetic
      resonance markup language (nmrML) with meaningful descriptors to amend the nmrML
      xml file with CV terms. Metabolomics scientists are encouraged to use this CV
      to annotrate their raw and experimental context data, i.e. within nmrML. The
      approach to have an exchange syntax mixed of an xsd and CV stems from the PSI
      mzML effort. The reason to branch out from an xsd into a CV is, that in areas
      where the terminology is likely to change faster than the nmrML xsd could be
      updated and aligned, an externally and decentrallised maintained CV can accompensate
      for such dynamics in a more flexible way. A second reason for this set-up is
      that semantic validity of CV terms used in an nmrML XML instance (allowed CV
      terms, position/relation to each other, cardinality) can be validated by rule-based
      proprietary validators:  By means of cardinality specifications and XPath expressions
      defined in an XML mapping file (an instances of the CvMappingRules.xsd ), one
      can define what ontology terms are allowed in a specific location of the data
      model.'

    description: 'The Ontology for General Medical Science (OGMS) is an ontology of
      entities involved in a clinical encounter. OGMS includes very general terms
      that are used across medical disciplines, including: ''disease'', ''disorder'',
      ''disease course'', ''diagnosis'', ''patient'', and ''healthcare provider''.
      OGMS uses the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as an upper-level ontology. The scope
      of OGMS is restricted to humans, but many terms can be applied to a variety
      of organisms. OGMS provides a formal theory of disease that can be further elaborated
      by specific disease ontologies. This theory is implemented using OWL-DL and
      OBO Relation Ontology relations and is available in OWL and OBO formats.


      OGMS is based on the papers Toward an Ontological Treatment of Disease and Diagnosis
      and On Carcinomas and Other Pathological Entities. The ontology attempts to
      address some of the issues raised at the Workshop on Ontology of Diseases (Dallas,
      TX) and the Signs, Symptoms, and Findings Workshop(Milan, Italy). OGMS was formerly
      called the clinical phenotype ontology. Terms from OGMS hang from the Basic
      Formal Ontology.'

      The TXPO contains an is-a hierarchy that is organized into three layers: the
      top layer contains general terms, mostly derived from the Basic Formal Ontology.
      The intermediate layer contains biomedical terms in OBO foundry from UBERON,

      DOID and Relational ontology (RO). The lower layer contains toxicological terms.


      In applied work, we have developed a prototype of TOXPILOT, a TOXic Process

    description: The Vaccine Ontology (VO) is a biomedical ontology in the domain
      of vaccine and vaccination. VO aims to standardize vaccine annotation, integrate
      various vaccine data, and support computer-assisted reasoning.  VO supports
      basic vaccine R&D and clincal vaccine usage. VO is being developed as a community-based
      ontology with support and collaborations from the vaccine and bio-ontology communities.
