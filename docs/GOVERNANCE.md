# Governance

The goal of the Bioregistry is to enable community-driven curation and
maintenance of a registry of prefixes and their associated metadata. This is a
first suggestion for some minimal governance (heavily inspired
by https://github.com/mapping-commons/SSSOM/issues/82, since that is a similar
community-driven effort). Discussion for this governance is taking place
on https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioregistry/issues/156.

## Manually Updating the Bioregistry

- Manual updates to the contents of the Bioregistry (e.g., adding a new prefix,
  merging prefixes, splitting prefixes, or updating a prefix's associated
  metadata) must be done either in the form of an issue or a pull request.
- The only updates that aren't considered manual are the ones done by the CI
  system on a nightly basis.
- Manual updates can be accepted if all continuous integration tests pass and a
  member of the Bioregistry Review Team approves. It's best practice that a
  member of the Review Team does not approve their own updates.
- New prefixes must conform to
  https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioregistry/issues/158 and
  https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioregistry/issues/133 and the
  [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Attribution information for the requester and reviewer of manual updates
  must be collected in the form of an [ORCiD identifier](https://orcid.org).

## Review Team

The _Bioregistry Review Team_ is responsible for reviewing requests for new
prefixes, merging prefixes, splitting prefixes, and updating metadata associated
with prefixes. It is implemented as a GitHub team that has "triage"
permissions (e.g., able to maintain issues and pull requests).

Until all of the potential update interactions have been codified with GitHub
actions workflows, the review team is also responsible for either helping the
requester create an appropriate pull request or creating an appropriate pull
request directly if none has been given by the requester.

### Membership

- Membership to the Bioregistry Review Team is requested on the issue tracker
- Membership to the Bioregistry Review Team is granted at the discretion of the
  existing Bioregistry Review Team
  using [Disapproval Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disapproval_voting)

- Add to membership list below in alphabetical order by last name in along with
  their GitHub handle, ORCID identifier, and date of joining.

#### Removing Members

## Core Development Team

The _Core Development Team_ is responsible for maintaining the codebase
associated with the Bioregistry, which includes the Python package, the
Bioregistry web application, docker configurations/artifacts, and related GitHub
repositories. It is implemented as a GitHub team that has "maintain"
permissions (e.g., able to write to the repo as well as maintain issues and pull
requests).

Contributions to the Bioregistry code must be submitted as pull requests
to https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioregistry. They must conform to
the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). Code contributions must be
approved by a member of the Core Development Team as well as pass continuous
integration tests before merging.

### Membership

- Membership to the Bioregistry Core Development Team is requested on the issue
  tracker
- It is required that a potential member of the Bioregistry Core Development
  Team has previously made a contribution as an external contributor (to which
  there are no requirements)
- Membership to the Bioregistry Core Development Team is granted at the
  discretion of the existing Bioregistry Core Development Team
  using [Disapproval Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disapproval_voting)
- Members must be listed alphabetically by family name [below](#members-1)

## Publications / Attribution

All members of the core development and review teams are automatically authors
on Bioregistry papers and can propose other co-authors.

All contributors to the data underlying the Bioregistry, regardless of curation
size, should be considered for authorship on Bioregistry papers. These
contributions are automatically summarized at
https://bioregistry.io/contributors.

Larger external institutional contributors should be acknowledged in the 
following places, where appropriate:

- On the [support](https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioregistry#-support) and 
  [funding](https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioregistry#-funding) sections
  of the repository's main README.md
- On the [acknowledgements](https://bioregistry.io/acknowledgments) page of
  https://bioregistry.io

## Bootstrapping governance

This document's governance will go into effect after additional rounds of
editing and community discussion. The Bioregistry Review Team will announce when
it is officially in effect.

## Updating governance

This governance must updated through the following steps:

1. Create an issue on the
   Bioregistry's [issue tracker](https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioregistry/issues)
   describing the desired change and reasoning.
2. Engage potential stakeholders in discussion.
3. Solicit the Bioregistry Review Team for a review.
4. The Bioregistry Review Team will accept changes at their discretion.

This procedure doesn't apply to cosmetic or ergonomics changes, which are
allowed to be done in a more *ad-hoc* manner. The Bioregistry Review Team may
later make explicit criteria for accepting changes to this governance.
