title: Blacklist External Prefixes
permalink: /curation/blacklist-external

When curating unaligned external prefixes, many are either out of scope or
not possible to find minimum metadata and therefore should be explicitly
excluded from the Bioregistry.

1. Identify a prefix of interest from BioPortal (or another) curation
   sheet (e.g., [here](https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioregistry/blob/main/src/bioregistry/data/external/bioportal/curation.tsv))
2. Decide if it's out of scope:
    - Not enough information inside external registry's record to follow-up on
      what it is (i.e., `000467` in CHEMINF)
    - Is there evidence of this resource being used somewhere? Don't add
      resources that are one-off (e.g., many ontologies in BioPortal) as this
      pollutes the prefix pool and makes the burden of finding things harder
    - Double mapping to a Bioregistry prefix (there isn't currently a way to
      curate these)
    - Not about biomedical, chemical, clinical, or life sciences or
      meta-sciences
3. If out of scope, add to the SKIP list, either in the corresponding alignment
   python module or associated processing configuration (TODO this needs to be
   better standardized)

The PR [#41](https://github.com/semanticchemistry/semanticchemistry/issues/41)
demonstrates curating CHEMINF mappings including adding three explicit
blacklists.
